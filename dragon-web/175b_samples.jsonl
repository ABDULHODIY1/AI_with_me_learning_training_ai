"Glacier Ridge Christian School\n\nGlacier Ridge Christian School is a private Christian school in Johnstown, Ohio. It was founded in the fall of 1999 by Gary and Tammy Smith.\n\nThe school started with just 13 students in grades 5-8. By the end of the first year, the school had grown to 65 students in those same grades. As the school has continued to grow, so has the number of teachers.\n\nBy the year 2009, Glacier Ridge had expanded to offer a preschool through 12th grade education, and the school had grown to almost 200 students. In the fall of 2013, the enrollment was over 300 students.\n\nThe school started with the first graduating class of 2002. They are now on their 11th graduating class, and the school's graduates continue to receive acceptance to universities across the United States. The school offers several Advanced Placement classes.\n\nGlacier Ridge has had its students participate in various competitions and competitions. Most notable are the sports teams, especially their basketball teams, which have qualified for state competition multiple times. The school has also had various music groups participate in state and regional competitions, and in the 2010-2011 school year, the school sent students to participate in an International Children's Games competition in Romania.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 school year, a group of the school's teachers were sent to Haiti to help establish a new orphanage, \"Eli's Children's House\", which was dedicated to Eli Pierre, who had died in a motorcycle accident. They were instrumental in bringing the orphanage into the community by helping establish new programs for the children, including English as a Second Language, Computer Lab, and Physical Education classes. The teachers assisted in the education of the orphans as well as working with the staff on the property.\n\nThe school has also taken various trips over the years, including trips to Virginia and New York City. The school also hosted an educational trip to Washington D.C. for one of their graduating classes.\n\nThe school has participated in various community events and service projects. One of the most notable is their annual \"Twilight Prom\" that is held each spring. Each year, the school hosts a prom for local high school students who have special needs. The students' dates are typically their own siblings.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, a fire destroyed the school's auditorium, causing over $1 million in damages. After the school received an outpouring of support, the school was able to begin construction on a new auditorium in time for the next school year.\n\nIn 2015, Glacier Ridge Christian School became part of the Christian School Association of Northeast Ohio.\n\nThe School is affiliated with the Association of Christian Schools International, the Ohio Christian Education Association, and the Christian School Association of Northeast Ohio.\n\n<|endoftext|>2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season\n\nThe 2003 NCAA Division I-AA football season, part of college football in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association at the Division I Football Championship Subdivision level, began on September 6, 2003, and concluded with the National Championship Game of the NCAA Division I Football Championship on December 21, 2003, at Finley Stadium in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The Georgia Southern Eagles won their first I-AA championship, defeating the Furman Paladins by a final score of 27−10. \n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> \"Denotes host institution\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> \"Denotes host institution\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> \"Denotes host institution\"\n<|endoftext|>Adiadochokinesia\n\nAdiadochokinesia, or more fully dysdiadochokinesia, is a neurologic symptom, described as the inability to perform rapid alternating movements, as seen in ataxia.\n\nExamples of this are \n\nA classic test is \"the finger to nose test\". The examiner repeatedly taps the patient's finger with the examiner's finger and asks the patient to reciprocate in the same rhythm.\n\nThis should be distinguished from dysdiadochokinesia, a progressive condition involving more or less the same symptoms.\n<|endoftext|>Akyem Kotoku\n\nAkyem Kotoku is one of the five traditional districts of the Ashanti Empire. The people are collectively known as Akyem Kotokus.\n\nAkyem Kotoku lies in the Eastern region of Ashanti and is bounded by the East Mamprusi to the East, Nkwantanan to the North, Ashanti to the West and Ahanta West to the South. It is part of Ashanti Region. The area is mainly mountainous with some rich valleys and hills. Akyem Kotoku is known as the \"Area of Plenty\".\n\nThe people are mainly farmers and fishermen. Its capital is Akyem Kotoku. It has two paramountcies, Buokrom and Kumasi. Buokrom, the newest paramountcy, was established in 1975. The Akyem Kotoku Traditional Council has nine chiefs.\n\nThe major towns are Abokobi, Domenase, Akropong, and Nsuaem. Other settlements include Aduanful, Boankraful, Denkyemerem, Anhwiaso, Gyankroma, Kwabenya, Nananom, Obofram, Okwensu, Ofoase, Nkoranza, Nsutam, Aduaso, Adom, Ofram, Odomankoma, Asafo, Anyigbe, Obofram, Kwabenya, Denkyemerem, Odumase, Nsutam, Aduaso, Nsuaem, Nsuaso, Tafo-Nsuaem, Manhyia, Boaso, Adom, Ofram, Anhwiaso, Adoase, Anyigbe, Boankraful, Okwensu, Ofoase, Nkoranza, Akropong, Gyankroma, Domenase, Egyir, Afram, Denkyerem, Nananom, Akuapem South, Asafo, Aboadze and Koma.\n\nThe Akyem Kotoku Traditional Council has nine paramountcies.\n\nThe Akyem Kotoku people have two coats of arms, one to use at home and the other for international use.\n\nThe arms used at home is a gold shield with a black anchor in the center. On the shield is a white dove with a golden olive branch in its beak. The dove is supported by two black wild dogs facing each other.\n\nThe shield is surmounted by a gold mural crown with five points and black stripes.\n\nThe shield is supported by two black lions standing on a white scroll. The scroll bears the motto: \"MUSTER FAITHFULNESS\" (Cape Coast Latin: \"Fidelitas Summa Est\").\n\nThe arms used outside the country is a gold shield with a black ram's head in the center. On the shield is a green laurel wreath.\n\nThe shield is surmounted by a gold mural crown with five points and black stripes.\n\nThe shield is supported by two black and white wild dogs standing on a white scroll. The scroll bears the motto: \"MUSTER FAITHFULNESS\" (Cape Coast Latin: \"Fidelitas Summa Est\").\n\nThe two dogs represent vigilance. The two lions in the home arms represent fortitude and strength.\n\n<|endoftext|>Aulus Atilius Calatinus\n\nAulus Atilius Calatinus was consul of the Roman Republic in 221 BC with Gaius Claudius Nero. The primary action of the consulship was the siege and capture of the Volscian city of Suessa Pometia.\n\nIn the same year he was sent to Tarentum with a fleet of 10,000 infantry and 800 cavalry to aid the Tarentines in the Second War with the Bruttians. Calatinus was captured in a naval action off the coast near Tarentum, and the Bruttian admiral Lucerius was rewarded with his command for this victory. The Roman troops under his command, however, escaped to Thurii.\n\nThe earlier Aulus Atilius Calatinus was elected consul in 222 BC, and killed in a battle with the Samnites.\n\n<|endoftext|>Frederic Myers\n\nFrederic William Henry Myers (15 January 1843 – 18 January 1901) was a classical scholar, poet, playwright, novelist, and the founder of the Society for Psychical Research, which he led until his death.\n\nFrederic Myers was born at Kew, Surrey, the eldest son of Frederic Myers, a surgeon. He was educated at King's College School, and at St Paul's School in London. After a year at Trinity College, Cambridge (1861–2), he was a schoolmaster at Rugby from 1862 to 1871. In 1872 he became classical lecturer at University College, London. He became a member of the Council of the College (now part of UCL), and was appointed professor of Latin there in 1880. In 1876 Myers joined the Metaphysical Society, along with Alfred Tennyson, J. M. Barrie and others. His friendship with Barrie lasted for the remainder of his life, and Myers even accompanied Barrie and his wife on their honeymoon. Myers and Tennyson became close friends and met frequently in later years, as seen in their correspondence.\n\nMyers wrote prose and verse for periodicals, including a parody of Gerard Manley Hopkins, and some detective stories, and contributed to books of poetry and belles lettres, such as \"Whistler and His Art\" and the \"Yellow Book\". His poetry was praised by Henry James, who"

In fact, a lot of people who have been there say that China is much nicer.\n\n\n\nChina is not a poor country. They have tons of money and resources. Their problem is that they do not spend enough on infrastructure and don't value education as highly as they could. So their people do not make as much money as they could. And they don't have nice things. It is much nicer than India, but not as good as Japan. I would like to visit it, because I do not think I would be disappointed, but I don't expect it to be better than Japan.\n\n\n\nThey have a different mindset than us, and do things differently. Their government is not a democracy. It is a communist government. I think that is not a bad thing, and has it's benefits. They have much fewer guns and gun crime than we do. They are, for the most part, more honest than we are. Their infrastructure, while not as nice as ours, is very good. They spend more on infrastructure than we do. They have much more public transportation, and better public transportation. They are working on their environmental problems, and they have made more progress than we have. They have fewer social problems, and less crime than we do. They have a very good education system, especially compared to India.\n\n\n\nThey spend more money on schools and education, and invest more in their future, than we do.\n\n\n\nChina is a country that is far more well developed than many people in the US would think.\n\n\n\nThe fact that they have fewer guns, and better education and fewer social problems is probably why they have fewer school shootings than we do. I think we have way too many guns in this country, and that is a big part of the problem.\n\n\n\nJust my thoughts.<|endoftext|>\"Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord.\"\n\nEzekiel 33:11-11\n\nGod wants every sinner to be saved. He does not want people to perish but be saved. God hates sin, and sin destroys a person. But He loves people. He created them to have fellowship with Him and one day live in His Kingdom, and He does not want that for one person to be lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod's command to Ezekiel was that He was telling him to go and tell the people of Israel that they need to turn to God, because they were going to die if they did not. We know that Ezekiel told them the same thing, because God's word is truth. God's Word does not fail.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat God is saying is that people are going to die if they do not turn to Him. People who reject God will die. The Bible says in Romans 1:32, \"Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.\" God says that those people who do these things deserve death, and yet people continue to do them and approve of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod will not tolerate the sinful acts of humanity, but He wants every person to be saved. There is only one way to be saved. The Bible says in John 14:6, \"Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'”\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one can be saved except through Jesus Christ, but when people put Jesus as their savior, they are saved. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many people who call themselves Christians who say that God wants everyone to be saved, and they quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, but they don't realize that God's word is truth. God says in Revelation 21:8, \"But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is only one way to be saved, and it is not through anyone or anything but Jesus Christ. Jesus is the only way to heaven. God says that all the people who are going to perish are going to go to a place called the second death. That's hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people quote Ezekiel 33:11 and John 3:16, they don't realize that God's word is truth. They don't realize that when they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are not telling the truth. When they say that God wants everyone to be saved, they are putting God in a box, because God's word is truth. God says that those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior are going to perish. God's word is truth, and people who do not put their faith in Jesus Christ are going to die.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bible says in John 14:6, \"Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'”\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus is the only way to the Father, and no one can be saved except through Him. He died on the cross for our sins, and He rose from the dead on the third day, and He sits at the right hand of God, interceding for us. It's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at Ezekiel 33:11-11, and read it carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' declares the Sovereign Lord.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGod says that He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. God does not like it when people die. But God hates sin, and sin leads to death. If people want to live, they must turn from their sins and put their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf people don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. God doesn't want that. He doesn't want people to perish, but to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod wants people to put their faith in Jesus Christ. If people put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are saved. If they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ, they are going to perish. That's the truth. That's the message of Ezekiel 33:11-11.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople are going to die if they don't put their faith in Jesus Christ. People will perish. People will be lost. People will be doomed. People will go to hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's read Ezekiel 33:11-12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone,\" declares the Sovereign Lord. \"Repent and live!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGod takes no pleasure in the death of anyone. God does not want anyone to perish. He doesn't want anyone to die. He wants people to repent and live. God is saying that He is not going to stand back and watch as people perish. He's going to do something about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod says in Ezekiel 33:13-16, \"Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel? I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Do you think I take pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? Don't presume that you can say to yourselves"

Let's say I have the following array of numbers:\n\nvar myNumbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\nThe following snippet of code would display the same numbers in reverse order:\n\nfor ( var i = myNumbers.length - 1; i >= 0; i-- ) { console.log( myNumbers[i] ); }\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nWe know that the index of an array can be used as a \"pointer\" to the location in memory that contains a particular item in an array. If the array myNumbers has five items, then myNumbers[0] , myNumbers[1] , myNumbers[2] , myNumbers[3] and myNumbers[4] will point to the values 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nIn the previous example, the code starts with the length of the array (5) and subtracts one from it. As we know that index 0 in an array contains the first item in the array, the previous code will execute the following steps:\n\nTake the length of the array (5) Subtract 1 (so we now have 4) Start at the index that contains the first item in the array (myNumbers[4] = 3) and run down the array until we reach the last item in the array (myNumbers[3] = 5)\n\nSo the above code will end up displaying the items in the array in reverse order, starting at index 4 and working backwards to index 0.\n\nAt this point, we have a good idea of how we can access the values in an array in a specific order, but how do we go the other way?\n\nIt would be great if we could simply use the same code as above, but add a \"--\" operator before the last number. That way, we could add a simple parameter to the code to control the range of numbers it will use.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't do that. While JavaScript will happily work with -- , it will also happily take -- in code and convert it to -1 , or the last number in an array. That's not going to do us any good, as we want the code to be flexible enough that we can work with a number that we specify as the range of numbers.\n\nSo let's look at a simple function that can give us the results we need.\n\nfunction rotate(numbers, direction, number) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push(number); numbers.unshift(number); };\n\nThe rotate function above has three parameters, and will rotate the values in the numbers array.\n\nnumbers is the array we want to use.\n\ndirection is the parameter that allows us to choose whether we want the values to be rotated in the direction we specify. In this case, we've chosen direction to be either \"right\" or \"left\"\n\nnumber is the number we're using as the upper bound of the range that we want to use.\n\nLet's take a look at a simple example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, \"right\" ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\n\nAs we can see, the numbers array is simply rotated right by the number we specified. That's fine, but let's add in some code that we can use to control which numbers are displayed:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, \"right\", 1 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 1, 4, 3, 5, 2 ]\n\nWe can see that we've rotated the numbers so that the first number in the array is now number 1 , and the next number in the array is 4 .\n\nWe've also specified that we want to rotate in a right-handed manner, by passing \"right\" as the second parameter. This means that we have access to the following rotation values:\n\nrotate( numbers, \"left\" ); rotate( numbers, \"right\" ); rotate( numbers, \"right\" ); rotate( numbers, \"right\" ); rotate( numbers, \"left\" );\n\nIf we try to access the rotate function with \"left\" as the parameter, we'll see the following output:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotate( numbers, \"left\" ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nNot quite what we wanted, right?\n\nWhat we want is to be able to take an array, specify the number of numbers we want to display, and be able to choose the direction of rotation.\n\nWe also want to ensure that the values we are displaying are always within the array's bounds, and we're using them correctly.\n\nThe good news is that it's not too difficult to do this. We simply need to know what we want the code to look like, and write the code to do what we want it to do.\n\nLet's take a look at some simple code to display the numbers in an array in a given direction:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nrotateArray function\n\nThis is the code we'll use to display the numbers in the numbers array in the direction we specify. We'll start with a simple parameter:\n\nstartAt is the number we're displaying. It can either be the first number in the array, or any number within the array.\n\nLet's take a look at the code again:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing this simple function, we can take any number of numbers, and display them in the direction we want. Let's look at a quick example:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, \"left\", 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 4, 3, 5, 2, 1 ]\n\nThis time, we've used \"left\" as the direction, and we've also used the parameter \"3\" as the startAt value. The result is that we now have the numbers displayed in the array starting at the number 3 .\n\nIf we use a number that isn't within the bounds of the array, we'll get the following result:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, \"right\", 3 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nAs you can see, the direction we've specified is \"right\", and the value we've specified for startAt is 3 . Unfortunately, this value isn't within the bounds of the array, so the values in the array have been displayed starting from the last number in the array.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can use this code to work with a number that's outside the bounds of the array:\n\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; rotateArray( numbers, \"right\", 6 ); console.log( numbers ); //output: [ 5, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]\n\nThis time, we've specified \"right\" as the direction, and a value of 6 as the startAt parameter. The result is that we now have the values displayed in the array starting at the number 6 .\n\nThis time, the result we want is displayed in the array, but there's a problem. We don't want the number 6 to be the start of the array. Instead, we want it to be the last number in the array.\n\nThe good news is that we can easily handle this by modifying the code slightly:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { numbers.reverse(); numbers.push( startAt ); numbers.unshift( startAt ); };\n\nUsing the simple rotation code above, we can now take any array, specify the number we want to display, and choose the direction we want to use. This means we can write some simple code that can work with any number, regardless of its position in the array.\n\nThe next step is to write some code that can ensure the number we specify as the startAt is in the range that we expect.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can do that:\n\nfunction rotateArray( numbers, direction, startAt ) { if( startAt >= numbers.length ) { throw new RangeError(\"Start at is outside of the"

The Commandments in the New Testament\n\n8. Tolerance\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Meaning of Love\n\nBefore we can love others, we must know the meaning of love. It is important to love God and obey Him and to have a right relationship with Him. But to have a right relationship with Him we must love Him. That means that we must have a good relationship with all His laws.\n\nOf course we can't keep all the commandments all the time. Yet we must have a good relationship with them. Otherwise we will not know what God is like.\n\nLove is based on God's law.\n\nRomans 13:10. The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nGalatians 5:14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nLove is based on God's law. We should study God's commandments and know the laws He has given us. Then we will know how to have a good relationship with Him.\n\nOne reason we are to love God and obey Him is that it is important to have a good relationship with God. We need to know how much God loves us. Without knowing this we cannot have a right relationship with God. We need to have a good relationship with Him so we can be happy and serve Him better.\n\nLet us understand what love is.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nIn these verses John explained that love is the opposite of lawlessness. Love is the opposite of murder, hatred, malice, evil, adultery, stealing, lying, and a lot of other bad things.\n\nRomans 13:8-10. Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law. For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\n\nWe learn from this that the opposite of love is lawlessness. The opposite of love is murder, hatred, envy, malice, evil, and all the other things mentioned in these verses.\n\nVerse 10 says, \"Love does no harm to a neighbor.\" In other words, love is a good thing. It is a good thing to have a good relationship with God.\n\nRomans 13:8 says, \"Love does no harm to a neighbor.\" Love helps and blesses others.\n\nLove is a good thing. The reason love is a good thing is because God is love.\n\n1 John 4:16. And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love; and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.\n\nVerse 8 says, \"God is love.\" God's name is Love.\n\nGod's name is Love.\n\nJohn 4:8. … the well was deep; and I said, \"How shall I get down?\"\n\nAnd he said, \"Come, and I will show you.\"\n\n9. And he said, \"Draw you [a] little water out of the well, and … drink.\"\n\n10. And I said, \"Sir, give me [a] little to drink.\"\n\n11. And he said, \"Drink, my [b] son, and … your eyes shall be opened.\"\n\n12. And I drank, and it was as if I had had new vision given to me; for I could see [c] through those walls of water.\n\n13. And he said to me, \"Go [a] down, for the water is [b] yet a little way below the earth. …\n\n15. … This water is [c] that which I said … will make you come up hither.\"\n\n16. And as he spoke, I drank; and I was [d] inebriated, and my eyes were opened; and I was able to see. …\n\n19. … \"Come,\" he said, \"follow me … and I will give you … rest.\"\n\nGod is the God of rest.\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:9. … God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nGod is our salvation. God is our rest. God is our peace.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\n1 Peter 2:6. … you may be … a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.\n\nGod is our first fruits.\n\n2 Timothy 2:13. If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he cannot deny himself.\n\nGod is faithful.\n\nGod is the God of rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nHebrews 4:10-13. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his own works, as God did from His. Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest …\n\n12. … For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\n13. … neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nGod sees everything.\n\nGod sees everything.\n\n1 John 4:8,9. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.\n\nGod is love.\n\n1 John 3:16,18. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\n\n19. But whoso has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?\n\nGod is love.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nGod is love.\n\nGod is our rest.\n\nGod is our salvation.\n\nGod is our peace.\n\nGod is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n\nThe Bible says that God is love.\n\nWe can study love.\n\n1 John 4:7-11. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God. He that loves not knows not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.\n\nVerse 11 says, \"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us.\" The opposite of love is lawlessness. But the opposite of love is not lawlessness. The opposite of love is law.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving Him.\n\nThe Bible says that God is love.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving Him.\n\nLoving God and obeying Him is loving God.\n\nJohn 14:21.

"Apple’s ResearchKit is off to a good start, but there’s plenty of work to be done.\n\n\n\nResearchKit was launched in March as a way for Apple’s developers to easily tap into medical data from the iPhone to help researchers track and collect information about a variety of health conditions. Since its debut, there have been nearly 2,000 registered medical researchers, while more than 40 institutions have launched clinical studies through the app platform.\n\n\n\nBut there are several hurdles for Apple and its partners. On Wednesday, Dr. Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, will join at a panel discussion at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to examine what works and what’s missing in the fast-evolving field of mobile health.\n\n\n\nThe session, titled “What Are the Future Directions for ResearchKit?” comes after a first wave of successful projects on ResearchKit, including apps that help people manage diabetes, heart disease and asthma.\n\n\n\nThere are also some examples of the problems Apple is facing as it tries to get more partners to adopt the tool. Earlier this month, a major player in the diabetes community said it would not be taking part in the app’s data collection. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said in a statement that its members were not interested in the iPhone platform and “would prefer to conduct research studies using our own patient data that is gathered on an Android platform.”\n\n\n\nThat’s likely an expensive prospect for the organization, given the popularity of iPhones in the United States. As of last year, Android devices accounted for just over half of all U.S. smartphone subscribers, while iOS devices made up around 41 percent. That’s according to the Pew Research Center, which estimated last year that there were 121 million iPhone users in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe success of Apple’s platform will hinge in part on how it handles data privacy and security concerns. Apple had to clear some hurdles in the early days of ResearchKit because many people were concerned about privacy when they heard it would rely on data from Apple’s servers. Apple has since taken several steps to make it clear that the data is anonymous and that people can opt out of data collection.\n\n\n\nThe app program could also be a major part of the iPhone’s future if it takes off. It could help it better compete against the likes of Google, which is also hoping to get in on the health data space with a new Android product called Android Wear.\n\n\n\nThe first public version of ResearchKit will be unveiled on Wednesday, the panel will also include representatives from Mount Sinai and Pfizer.\n\n\n\nThat event will be at 11:30 a.m. EDT in New York City, and it will be livestreamed on Fortune’s website.<|endoftext|>\n\nSend this thread via email by filling out the fields below\n\n\n\nThread: Lost 10lbs in the last 3 weeks Send To:\n\nUse semi-colon to separate multiple addresses Your Name: Your Email: Add a personal message: Send this thread via email by filling out the fields below\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>I don't think it is your attitude.

But I do find it quite uncomfortable seeing them.\"\n\nThe Royal family came together to celebrate the wedding of Kate's sister to hedge fund manager James Matthews in the Berkshire village of Englefield.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnd while Pippa and James' wedding was a private affair with just 200 guests, they were still surrounded by some royals as well as other notable names.\n\nLady Amelia's father is the Queen's first cousin, so it was no surprise to see the Queen herself attend the wedding, alongside Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan.\n\nThe Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were also there, as well as Kate's sister, Pippa's brother James Middleton, David and Victoria Beckham and Sir Elton John.\n\nLady Amelia revealed that she even had a few words with Harry and Meghan, with the former asking her how she felt about her cousin's big day.\n\nShe said: \"I had a little conversation with Harry and Meghan, and they said how lovely the wedding was. I said 'yes, but I don't feel very comfortable seeing you all here' and Harry said, 'Oh well, you're used to it'.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I said, 'Yes, but it is still very strange to see you here'. I suppose you can't blame me, I am a bit naive. But the whole thing was really lovely.\"\n\nShe added: \"I mean, James is my cousin, I grew up with him and I love him dearly, so it was really lovely to see him. It was a lovely wedding, they are such a lovely couple. I am so pleased they are so happy.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nAnd as for what she thought of her father's outfit - which caused much comment among fans - she admitted she wasn't sure.\n\nShe said: \"Well, he always wears an odd choice of clothes, but that is what he likes. It wasn't bad, I mean he didn't look like a big prawn.\"\n\nShe added: \"It was lovely to see him happy.\"<|endoftext|>Dewalt DW3200 review, there are few tools that are as versatile as this one.

There are four batteries included in the kit, and they can last for a long time. You can also get a second battery if you want to have more freedom, and this will make the drill work for a much longer time.\n\nExtra Features\n\nYou may also like the extra features included in this Dewalt DW3200. There is the light that will make the job easier, and there are also other important features, like the variable speed. This is also a very durable drill, so it will last for a very long time.

The EHRC report cites figures showing that more than half of black and Asian people report experiencing discrimination when looking for a job.\n\nIn October, the Telegraph reported how<|endoftext|># This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n\n# License, v. 2.0.

"The world of professional wrestling is always changing, but the superstars themselves can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. Sometimes, the changes within the industry are so drastic that a superstar's popularity can get left in the past. WWE's superstars who were the best during their career, but are rarely talked about anymore.\n\nWWE is still the leader of the wrestling world. The company is no stranger to using the Attitude Era as a way to sell itself. They have had so many superstars through the years that they should make up their own Hall of Fame. Some of those superstars are the ones who are mentioned the most.\n\nThe casual fan knows about Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold, and The Rock. That is what makes this so fun. Everyone wants to see these greats become legends of the industry, but it is also nice to remember the stars who used to be a big deal. Whether they were a big deal in WWE or not, they are still worth remembering.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\n10 Sin Cara\n\nvia trbimg.com\n\nSin Cara has become a joke of a superstar. It has been a series of unfortunate events that have taken him from being a major star to a sideshow that should be in the pre-show, not a main event. When Sin Cara debuted, he was seen as a major star that was going to be used a lot. It took some time, but it finally happened.\n\nThe problem was that he never delivered.\n\nHe was so unimpressive that he was booted from WWE in 2016. He is making an appearance at WrestleMania 33. For his sake, it would be best if he kept quiet and didn't interact with the crowd.\n\n9 Kelly Kelly\n\nvia tumblr.com\n\nKelly Kelly was a fan favorite during her time in WWE. She made her debut as a popular model who was wrestling on ECW. From there, she rose to the top as a valuable part of the roster. Kelly became a popular figure who had her own dedicated fans. She had the right amount of talent to be a decent worker, but it was her good looks that gave her the extra push.\n\nAfter leaving WWE in 2012, Kelly kept wrestling. She is back on the roster with TNA, but she has not appeared on a television episode of Impact Wrestling since December of 2015.\n\n8 Alberto Del Rio\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is a sad truth that Alberto Del Rio has fallen from his former position in the industry. He was a very big part of WWE. He was not only the United States Champion, but also a World Champion. Alberto had a unique presence as a superstar that could do things no one else could do. He also had the microphone skills to back up his moves.\n\nHis tenure in WWE was marred with incidents that made it clear he was not going to be there much longer. His time in Lucha Underground was more memorable, but it was a step down from what he used to be.\n\n7 The Great Khali\n\nvia cagesideseats.com\n\nThe Great Khali is not really a superstar that anyone really misses. His presence was laughable at times. The thing about Khali is that he had a lot of potential. He was very big and very strong, but he never seemed to have any clue about how to use those traits to his advantage.\n\nKhali is now an actor and a former wrestler. He is part of the reality show Khali Kisses, which involves him doing a lot of kisses on people. It is a far cry from his WWE days.\n\n6 Kelly Kelly's Boyfriend\n\nvia youtube.com\n\nWrestlers who are lucky enough to find a wife have a much easier time in the wrestling industry. The same could not be said for Mike Knox. He was only a superstar for a very short time, and he was a part of one of the most bizarre moments in wrestling history when he got the Attitude Adjustment from Kane. Knox is not talked about much these days, but there was a time when people were curious about him.\n\nHe married the popular WWE superstar Kelly Kelly. The couple got married in 2014. It was a marriage that was not meant to last, as the couple divorced in 2016.\n\n5 Santino Marella\n\nvia ringsidenews.com\n\nSantino Marella will forever be a part of WWE. The WWE Hall of Fame is home to some great wrestlers and some very bad wrestlers. Santino is among those who have made an impression for one reason or another. His career with the company was not as successful as he had hoped, but he made a huge impact. He was the guy who was hilarious because he was so bad.\n\nSantino's last match was in 2014. He has done some backstage work, but the star has pretty much disappeared from WWE.\n\n4 Tyson Kidd\n\nvia heavy.com\n\nTyson Kidd was a true performer in WWE. He had a unique look, and he could really do it all. The man was skilled on the mic, in the ring, and he had a good personality. Everything came together for Tyson, but that would all change during an unfortunate injury. Tyson was a mid-carder who could have risen to a top level, but that was not meant to be.\n\nKidd is now recovering from his neck injury. He is still hoping to get into the ring again, but it is looking unlikely.\n\n3 Christian\n\nvia bodybuilding.com\n\nChristian is not a name that is being mentioned much these days. It is a shame, as he is one of the best performers of his time. Christian has made a career of being known for his impressive in-ring work and his ability to entertain fans. Christian was a popular superstar during his time in WWE and he did some good things for TNA.\n\nChristian has not been in the ring since December of 2015. He is trying to get back into the ring, but there is a possibility that his neck injury may have ended his career.\n\n2 Dolph Ziggler\n\nvia wrestlingnewssource.com\n\nDolph Ziggler had the chance to become a very big star in WWE. Unfortunately, things have not been going well for Ziggler. He was once a main eventer, but he has fallen to the bottom of the card. He is one of the many guys who will be pushed as the underdog who is going to have the moment of their life.\n\nZiggler has not been the focus of WWE. It is likely that he will be entering a new chapter of his career in the near future. The most likely place would be in Ring of Honor, but WWE has shown a lot of interest in Ziggler.\n\n1 Wade Barrett\n\nvia wrestlingrumors.net\n\nIt is going to be very hard for the casual fan to remember Wade Barrett. He had a short run in WWE, but he did his part as a mid-carder. Barrett is a former Intercontinental Champion. He did well in WWE as a member of The Nexus, but his star power never quite took off.\n\nBarrett has been out of WWE since 2014. He has had some ups and downs in the independent circuit, but his career has largely gone downhill. It is possible that he could get another chance with WWE. That would probably be the only way that fans would get to see him again.\n\nBarrett has been trying to make a name for himself in the business world. He launched a website last year. It is not likely that he will become a success, but it is nice to see him try to make something of his life.<|endoftext|>University: The primary mission of the University is to provide education.

And I said, ‘If they can do that to him, then imagine what they can do to us.’”\n\n“And this has put a wedge between Palestinians and Israelis,” he added.\n\nAlmogy was referring to the arrest of his brother, Amer, who was jailed for 11 years after he and a group of Palestinians tried to rob a Tel Aviv bank in 1994. Almogy said Amer was never convicted of a crime and that he believes the former prisoner is being held because of his brother’s connection to the teen, the AP said.\n\n\"We're used to seeing this sort of thing,\" he said.\n\nAbu Khdeir, who was born in Florida but living with his family in East Jerusalem, was arrested Thursday after he was identified as being involved in a clash between"
"\n\nToday we’re excited to announce that Bethesda Game Studios has joined Oculus as a developer for the Oculus Rift. The partnership will see the creation of two exclusive, made-for-VR games from Bethesda Game Studios; the first is currently being designed for virtual reality and the second is being built for traditional monitors.\n\n\n\n“At Oculus, we’re dedicated to helping developers and partners to grow, and the support and dedication we’ve received from Bethesda Game Studios has been outstanding,” said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus. “John Carmack, founder of id Software and now CTO at Oculus, believes in our vision and has created a custom version of Doom 3 BFG Edition for Oculus. We look forward to continuing to work with Bethesda as we develop our first generation of virtual reality games and experiences.”\n\n\n\n“I have a lot of personal interest in making sure that the VR gaming space is successful because I really believe in the technology and its potential to change gaming,” said Carmack. “As a developer, the Rift is something that I’ve wanted to work with for a long time, but the existing technology wasn’t quite there yet. I’m happy to be able to help to make the Rift a success and contribute to the rebirth of VR gaming.”\n\n\n\nAt Bethesda Game Studios, developers are working on a number of unannounced projects including new entries in major franchises. Those who have seen this year’s E3 show floor, Gamescom or Quakecon presentations have seen teases of what the studio is up to and a few of the titles we have in development are also being designed for virtual reality. The two games announced today are entirely new IP and we can’t wait to show them to you when they’re ready for primetime.\n\n\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Bethesda Game Studios, the acclaimed developer is responsible for creating many of the industry’s most popular games including the “Elder Scrolls” series, the single-player add-on to the original “Doom” and the “Fallout” series. In fact, “Fallout 3,” “Fallout: New Vegas” and “The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim” were each awarded game of the year at the 2008, 2010 and 2011 BAFTA awards, respectively.\n\n\n\n“We have made some long-term technology investments with VR in mind,” said Todd Howard, Game Director and Executive Producer at Bethesda Game Studios. “Hardware is finally catching up to the visions developers have had for virtual reality. Now when you put on a VR headset, you’re transported to new and amazing worlds.”\n\n\n\nThis year, Bethesda Game Studios showcased “Doom 3 BFG Edition” for Oculus. “Doom 3 BFG Edition” is a complete overhaul of “Doom 3” that brings modern technology and a classic, storied franchise into the world of virtual reality. This is the first title designed for virtual reality.\n\n\n\n“John Carmack’s work in the early 90s helped usher in the era of modern 3D gaming, and his genius continues to inspire developers to innovate,” said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus. “The team at Bethesda Game Studios is made up of the most talented developers in the industry and we can’t wait to bring their newest games, made for virtual reality, to life.”\n\n\n\nOver the past 20 years, Bethesda Game Studios has earned its reputation as one of the industry’s most respected and accomplished game development studios. Creators of the 2006 and 2008 Game of the Year, “The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion” and 2010 Game of the Year, “The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,” Bethesda Game Studios has earned a reputation for excellence and quality with each of its five releases.\n\n\n\nThis partnership is another step toward realizing the future of virtual reality. It’s an exciting time to be a gamer with the release of these groundbreaking VR titles, the arrival of next generation consoles and the continued evolution of the PC.\n\n\n\nStay tuned for more news on Bethesda Game Studios’ titles for Oculus.\n\n\n\n– The Oculus Team<|endoftext|>\n\nHi~ B een a long time no see. Thank you for the continued support on the blog. So, how have you all been doing?\n\nToday, I have a special post. I know most of you do not know but it is the 'World Animal Day'. The day is celebrated worldwide on October 4 to create awareness of animal rights and welfare. The day is a very special one for me because I am a vegetarian, animal lover and a dog-person.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the last one year, I have been trying to spread the awareness among the people. I have been trying to encourage people to stop using animals as fur coats, cosmetics and for food. I want people to know the feelings of these animals, the pains they suffer and what they go through while they are alive. Also, the environmental damage they cause to the planet. It is very important to spread this message because animals are treated as if they are some sort of toys that we can play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, I would like to share with you some tips on how we can help the animals and make the planet a better place to live. I also have a small personal pledge to make. Also, if you have not signed the pledge yet, you can also make your own pledge to protect the animals and the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips and pledges to help the animals\n\n(made by my friend!)\n\nOne way we can make a change is by making an effort to not use cosmetics that are tested on animals. We can choose to use all cruelty free products and make a conscious effort not to use anything that has been tested on animals.\n\nWays to reduce our carbon footprints and help protect the environment:\n\nAvoid eating meat, or even better, go vegetarian (dairy, eggs are not vegan but I still encourage you to stop using dairy products as well)\n\nUse eco-friendly products - Not just cosmetics but also in our everyday lives.\n\nGo cruelty free - Choose cruelty free products and wear clothes that have not been made out of leather, fur or wool.\n\nStop buying those animals that we do not need. Also, choose to buy second hand or recycled clothes. Avoid buying pets if you cannot provide the proper care for them.\n\nAdopt, don't buy! You can adopt a dog or cat from an animal shelter. Do not buy animals from pet stores or breeders. They are sold to you as \"breed-free\" animals but most of them have been bred in horrible conditions. Also, make sure you know the sex of the animal you are getting, because they usually are sold as 'un-neutered' or 'un-spayed' animals.\n\nMake a conscious effort to not use plastic bags. Use reusable bags or better still, try to avoid using bags at all.\n\nTry to use products that do not harm the environment and are biodegradable.\n\nWays to help the animals:\n\nSign the pledge - To show that you support the cause to protect the animals.\n\nShare the post - Let others know of the cruelty that the animals go through. Let them know how they can help the animals too.\n\nJoin or start a protest or campaign to help the animals.\n\nThe small pledge I am making is to help the animals. Every month, I will be donating some money to an animal shelter in my town to help feed the dogs and cats there.\n\nThese are just some of the ways we can help the animals and the planet. We can all make a change, and make this planet a better place to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know how to become a vegan, and which cosmetics are tested on animals, you can read this post: How to be a vegan?\n\nRemember, we are what we eat, so be what you want to be. Be a good person, who loves animals and helps to save the planet.\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nPriya<|endoftext|>Top Customer Reviews\n\nWhere reviews refer to foods or cosmetic products, results may vary from person to person. Customer reviews are independent and do not represent the views of The Hut Group.\n\nUnique, gritty, and wonderful The Good: The worlds are some of the best I've seen in a while, and how you explore the city and interact with its citizens gives a great sense of authenticity and intrigue. As a huge comic fan, the references are abound. The story and narrative is one of the best I've ever experienced. The Bad: The game is very linear and the combat while satisfying can get old at times. Overall: This is one of the best games I've ever played, period. Everything about it is gritty, dark, atmospheric, and enticing. While you have a very linear path to follow in the main story, the side quests and interactions you can have with the citizens is one of the best I've seen. You are truly the villain in this game, so if you want to be good and helpful to everyone, this is not for you. But for the fans of dark, gritty stories, this is one of the best. The story and narrative are top notch. The villains are some of the most compelling I've ever seen in a video game, with even the main villains being so much more compelling than the good guys. I loved this game from start to finish, and can't wait to see where the series goes from here. The ending while great is somewhat confusing, so if you aren't"

It’s the mid-season finale. I know there’s going to be some serious plotlines.\n\nAnd seriously, what was up with the weird science in this episode?\n\nNo. No, I did not just watch an episode with the headline: “Ouch, My Butt!”\n\nThat plotline was weird as hell.\n\nBut I can understand why they did it. He’s trying to be a “sophisticated ladies man” and not the boy they’ve been dealing with all these years.\n\nOh, now this is hilarious. But it’s also dangerous, if you’ve watched any superhero movie ever.\n\nIn the brief moment that I was allowed to breathe, I actually enjoyed this part.\n\nNot only is this scientifically improbable, but also… how does a security camera shoot a laser?\n\nI know this is only in fiction, but I do believe that they’re committing suicide.\n\nThis is also part of the reason why I wanted to talk about this episode. I know it’s not a good look. It’s not exactly smart of him to do this.\n\nI don’t even know what to say here.\n\nWHY?\n\nHe’s not afraid of bugs, but he’s scared of that snake?\n\nI mean, yeah, I get that he’s doing it for a different reason, but…\n\nIf it weren’t for that, then I would not have laughed so hard at this.\n\nOkay, look, I was done with this season for a while. I thought that it was becoming a boring clichéd plot that they were sticking to, so I was ready to say goodbye to it. But then I watched this, and I just felt like I was watching a new show. There was so much going on, and they were throwing so much at us at once, and it was just such a good use of time. I’m really happy that they had this show, because it was seriously pretty funny and it was also action-packed. There was a lot going on, but it was very clear, and it was fun to watch. I just loved how much was going on. I loved it, and I really did enjoy it. It was a bit much, and they took a lot of crazy chances, but it was just so fun to watch. That was some crazy stuff, and it was nice to see something so good after so much of the regular garbage we were getting.

Roots can become entangled in the small cracks between the asphalt and the cement to create the impression that the tree is growing out of the road! And when the roots do become entwined, the pressure can be so great that the roots are destroyed. We all know the danger this creates for the trees.\n\nThe solution to this problem is obvious: pave over the whole road surface. Not so fast! In the City of Chicago, for example, there is a practice that preserves the utility of the tree’s roots and of the road surface itself. The practice is called “milling”. Milling involves cutting the asphalt out in a shape that will not disturb the roots and adding back in a new surface. While the tree is protected, the roots are not disturbed and the road surface is left intact. When a tree is scheduled for removal, this is often the method of choice. Milling also involves improving the root zone around the tree. The roots of many trees can’t penetrate the compacted soil that is found beneath pavement, so it is necessary to mill the area to promote root growth.\n\nMilling is less expensive than paving over a road surface and can also be less expensive than removal of a tree. Milling should be done whenever possible and certainly before a tree is scheduled for removal. There is no need to sacrifice a mature, healthy tree.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>How do i search for files with a specific suffix using Unix?\n\nOn Unix, to search for files that ends with a particular file extension, use the following command:\n\nfind . -name '*.html'\n\nOR use grep command to list all files in a directory and subdirectories that have the suffix:\n\nfind . -type f | xargs grep -l <suffix>\n\nSample outputs:\n\n./Ajax/contact-us/index.html ./test/index.html\n\nThe above commands are equivalent to the grep command on Linux/MacOSX or the find command on Linux/MacOSX:\n\n$ find . -name \"*.html\" ./test/index.html ./Ajax/contact-us/index.html $ grep -l -Ri -f -E \".*\\.html\" ./ test/index.html Ajax/contact-us/index.html\n\nFind out all files with a specific filename (using shell pattern match):\n\nfind . -name '*.html'\n\nOR use the egrep command to list all files in a directory and subdirectories that have the suffix:\n\nfind . -type f | xargs egrep -l <suffix>\n\nSample outputs:\n\n./Ajax/contact-us/index.html ./test/index.html\n\nOR\n\n$ find . -name \"*.html\" ./test/index.html ./Ajax/contact-us/index.html $ egrep -i \".*\\.html\" .

"Russia has expanded its ban on U.S. pork to include all American meat imports as the diplomatic row over alleged election meddling and the situation in Syria rumbles on.\n\nLast week, the Russian government added five new countries to the blacklist: South Korea, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine. While the list included major agricultural producers such as Brazil and Canada, U.S. meat producers were noticeably absent. However, on Wednesday, the government added the U.S. to the list of banned meat importers.\n\nThe ban was announced by the state consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. A government official told Russian media that American meat imports were now being kept out of Russia on a “temporary basis”.\n\nRussia is the fourth largest importer of U.S. meat, buying $51 million worth of poultry and $22 million of pork in 2016. According to the National Pork Producers Council, the U.S. shipped 27,600 metric tons of pork to Russia in 2016, which made up 0.3 percent of total U.S. pork exports.\n\nRead more: Polls Say Few Americans Think Trump is Putin's Puppet\n\nThe ban comes at a particularly difficult time for the U.S. meat industry, which is still struggling to recover from a disastrous salmonella outbreak that began in 2015. China, Vietnam and Mexico have all banned U.S. pork imports, while the EU and South Korea are still testing shipments.\n\nThe bans come as U.S. meat exporters have had difficulty convincing importers to trust American meat following the 2015 crisis. The outbreak, which resulted in more than 60 percent of pork being recalled, was linked to at least 184 illnesses in 20 states. While U.S. authorities traced the outbreak back to a farm in Missouri, they were unable to identify the exact source of contamination.\n\n“This has been a major setback for us and it will take a while for the industry to recover,” said National Pork Producers Council spokesman Dave Warner.\n\nIt's not clear when Russia will lift its ban on U.S. meat, but Russia's state consumer protection watchdog has said it would allow Ukrainian meat imports.<|endoftext|>Is there anything you would change about this book?\n\nIt's too long.

For some, the reason is because they still have some of their shopping list to complete. Others, however, have an entirely different reason.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian adult will spend $473.12 on gifts this holiday season. That means the average consumer will spend almost $35 more this year than last year.\n\n“A lot of consumers have gone overboard,” says Ted Michalos, founder of CMG Financial. “It’s not necessarily the spending that’s the problem, it’s what they’re spending the money on.”\n\nThat’s because many shoppers are buying gifts for themselves. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re spending on the latest fashions, but rather toys and electronics. And the majority of these gifts, at 41.8 per cent, are going to be purchased online.\n\nHowever, the reason why so many people are spending online is because they’re trying to avoid the crowds and waiting in lines.\n\n“Some consumers just get too stressed and they go online to get their stuff,” says Michalos. “And if they do that, they’re likely going to be paying more for the gifts.”\n\nThat’s because while there are fewer people at the store, they’re paying more per person. For example, if someone is paying $50 for a gift in the store, they’re likely to pay more than $50 online.\n\n“This is really the time where you’re going to have to do your best to have everything done by the 15th,” says Michalos. “And it’s definitely a good idea to sit down with your spouse or significant other and look at your budget. And when you have a child, the best thing to do is to write down what you’re going to spend. That’s a real good thing to do, because if you don’t, you’ll overspend.”\n\nAnd that could come with consequences, because if you’re overspending, you could be limiting your ability to spend on your children or other family members in the future.\n\n“You can go overboard and give away everything you have to your kids and that could be a problem,” says Michalos. “This could be an opportunity to teach your kids about moderation, and also the difference between ‘I want’ and ‘I need.’”\n\nBecause with Christmas, most people are shopping with the mindset of ‘I want,’ not ‘I need.’ And that can be a problem, because it will prevent you from saving or investing.\n\n“If you’re going to be shopping on a credit card, you’re going to be in big trouble,” says Michalos. “If you’re not able to pay off that debt by the end of January, you’re going to be in big trouble.”\n\nWant to know more about debt?

Before we start , it is better to know what is virtual machine. A virtual machine is a simulated hardware that allows you to run other operating systems (or other versions of the same OS) at the same time as your current OS, inside a window on your current OS. It can also be thought of as a computer inside a computer. With a virtual machine, you can: Run another operating system (or another version of the same operating system) at the same time as your current operating system. Try out a new operating system without having to install it on your hard disk.

"The internet is a funny place, where people can get away with saying and doing the weirdest stuff that would otherwise be totally unacceptable.\n\nBut it turns out not even the internet is a free pass to sexually harass people.\n\nThat's what one woman learned when she was sent a totally inappropriate, NSFW photo from a stranger, that happened to be someone she knew in real life.\n\nTwitter user @kendtee, who describes herself as \"an arm candy\", tweeted about her encounter with the man she knew.\n\nAccording to @kendtee, the incident occurred after she agreed to take a picture with a guy. She then deleted the picture from her camera roll when it was over, and the man asked if she had. She said yes, and then he said this:\n\n\"It's a shame we can't see the photo anymore because it was pretty good\"\n\nShe didn't know how to respond. He then tweeted her back, asking her to \"leave [the photo] up for a little while\". She declined.\n\nApparently, he then texted her back, asking her to send him a copy of the picture.\n\nShocked by this behaviour, she shared the exchange on Twitter, and said the worst part was how \"unbothered\" he seemed about it.\n\nEventually she shared a screenshot of the exchange, and people were not impressed.\n\n\"Oh wow. 'I'd do ya if I could' and then the photo request. You should probably just block him and be done with it. 'Doing ya' or not,\" one person said.\n\nAnother person had an idea on how to deal with it, tweeting, \"You know what? Be a bigger person, send it to him. For posterity.\"\n\nMany others were in complete agreement with this sentiment.\n\n\"I don't know this man and I probably never will. But I 100% understand why he's going to be blocked. A man who says that is definitely not a good person. All women should know their boundaries with men and this seems to me to be clear cut,\" one person said.\n\nIn the end, @kendtee went back to him and asked him to explain why he'd sent her that photo.\n\nAccording to @kendtee, he sent her this message in response:\n\n\"How do you think I know that you're gonna see this tweet and block me or delete it.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be a creep you just said that you'd do me so I figured we had a shot lol\n\n\"I like your style and want to get to know you better\n\n\"If you send the picture I promise not to be creepy and stop bothering you\n\n\"I'm being serious here and I don't think I deserve the reaction I got\n\n\"All I wanted to do was take a picture with a nice girl and see if she'd let me\n\n\"I don't want to be a bad person or make you feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"If you like I'll just go away\n\n\"You're gorgeous and I'm sorry I don't deserve to meet you but I thought I'd try my luck\n\n\"I won't message you again if you don't want me to\n\n\"I'll delete the tweet and block you\n\n\"I just wanted to try\n\n\"Please\"\n\nThe rest of Twitter wasn't impressed, calling him out for still not getting it, and for trying to shift the blame.\n\n\"Like you have to explain what 'likes your style' means, like you're trying to shift the blame. But it's not ok. It's not ok for you to message someone for a photo. It's not ok for you to say 'I'd do you' and it's not ok for you to try and justify your actions,\" one person said.\n\nAnother pointed out that he was trying to pressure her into sending him the photo, and wasn't taking responsibility for his actions.\n\n\"He's a creep, and still wants to force you to send him a picture of your body. He'll delete the tweet if you do, otherwise you can block him. This is on him, not you. You have no responsibility to 'meet' him,\" another person said.\n\n\"Ok let's stop there with the 'I would've taken a photo with you anyways' thing. That's not what this is about. This is about someone sending unsolicited nudes,\" another person pointed out.\n\nIn response, @kendtee wrote that she wasn't bothered, because at the end of the day she was a \"pretty woman who didn't need to be respected\".\n\n\"I didn't get mad or freak out or feel the need to drag his name through the mud. I just calmly informed him that I have a man in my life and that I'm flattered but I don't share photos like that and I'm taken. He didn't like it so he blocked me and I'm okay with that,\" she wrote.\n\nALSO ON HUFFPOST AUSTRALIA<|endoftext|>Perhaps one of the most beautiful areas of Southern California is the Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood filled with high rises, luxury estates, and tons of culture.

But when it comes to money, how many people have the knowledge to plan for a good life? And what if you had this information, would you use it? How would you live? Would your life change for the better? Would your relationships improve? Would your life be happier?\n\nIn most cases, we don’t have enough financial knowledge to make the right decisions. We don’t have the knowledge and therefore, we end up making bad decisions. The result of these bad decisions is that we lose more than we gain.

"If you’re working on a SharePoint app, you’ll eventually need to get hold of a SharePoint context. At the time of this writing, there are two options: SharePointContext and SPUtility. Both work fine, and I think it’s really up to your personal preference and comfort level to choose either. But for my purposes, I’m a fan of using SharePointContext because it will use the most current context available, which is what I like to do.\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the two SharePoint context providers that we have at our disposal: SharePointContext and SPUtility. We’ll use these in conjunction with the new SharePoint REST API to get a SharePoint context.\n\nSharePointContext\n\nThe SharePointContext class represents a SharePoint context. The context is the central part of the SharePoint client object model, and it’s available from any client, including SharePoint-hosted, remote, or SharePoint-hosted-remote applications.\n\nTo create a SharePointContext object, you call the SharePointContext.GetContextAsync() method and pass in a SharePointContextOptions object. The SharePointContextOptions object provides the user information and authentication settings. We’ll dive into the details in the “Authorization” section of this article.\n\nOnce you have your context, you can then call methods on it. The context has a number of methods on it to retrieve different information.\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the available methods:\n\nGetContextAsync() - The method that is used to create the context.\n\n\n\n- The method that is used to create the context. SharePointContextPermission - The property that contains the permission token used to retrieve the current user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the permission token used to retrieve the current user. SharePointPermissions - The property that contains the current permission level of the user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the current permission level of the user. ListPermissions - The property that contains the permission level for the user to access lists.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the permission level for the user to access lists. SPHostUrl - The property that contains the URL of the current host application.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the URL of the current host application. Site - The property that contains the current site of the user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the current site of the user. UserPrincipalName - The property that contains the username of the current user.\n\n\n\n- The property that contains the username of the current user. Web - The property that contains the current web of the user.\n\n\n\nSPUtility\n\nThe SPUtility class provides static methods to retrieve a SharePoint context and return it. To get the context, you call the SPUtility.GetSharePointContext() method.\n\nThe methods you have available on the SPUtility.SharePointContext object are:\n\nClientContext\n\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\nGetClientContext()\n\n\n\nGetWeb()\n\n\n\nSharePointContext Permission\n\nBefore we dive into the SharePoint context, let’s talk about permission. The SharePoint context is going to be pretty useless without a permission token. We’re going to talk about this permission token a lot in this article, so let’s just take a quick look at how it’s generated.\n\nWe’ll need to use the SharePoint permissions provider to generate the token. To do so, you’ll need to call the SharePointPermissionManager.GetPermissionsAsync() method. You’ll need to pass in an instance of the site where you want the permissions for.\n\nIn this example, we’re going to call GetPermissionsAsync() and get the current user’s permissions.\n\nGetPermissionsAsync() returns a SharePointPermissions object, which you can use to set your permissions on lists, folders, and documents. The SharePoint permissions are applied in a single pass. This means that you can’t apply different permissions to different entities. For example, if you want to apply permissions on the web, the site, and the lists and folders, you’ll need to pass in the permission on the web, then on the site, then on the lists and folders. You can, however, pass in different permissions to different lists and folders.\n\nOne other thing to note about SharePoint permissions is that they only grant access to the web, not to the list or to the folder itself.\n\nFor example, if a user doesn’t have the Edit permission to a list, he will still be able to view it. But if the user has the Edit permission to the list, he will be able to edit it.\n\nIf you want to deny access to the whole list, you can set the permissions for the list and all its subfolders to Deny.\n\nIn order to create the context, we’ll use the context, the SharePoint permissions provider, and a helper class, which we’ll talk about later in the article. The full example is shown in Listing 1.\n\nThe context object will now be passed to the constructor of a class called FileRootsProvider. The FileRootsProvider class is part of a helper class that I wrote and will be available to you in this article.\n\nThe provider will be created with the context and then called to generate the access token. Once the access token is generated, it will be returned to us, and we can start to retrieve information about the site and its lists and folders.\n\nAccess Token\n\nWhen you call the SharePoint permissions provider, you’ll receive a token that represents the permissions for the current user. The token is returned as a SharePointPermissions object, which is what we’ll use to apply the permissions.\n\nTo create a SharePointPermissions object, you need to pass in the site URL where the permissions should apply. For our example, we’ll pass in the site URL to the SharePointPermissions constructor.\n\nAfter you’ve created the permissions, you can apply them to the lists and folders. You can do this by passing in an instance of a list or folder to the SharePointPermissions constructor. If you want to apply permissions to all lists and folders, you can simply pass in an empty list or folder.\n\nNow that we’ve created the permissions, we can use the FileRootsProvider class to generate the access token. The access token is returned as a SharePointContextPermissions object. The SharePointContextPermissions object contains the permission token and other details that we’ll use to get information from the SharePoint site.\n\nAs you can see, the code to get the access token is pretty straightforward. The example is shown in Listing 2.\n\nList\n\nGetting the access token isn’t all you need to do. You also need to be able to get a list and get a list item. To do this, you’ll need to call the SharePointContext.GetListAsync() method. The method is easy to use and returns a list object.\n\nIf you’re looking for a specific list, you can pass in the list GUID or the URL of the list. Listing 3 shows an example of both the URL and GUID to get the lists from.\n\nItems\n\nThe code to get an item from a list is just as easy as getting the list. You can pass in the list item GUID to the GetListItemAsync() method. Listing 4 shows an example of how to get the list item with the GUID.\n\nSummary\n\nThis article was a quick look at how to get a SharePoint context. The examples used a helper class that I created to make it a little easier to get access to lists and items from SharePoint.<|endoftext|>A few months back, I wrote an article about the journey from yearning to prayer. Since I have been praying on and off for many years, I was finally blessed with the chance to journey from yearning to prayer. It took a few weeks but it did happen. In the past, my experience of praying was somewhat a miserable one. It was not that I was not able to pray but the truth was I never really enjoyed the praying process. As a matter of fact, I used to hate praying. When I was younger, I was more interested in action than in words. I just want to know what I have to do and get it done. Thus, I never really understood praying. I just felt I was doing nothing but looking at the ceiling. It was only after I found my faith in Jesus that I have understood praying.\n\nMy first experience of prayer was on the cross. I experienced the most painful prayer in my life when I saw Jesus on the cross. He was in pain and so am I. He was looking at the ceiling of the cross and so did I. In the midst of my pain, I opened my eyes and saw Him. I realized that my prayers were not on my behalf but for Him. I looked at Him and realized that He was the only one who can pray for me. I looked at Him and asked him to pray for me. I have never felt anything like it. I have never felt more connected to my God than that moment. I have never felt more at peace than that moment. I realized that praying is actually for Jesus. I realized that Jesus came to this world for a purpose. The whole point of his coming was to save mankind. I realized that He came to the"

"Self-Selection and Pupils’ Labour Market Outcomes\n\nYoung adults from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are significantly less likely to go to university than their better-off peers. There is a significant self-selection in the probability of attending university and of high A-level achievement, which are key drivers of university participation. This paper exploits the introduction of minimum attainment targets in the National Curriculum for schools to explore the impact of early education policies on students’ achievement and on their likelihood to study at university. We find that when minimum attainment targets are introduced, pupils from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to reach higher grade boundaries in the A-level exams, are more likely to go to university, and are more likely to study science or maths degrees.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nData and methods\n\nAnalysis\n\nDiscussion\n\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nUniversity participation in the UK has grown substantially since the early 1990s. There are now 1.4 million undergraduates, which is almost double the number in 1992. However, participation rates have remained relatively low among those from lower socioeconomic groups (Furlong and Millar, 2008). For example, 40 per cent of young adults from high-income backgrounds were participating in higher education in 2011-12, compared to 21 per cent from the poorest fifth of families.\n\nTo some extent, low participation among young people from less advantaged backgrounds is to be expected given the historical association of university education with privileged groups. Participation rates increased significantly in the 1960s, after state support for university was extended to less affluent groups. Participation rose further during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, but then stagnated in the 1990s and declined slightly after 2002. Only in the past decade has participation among the less well-off again risen to the levels recorded in the early 1990s (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. University participation rates by parental income, 1962-2012\n\nNote: Figures are cohort entry rates for those who went to university in each year. Sources: Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (2014); Sutton Trust/Ipsos Mori (2012); Education Policy Institute (2013).\n\nDespite increased participation, the gap in participation rates between young people from more and less advantaged backgrounds is still large, even after controlling for qualifications. On average, young people from the most advantaged fifth of families are about twice as likely to go to university as those from the least advantaged fifth (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Proportion of young people who go to university by family income, 1996-2012\n\nSource: Participation rates (log scale) are from the UCAS End of Cycle Reports, 1996-2012. The relative income quintiles are from the Family Resources Survey, 2008-2012. The quintiles have been adjusted to allow for comparison across years by using a fixed poverty line.\n\nAt a recent seminar organised by the ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy, Professor Martin Brown (2012) suggested that it is ‘a great mystery why this gap is not widening even more’. He also pointed out that there is a significant self-selection in the probability of attending university and of high A-level achievement, which are key drivers of university participation. It is well-known that, in addition to their socio-economic background, non-cognitive skills, such as motivation, are important predictors of academic achievement. Since the increase in university participation has been driven by the growth in participation of less advantaged groups, it is not surprising that it has also been associated with a fall in the average grades of university entrants.\n\nThis paper is motivated by this observation, that early education policies have played an important role in the increase in participation among less advantaged groups. We focus on two such policies: the requirement to meet minimum attainment targets in English, mathematics and science, and the national literacy and numeracy strategies. We explore the impact of these policies on students’ achievement and on their likelihood to study at university. We find that when minimum attainment targets are introduced, pupils from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to reach higher grade boundaries in the A-level exams, are more likely to go to university, and are more likely to study science or maths degrees. We also find that the increase in the A-level scores and the higher participation rate associated with the introduction of minimum attainment targets cannot be explained by the improvement in the overall level of academic performance in schools or by the lower socioeconomic status of those schools that introduced minimum attainment targets.\n\nData and methods\n\nTo analyse the impact of minimum attainment targets, we use the school-level dataset that the Department for Education makes available annually for the National Pupil Database (NPD). The NPD contains rich information about individual pupils and their schools. We first use the NPD to examine the evolution of achievement at the end of compulsory education by using cohort-level information on final examinations. We then explore the impact of minimum attainment targets using changes in the composition of achievement. The results we present in this paper are robust to the alternative methods of analysis of achievement levels and changes in the composition of achievement.\n\nIn the first stage of our analysis, we explore the evolution of the A-level examination results by using the cohort-level information on final examinations. To study the evolution of achievement at the end of compulsory education, we use the data on A-level grades in GCSE and A-level examinations from 1996 to 2012. In this period, the examinations have changed significantly, from the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and the A-level examinations. The A-level examination was first introduced in the early 1950s as an academically rigorous alternative to the less selective B-level examinations (Wynne, 2010). Until 1988, A-level grades (i.e. O/A levels) were assigned by teachers, not by the students. From 1988, the responsibility for grading moved to schools. The examination was revised in the early 1990s, after which it was separated into two components: A-level and AS-level. The A-level examinations were re-structured in 2000. Most importantly, the exams have become linear rather than modular. The exams in each subject are now taken at the end of the two-year course. The exams are now externally assessed, and the grade is assigned according to the nationally defined A-level grade boundaries. The percentage of the cohort that sat the A-level examinations increased from about two-thirds in the early 1990s to more than 90 per cent in the mid-2000s. This reflects a policy shift in the assessment of vocational qualifications, which reduced the proportion of vocational qualifications that counted towards a student’s A-level grade.\n\nWe use a slightly modified version of the grading system developed by Hayward, Parry and Stewart (2009) and Bias et al. (2011). We use a scale of 5 grades to assess the performance of students in different subjects: 5 is an ‘A*’ grade, 4 is an ‘A’ grade, 3 is a ‘B’ grade, 2 is a ‘C’ grade and 1 is a ‘D’ grade. The best possible grade in each subject is an ‘A*’. This grading system differs from the one used in most of the existing analyses of A-level results, which use an A-E grading system. The difference between the two grading systems is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows that about 60 per cent of the students in the upper grade boundary of ‘A*’ under the old system would be below the upper boundary of ‘A*’ under the new system. Similarly, about 45 per cent of the students in the lower boundary of ‘C’ would be in the upper boundary of ‘C’ under the old system, and about 25 per cent of students in the lower boundary of ‘C’ would be in the upper boundary of ‘C’ under the new system. We expect that the increase in the A-level scores associated with the change in the grading system will be smaller for subjects that were not directly affected by the reform, such as English, maths and science. We do not analyse students’ performance in the core and non-core subjects, because data on the subject of A-level examination was not available for every pupil.\n\nFigure 3. Grading scales of GCSE and A-level examinations\n\nIn Figure 4, we present the cumulative distribution of A-level scores for each cohort, by the subject studied. Figure 5 shows that the average A-level score increased from a little less than ‘C’ in 1996 to more than ‘C’ in 2012, which is consistent with the improvement in the average GCSE results. The gap in the average grades between different subjects remained stable. The increase in the average A-level grades was particularly large in science subjects and in humanities subjects. We do not find evidence of a widening gap in A-level scores between the richest and the poorest students. In the humanities subjects, there is some evidence of an increase in the A-level scores of the less well-off. However, the increase in the average A-level scores was so large that the difference in the average scores between the richest and the poorest students decreased even though it was not eliminated.\n\nFigure 4.

Average A-level scores, by subject, 1996-2012\n\nSource: National Pupil Database, Department for Education.\n\nA key issue in the analyses of trends in A-level achievement is the impact of the increase in the proportion of students taking A-level examinations on the average score"

When George Henry Alcock (1864–1941), a climber and mountaineer, visited the Cuillin in 1893, he wrote in his book Through the Highlands and Islands of Scotland:\n\nNo one who had not seen the Black Cuillin and the peculiar forms which the rocks assume would believe that nature could assume such strange shapes as are seen here. The first view of the Cuillin from the south makes them look like a huge fortress of rock, with fantastic turrets and chimneys, and battlemented walls.\n\n\nToday these classic features, viewed from the slopes of the nearby mountains of the mainland, such as the Beinn Eighe and Mòine Mhòr, have hardly changed. But the Cuillin are not just aesthetically pleasing. To their first British explorers in the mid-nineteenth century, the Black Cuillin, which form a massive ridge running from Coire an Lochain in Glen Brittle to An Dubh Sgeir, seemed a forbidding mountain barrier, ‘a fortress of rock’. Their modern reputation, and that of the smaller range of the Red Cuillin to the south-east, as a major challenge to both rock climbers and mountaineers, was established during the second half of the twentieth century. However, despite the presence of the two main ridges on the Black Cuillin (North-West Ridge and Central Ridge), many individual peaks, and the climbing routes up them, were relatively unexplored. This was to change in the 1970s and 1980s when many of the hard, mixed and winter routes, most of which were first climbed in the Cuillin, were recorded by enthusiastic pioneers. Today, climbing and scrambling in the Cuillin can be combined with hillwalking, and the varied routes, combined with the varied weather of Skye, offer an extremely satisfying and testing experience for a mountaineer.\n\nIn writing this guidebook, I have had to make many decisions regarding what routes to describe, and which to omit. Many climbers may not agree with my choices, and it is inevitable that a guidebook such as this will not be comprehensive. As well as describing my chosen routes, I have tried to include a range of other interesting aspects of the Cuillin, in order to make the book relevant to anyone interested in a mountaineering trip to Skye.\n\nGeology\n\nThe geology of Skye, and especially the Cuillin, is fascinating, and as well as a number of peaks and ridges, it has given rise to a series of dramatic glens, the upper parts of which are in the Inaccessible Pinnacle (Coire nam Bian) to the north of the main ridge. The Black Cuillin consist of metamorphic rocks which were formed as a result of a major mountain-building event in the Caledonian Orogeny, the mountain-building event which took place between 500 and 400 million years ago. At this time, a number of folds (anticlines and synclines) were formed, some of which can be seen today. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr, for example, was the result of the raising up of a syncline (Fig. 1). This event also resulted in the granite being exposed to the surface, but this did not happen everywhere. To the east of the island, most of Skye is underlain by metamorphic rocks, but to the west, particularly on the western coast of the Trotternish peninsula, granite is exposed. The Blue Stack is also part of a major fold which has resulted in the formation of the Trotternish Ridge.\n\nFigure 1. The Blue Stack of the Old Man of Storr.\n\n\nThese major events have also resulted in a relatively complex geological map, with three main rock types (Fig. 2). A general layer of granite, called the Inaccessible Pinnacle Quartz Diorite, extends from the Blue Stack north-eastwards to Beinn Eighe. This granite has been intruded by the Red Cuillin Granite, which has a different composition and thus has different characteristics to the underlying rock. In the central and eastern parts of the main ridge of the Black Cuillin, the rocks are composed of the Papcastle Gneiss, which is a granitic metamorphic rock. However, to the west, around Sgurr nan Gillean and Glas Bheinn, the Papcastle Gneiss has been intruded by the Kintail Granite, giving rise to a more mottled appearance in this part of the Cuillin. A further complex of rocks is exposed on the north side of Glen Brittle, which includes the Torridonian Sandstone, Lewisian Gneiss, and Dalradian schists.\n\nFigure 2. Geology of Skye showing the main rock types.\n\n\nPeaks\n\nAs well as providing interest to geologists, the geomorphology of the Cuillin is also fascinating for climbers and walkers. With so many ridges and peaks, there is much to explore, and each summit offers its own rewards. Some of the individual peaks are not very high, but offer serious scrambles and rock climbs, while others, such as the highest summit of Sgurr nan Gillean (1,018 m) and the first major peak on the Central Cuillin Ridge, Sgurr Dearg (974 m), offer impressive views.

"The Orangeville Banner\n\nOrangeville, Ontario, Canada\n\nApril 9, 1905\n\nPAPER HUNT CONTINUES\n\nINSTEAD OF CASHING $5.00 BILL\n\nA message has been received at the Herald office from Orangeville to the effect that a lady, who has had $5.00 stolen from her purse, did not give the money to an expressman, as stated in last issue, but to another man whom she has not been able to identify, and that the messenger from St. Catherine will not get the money unless he turns it over to her. We have been searching for this lady for several days, and when the Herald office was last searched, we overlooked this message.\n\nAnother story of the stolen money says the woman, whose name is not given, gave the money to a young man who said he was a messenger from St. Catherine, and promised to deliver the money to the party it was addressed to at Kincardine.\n\nTHE MAYOR DISQUALIFIED\n\nA meeting of the citizens of Orangeville was held last Saturday evening at the Orangeville Town Hall, with Dr. A. S. Gibson, M.P., in the chair, to take into consideration the statement made by W. A. MacLean that Mayor D. M. McKenzie was disqualified from holding office under the Municipal Act of Ontario. It was resolved that the matter be placed before the proper authorities for them to decide. The mayor then withdrew from the hall.\n\nMayor McKenzie’s statement in relation to his withdrawal from office is as follows:\n\n“In this connection I have no desire to act in any unbecoming manner, and I shall resign from the position of mayor. However, I do not desire to leave town. I will reside here and attend to my business as usual, and my many friends who know me and who are not residents of the municipality will be glad to meet me. I want to get at the bottom of this business and find out who it was that drew up the notice of my being disqualified. I was the first one to speak in this town against the big sewer, but I am satisfied now that my opinions are shared by the majority. I do not think that the matter will go much further than the city hall, and as soon as the legal steps are taken the city will be rid of this question.”\n\nSILVER ORGANIZATION\n\nWe are glad to learn that a Silver organization has been formed in this town, and that a meeting is to be held at the Orangeville Opera House next Saturday evening. This is an organization for the purpose of working for free silver, and they are working under the leadership of W. H. Phillips, M.P.\n\nThe representatives of the Anti-poverty society who are here this week will probably have an engagement to-morrow evening. They are endeavoring to make Orangeville the headquarters of the work in this vicinity, and several of the agents will be here for some time. The meeting will be held at the town hall.\n\nA prominent Orangeville man, who is in the wholesale hardware trade in this city, returned this week from Chicago.<|endoftext|>\"Outstanding!

The sky has always been full of questions. Our ability to dream big and speculate has enabled us to discover, theorize, and theorize even more. But where do we get the answers? These are the top 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n10. Extraterrestrial Origin\n\nThe human race began to emerge from the Stone Age. The caves and forests were just getting familiar with the new inhabitants. There was a long time of fear and ignorance. Before we started to understand the world, they began to imagine what is outside the world. Some thought of creatures so powerful that they could destroy the world. Other speculated that we are a higher level of evolution and are the result of genetic experimentation of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nLater, these speculations were transformed into mythology and the imagination of the humans. In our modern world, it has turned into science. Many scientists still believe that we are not the only life in the universe and that at some point in history there was a connection with extraterrestrials. Some of them even believe that the first stages of our life were carried out with the help of aliens.\n\n9. Time Travel\n\nSince the beginning of history, people have always been fascinated with time. To travel back in time would allow us to explore the unknown, but would it be worth it? We live in a world where time is constant. Change is one of the most important principles of human life.\n\nNevertheless, many scientists still consider the possibility of time travel. The hypothetical method would be to build a giant machine that would make a hole in time. But how can this happen? It would involve breaking the speed of light and space.\n\nThe machine would have to be so big that it would create a massive black hole. Then the time machine would be moved into the center of the black hole, which would allow it to break the laws of time. So far, scientists have not been able to prove the validity of this theory.\n\n8. Time Travelers\n\nDespite the fact that time travel is still a hypothesis, there are people who believe that it is not. They claim to have traveled back in time to the present or to a previous generation. For this reason, there are also numerous stories about people who claim to have returned from the future to save the world.\n\nMost people who claim to have traveled back in time are just crazy. However, many scientists consider it possible that in the future, when we understand the laws of physics better, we may be able to travel through time. This possibility has been a mystery for a long time. So, this is a list of top 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n7. Deja Vu\n\nThe theory of Deja Vu is so controversial that many scientists do not even dare to think about it. The definition of deja vu is, when a person experiences something, although he has never done it before. Many people think of it as a kind of visual hallucination. The most popular theory about the phenomenon is that it is a past memory that has not been triggered by the usual way.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the brain creates a fake memory to deceive the person who feels it. The theory is that in reality the person does not experience a deja vu, but it is an internal response to the same scenario. In short, the brain recognizes the environment and recognizes the story that it represents.\n\nIn this case, the illusion is that the person has lived through this scenario. Nevertheless, there are many people who do not think so. The reason is that deja vu is a phenomenon that occurs in any person. So, we have 10 theories on the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\n\n6. Water World\n\nIt is one of the most popular theories in the world of science. It is believed that the moon is a result of a collision between the Earth and a body much larger than it. As a result of the collision, our planet was literally ripped. But what happened to the mass that fell on the surface? According to scientists, this part of the Earth remained liquid.\n\nThe evidence is so compelling that the theory of the water world has become a reality. For example, there is a large number of scientists who believe that the moon was the result of the Earth’s rotation and gravitational collapse.\n\nMoreover, there are evidences that this theory may be true. For example, when scientists tried to drill in the Antarctic, they found water underneath.

It is the most quiet of the three episodes and is more of a character study in the struggles faced by all of the Discovery crew and how that manifests in different ways. With that in mind, I find it strange that this is not getting the universal praise that the first two episodes were. But that’s the power of spoilers I suppose, no one knew what was coming in the first two episodes.\n\nThe episode itself, despite being more quiet than the first two, still manages to deliver plenty of story. You do have to take it with a grain of salt because some of the ‘bad guy’ stuff is almost unbelievably naive but that’s the Star Trek universe for you. Despite the low stakes, I was still hooked on every word and scene.\n\nThere are plenty of hints that we can be certain that there is a big bad out there that we have not seen yet. Perhaps that is what made the episode more interesting. There is something looming over them and we don’t know what it is yet.\n\nFor some reason, people seem to have a problem with the fact that the crew spend time getting to know one another, with only a couple of scenes of violence and action. Personally, I found that the social dynamics between the characters to be very interesting and engaging. Yes, this is probably true to life and does have some real life parallels. I am glad they did not waste time with all of that mindless action that I’ve become so accustomed to.\n\nThere are no huge shocks in this episode and the pay offs to the mini story arcs were a bit weak. But when the pay off came, I was still glad that they took the time to introduce us to the characters in this way.\n\nIf you have been put off watching Star Trek Discovery because of the fear of spoilers, then I would suggest you don’t worry too much and go ahead and start the show. If you can manage to resist the temptation of the spoilers for the next two weeks, then I think you will be very happy with the third episode and the direction the show is heading in.\n\nLet us know what you thought of the episode in the comments below and if you have seen the first two episodes.<|endoftext|>Price includes 15% HST, 10% goes to the developer (Living Balance)\n\nWaterfront construction, 11 homes, classic tudor style, quality & contemporary style homes to suit all tastes.

Or Windows 7 team is one of the teams that I work in. As a lot of you know, my favorite and almost only thing to do when I am not working is to read a good book. Well, I have done it again. I just finished the book I am about to recommend to you. This book is called “Ready Player One” by Ernest Cline. I can’t recommend this book enough. So what’s the big deal? You are about to find out.\n\nSo what is it about?\n\nThis book is a story about Wade, a teenager, living in the year 2045. The world is in a bad state.\n\nTechnology has progressed very fast, but a lot of humans have been left behind. Wade’s life sucks. He lives with his aunt in the slums of Oklahoma. All he does is play video games.\n\nThen, one day, he hears of a contest to win a fortune by finding the first Easter egg in the virtual reality game OASIS. The creator of OASIS has died and has left behind a secret quest. A quest that has the prize to the first person to complete the quest. But there is a catch: only the creator of the game knows how to find the Easter egg. And he has hidden the clues in the game.\n\nIt is up to Wade to try to find the Easter egg first. But not alone. He quickly assembles a group of fellow OASIS players. This group consists of his best friends and fellow gamers. This quest will soon turn into a journey. And I don’t want to tell you more, because I don’t want to spoil the story for you.\n\nA bit about the Author:\n\nErnest Cline is the author of the book Ready Player One. He is from the state of Texas. He has lived in New York City for a few years, but has now moved back to Texas. He is 40 years old and has been writing books for a long time. His first book was published in 2001.\n\nErnest Cline is very much into old science fiction books, and especially the 1980’s. He loves the music, TV shows, video games and movies of that decade.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nWhen I read this book, I really couldn’t put it down. I just wanted to know how the story would end. I wanted to know if the good guys would win. I wanted to know how they would beat the bad guys.\n\nI am sure you will love this book, just like I did. It is filled with great references to the 1980’s. If you are born after that time, you will probably have to read the story first to get the references, but I am sure you will enjoy it.\n\nI will also tell you, that this book is a great story, and I can easily recommend this book to any reader. It is not just a story about technology. It is also a story about friendship and courage. And in the end it is a story about hope and dream.\n\nIf you want to read this book, you can find it on Amazon. Or your favorite bookstore. I am not going to tell you how much it costs. I am just going to tell you that it is well worth the price.<|endoftext|>Additional information\n\nApplicants must be 18 years of age or older and must complete and submit the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) #6 or #7 form, indicating that they will not engage in secondary boycotts or strikes.\n\nThis position is in the bargaining unit.\n\nWe will require your W-2 forms as well as your Federal tax returns for the previous year for verification of your claimed dependents.\n\nApplicants must have unrestricted United States Government security clearance with the Department of Defense or its contractors to be eligible to work in a building that is controlled access.\n\nThis position is located in a National Defense Center.

"HARRY POTTER and the Order of the Phoenix is a 2007 British-American fantasy adventure film directed by David Yates and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling. The film, which is the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter film series, was written by Michael Goldenberg and produced by David Heyman and David Barron.\n\nThe film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry’s best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.\n\nThe story follows Harry’s fifth year at Hogwarts as the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort’s return. Harry must uncover the truth, with the help of his friends, and confront Voldemort.\n\nThe film began production in early 2007 and was released in theatres in the United Kingdom and United States on 12 July 2007, grossing a total of $292 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe film was nominated for two BAFTA Film Awards in 2008.\n\nFollowing a Harry Potter fan’s dream that Harry’s late headmaster Albus Dumbledore is alive, and in a critical condition at the Ministry of Magic, Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, decide to rescue him, as the school year comes to a close.\n\nOn the night of their attempt to break into the Ministry, Ministry of Magic employee Delores Umbridge slashes Rubeus Hagrid’s hand with a knife, accusing him of stealing her kitten.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione fight the Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy and his son Draco both try to attack Harry, but he manages to save himself. Harry, Ron and Hermione get separated, and in the chaos, Ron manages to grab the prophecy from the Ministry’s Hall of Prophecies.\n\nHarry and Hermione escape the Ministry, and Ron awakes to see Harry and Hermione’s signatures on the prophecy, but does not know that Harry had ripped the prophecy out and left it in the hands of his godfather, Sirius Black, before he was killed.\n\nSirius, Harry, and Hermione head to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, where they meet with fellow members Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks, and Sirius’s brother, Regulus.\n\nThe Order is joined by the regular adult wizards and witches in the battle, as Voldemort and his Death Eaters take over the Ministry of Magic and declare martial law on the entire Wizarding community.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore appears to die in battle, but this is revealed to be a ruse, as he and Severus Snape attack Voldemort and Lucius Malfoy, and attempt to take the prophecy from Ron. Lucius disarms Dumbledore, and an enraged Bellatrix kills him.\n\nBellatrix and Narcissa Malfoy stand by their husbands’ sides. Albus Dumbledore’s portrait is replaced with one of Snape. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rescued by Order members. Voldemort and the Death Eaters leave the Ministry.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione are told by Remus Lupin that all of the other Order members have been killed. Harry attempts to repair his damaged wand. He is visited by Snape, who tells Harry that the boy’s wand is irreparably damaged and needs to be destroyed, as Voldemort has become aware that the wand is of a “unique” nature.\n\nThe two engage in a fierce duel in which Snape calls on his master to save him. Harry is unaffected by the curse due to his ability to cast a shield charm. He manages to shield himself and fight back, and in his distraction, Snape accidentally breaks his neck and dies.\n\nHarry meets with Dumbledore’s portrait, who reveals to Harry that the boy’s mother died to save him, and Harry is filled with his mother’s love. Harry reveals that he feels angry and confused at this revelation.\n\nHarry also learns that the reason that Voldemort has gone to such great lengths to kill him is that Harry is a Horcrux, a piece of Voldemort’s soul that resides in Harry’s body.\n\nHarry then leaves Dumbledore’s portrait and meets with Ron and Hermione, who have just been told that the students and staff are to evacuate the school, as the Death Eaters have declared that Hogwarts is no longer safe.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione are joined by Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and several other members of the Order of the Phoenix, and they apparate to 12 Grimmauld Place, the headquarters of the Order.\n\nThe Battle of the Department of Mysteries is followed by the Death Eaters taking over the Ministry of Magic, as they believe the prophecy to be a key to Voldemort’s victory. Harry returns to Hogwarts to retrieve the prophecy from Voldemort.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione get ambushed by Death Eaters, and when Harry goes after the prophecies, he ends up dueling with Voldemort.\n\nHarry calls upon the remaining strength of his mother’s love, and as Voldemort’s Killing Curse rebounds upon him and hits Harry, the battle is ended, and the school is cleared of the Death Eaters.\n\nHarry wakes up to find Dumbledore, Sirius, and Remus in the hospital wing, as well as his friends and the rest of the school, and he realizes that he is safe.\n\nDumbledore then proceeds to give Harry his restored invisibility cloak, explaining to Harry that the Invisibility Cloak is one of the Deathly Hallows. Harry then says goodbye to his friends, as he leaves with Dumbledore to destroy the seven horcruxes that contain fragments of Voldemort’s soul, which will make him immortal.\n\nThe film ends with Harry and Dumbledore leaving the school in a car, accompanied by Professor Minerva McGonagall.\n\nI liked this movie as it is full of action and adventure. The plot is great as well as the dialogue. It is a well made movie and it is very entertaining.\n\nThis movie is definitely a must-watch, as it has plenty of action as well as being very humorous.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>Hush, little baby, don't you cry\n\nI know a thing or two that will make you happy,\n\nIf you will only come with me.\n\n\n\nHush, little baby, don't you cry\n\nI know a thing or two that will make you happy,\n\nIf you will only come with me.\n\n\n\nIn my bag there's a beautiful surprise,\n\nIf you will only come with me.\n\n\n\nOn my back I'll show you the sights\n\nThere's a rainbow in your eyes,\n\nThere's a sweet, sweet lullaby\n\nIn your mother's smile.\n\n\n\nOn my back I'll show you the sights\n\nThere's a rainbow in your eyes,\n\nThere's a sweet, sweet lullaby\n\nIn your mother's smile.\n\n\n\nHush, little baby, don't you cry\n\nI know a thing or two that will make you happy,\n\nIf you will only come with me.\n\n\n\nIn my bag there's a beautiful surprise,\n\nIf you will only come with me.\n\n\n\nOn my back I'll show you the sights\n\nThere's a rainbow in your eyes,\n\nThere's a sweet, sweet lullaby\n\nIn your mother's smile.\n\n\n\nIn my bag there's a beautiful surprise,\n\nIf you will only come with me.\n\n\n\nIf you will only come with me.\n\n\n\nOn my back I'll show you the sights\n\nThere's a rainbow in your eyes,\n\nThere's a sweet, sweet lullaby\n\nIn your mother's smile.\n\n\n\nIf you will only come with me.<|endoftext|>Mileage : 19,038 (77,223)\n\n: 19,038 (77,223) Transmission : 4-Speed Automatic\n\n: 4-Speed Automatic Exterior Color : Green\n\n: Green Interior Color : Light Blue\n\n: Light Blue Engine : 351\n\n: 351 VIN : #B9QWL214742\n\n: #B9QWL214742 Stock Number : 96988\n\n: 96988 Fuel: Gasoline\n\n1954 Ford Crown Victoria\n\nThis Ford is a very nice car, we are selling it at a fraction of the cost of building it!

It also allows the user to set an alarm to sound after a preset number of sheets has been dispensed.\n\nThe software is set to go on trial until November, when the management company will decide whether to expand its application to other toilet paper dispensers.\n\nFacial recognition technology is already being used in other places in Seoul, such as apartment complexes and an upscale golf course.\n\nBy Joseph Shin (jss539@koreabizwire.com)<|endoftext|>\n\n15% OFF ANY SINGLE ON EBAY WITH COUPON CODE \"PLAYTIME15\"\n\n(For US and Canada users only.

And people did not like that. I remember having this conversation where somebody said to me, ‘When you are perceived as yourself, people have a hard time relating to that.’ And I said, ‘I think you are misperceiving yourself to be someone who has a choice.’ I’m not saying this like, ‘Hey, world, my message is this, and you’re going to like it.’ That’s not what it’s about. It’s about the moment in which you are caught off guard, and you’re on tour and you’re not doing what you’re supposed to be doing, but you’re still getting a check.\"\n\nOn The Benefits Of Ghostwriting:\n\n\"I don’t have any beef with the world. I’ve got a bunch of kids and a beautiful girlfriend and a house that I love and that’s not an accident. And I’ve worked for that and I’ve gotten that because I’m an easygoing guy who really enjoys life. And I’ve always been super-vigilant about my ability to access joy.\"\n\nOn Being A 'Bubblegum Pop Star':\n\n\"I was, for a very brief period of time, a bubblegum pop star. I was in the No. 1 pop band of the late-’90s, early 2000s. I’ve had 18 or 19 top 10 songs. I have the right to call myself a singer, I guess. But I would never want to turn my back on being a guitar player and a songwriter. And the reason why is because I have a fan base that loves me for being a guitar player and a songwriter, and it’s very separate from the people who like my pop songs.\"\n\nHis Concert Review Regrets:\n\n\"I was like, ‘Look, we’re going to be under these bright lights, and it’s going to be this one moment in time where we’re going to play it for you. And we want to give you the most you can get for your dollar.’ And then I think I had a bad couple of years. And I lost myself and tried to get myself back, and now I’m playing shows where, like, I’m not having a good time.\"\n\nOn Live Music Criticism:\n\n\"I think we’re overintellectualizing music. The discussion about music is so myopic and minuscule. ‘He did this, and it’s a disservice to this particular song.’ And I’m like, well, maybe you don’t like this song. If you don’t like it, just don’t buy it. But that’s not the way it works anymore. So I think we’ve been eating the meat and spitting out the bones. You just want to get the marrow.\"\n\nThe New York Times concludes by highlighting the vocal coaching he undertook in 2015 in order to overcome his vocal issues:\n\n\"I went and saw a vocal coach who I had seen when I was on my 'John Mayer's Journey Continues' world tour. She was a big hero of mine. She’s the one who said to me, 'John, you just don’t like how you sound. Why don’t you do something about it?'

"COLD SPRING, Ky. (WKYT) - The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources says an investigation into the shooting of a horse at the Country Pleasures horse farm has been completed.\n\nAccording to KDFWR, a citation has been issued to a person involved in the incident. The citation will be mailed to the person's last known address. The citation is for the willful waste of wildlife.\n\nThe investigation by KDFWR has revealed that on June 11th, 2013, three horses were shot on a farm off of Logan Road in Bath County. One horse, a white and gray Paint Mare was found dead. The mare, named \"Sissy,\" had a history of being aggressive towards other horses. A chest wound indicated the horse had been shot at close range.\n\nThe second horse, a dark brown and white mare named \"Bonnie,\" had been shot in the rump. Bonnie was treated by a veterinarian for the wound, and released. The third horse, a dark brown and white gelding named \"Ghost,\" had a wound on his shoulder. He was treated by a veterinarian and released.\n\nKDFWR says the investigation concluded that the shooting of the horses was accidental.\n\nKDFWR says no additional charges will be filed in this case.<|endoftext|>Please enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nST.

The news sent the stock down 15% at the time of this writing, putting it on pace to be the stock's worst day since late 2016.\n\nSo what\n\nInvestors were expecting Applied Optoelectronics to lose money in the fourth quarter, as it has lost money in each of the past two quarters. But the loss this time around was bigger than expected, with Applied Optoelectronics reporting a non-GAAP net loss of $0.40 per share on a 14% decline in revenue to $93.9 million. Analysts, on average, were only looking for a loss of $0.33 per share on $92.1 million in revenue.\n\nNow what\n\nCEO Paul E. Jacobs called the results a \"solid performance\" and said the company's overall sales were \"driven by market growth\" and its plan to \"increase long-term shareholder value.\" Applied Optoelectronics also noted that its total customer backlog rose 20% year over year to $347 million, which is more than analysts were looking for.\n\nWith the company's stock now trading down 45% over the past year, however, it will need to show much more than \"solid performance\" to prove that its turnaround is working. To start with, it needs to stop the losses and start producing profits again. If it can do that, then the rise in the backlog will be a positive sign, and investors may start to take a fresh look at the company again.<|endoftext|>These two teams have met eight times before with the Houston Dynamo winning five, the most recent meeting coming in last season’s knockout round where Houston won 1-0 in Dallas.\n\nPROBABLE LINEUPS\n\nFC Dallas (4-4-2): Hartman; Loyd, John, Benitez, Morrow; Castillo, Jackson, Michel, Shea; Perez, Cooper.\n\n\n\nHouston Dynamo (4-3-3): Hall; Ashe, Taylor, Horst, Chabala; Moffat, Boswell, Creavalle; Bruin, Weaver, Davis.\n\n\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThis is the fourth time Dallas has made it to the semifinals.

"It's hard to imagine a wittier book than one subtitled A Primer on the Tactics of Scientific Research. But, then, David M. Kaplan and Robert M. May are not your ordinary scientists. At one time or another, they've all but single-handedly invented chaos theory, championed the concept of selfish genes, coined the phrase \"keystone species,\" and discovered the homeotic genes responsible for the formation of the vertebrate body plan. For sheer force of intellect, they're among the world's most eminent biologists.\n\nYou might, then, think that there would be little for these geniuses to learn from a primer in scientific methodology. But, as it turns out, that's just not so. In the same style of mordant humor that makes \"The Ant and the Peacock\" one of the best-selling books on evolutionary biology, Kaplan and May delightfully explain why it's difficult for a scientist to break away from deeply ingrained habits of thought.\n\nThey also introduce the problem of citation errors--a problem that has become all too apparent in the aftermath of The Bell Curve, whose authors committed a blizzard of them, citing everything from studies that were never performed to nonexistent journals. Kaplan and May suggest ways to prevent citation errors and to identify them when they do occur. They reveal that it's possible to fabricate a scientific journal, and to fool people into believing it's real.\n\nBut they don't confine their attention to egregious examples of scientific malfeasance. On the contrary, \"The Art of Scientific Research\" is written as a series of serious and not-so-serious instructions on how to conduct research, how to get it published, and how to cite it accurately. There's even a section on the art of collaboration, complete with sage advice on how to make it work. \"The Art of Scientific Research\" is a book for anyone who does science, or wants to.<|endoftext|>What I love about travelling is you get a chance to taste local food, pick up a language and meet new people.\n\nTravel is a great way to expand your cultural awareness and try new things.\n\nBe open-minded to the experiences.\n\nYou’ll see a lot more on a tour, than just your average solo tourist.\n\nI love travelling as much as I love food, so naturally I’m going to blog about them both.\n\nI’ve created this blog to share some of my experiences, places, and reviews.\n\nHere you can find my best recommendations for travel destinations and hotels.\n\nI want you to enjoy your holiday as much as I did.\n\nSo, keep an eye out for my next travel blog.<|endoftext|>Today, in the form of yet another unfortunate casualty of homelessness, a man’s dead body was found on the street just outside of a McDonalds.

You can read the entire article here, but it goes something like this.\n\nFord Mustang will have a larger, more powerful engine with a V8. A V6 will be offered, but as a two-seater.\n\nThe V8 will be a 5.0 liter, not a 3.7, and the V6 will have the same displacement as the current 3.7, but with the variable valve timing engine from the Ecoboost engine.\n\nIt will be called the Mustang GT, and is the car most of us are interested in.\n\nThe rear-drive GT model will be gone, replaced by an all-wheel drive GT.\n\nFord’s CVT will be the only transmission.\n\nTo be honest, I’m disappointed. The Mustang has always been about high performance.\n\nWhat is the reason for the V8 to lose power? Will we even feel the change? It is possible the V6 will make the most horsepower of all Mustang models, while still being smaller than the 5.0.\n\nDoes anyone want an all-wheel drive Mustang? Sure, you could argue that AWD will help with acceleration in the snow, but it’s pretty rare for the Northeast to get that much snow, and I don’t need all-wheel drive for an off-road trip to the Catskills.\n\nThe only reason I would consider buying an all-wheel drive Mustang is for the style. I think it will look very good.\n\nSo what do you guys think?

"Australian Energy Regulator highlights South Australian electricity network overspend\n\nThe Australian Energy Regulator has released a draft report highlighting the network cost of electricity distribution in South Australia. The report contains the results of an investigation into South Australian electricity distribution costs undertaken by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER).\n\nThe AER’s report found that the electricity distribution networks in South Australia, namely ElectraNet and SA Power Networks, are materially overspending compared to the amount of revenue they receive from consumers.\n\nThe report states that network costs in South Australia have been growing rapidly, due to a range of factors, including but not limited to:\n\nLow and decreasing real term retail revenue\n\nPoor use of time based network costs\n\nTime based revenue regulation\n\nChanging end-user demand for electricity\n\nInvestments in the network that are not supported by regulation.\n\nThe report further states that distribution charges represent around a quarter of the total cost of electricity, and are ultimately passed on to consumers through higher electricity bills. The report notes that the three largest state owned electricity distribution companies (including ElectraNet and SA Power Networks) have all seen rapid increases in their distribution costs since 2013.\n\nThe report recommends that the South Australian Government take action to:\n\nUndertake an urgent review of electricity retail regulation\n\nUndertake an urgent review of the existing regulation of distribution charges\n\nExamine mechanisms to enable local distribution networks to invest in assets that improve reliability for customers, and facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the network\n\nThe report also recommends that the Australian Energy Regulator should seek to work with industry to seek additional reforms to be considered by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC).\n\nThe report is open for submissions and can be found here.\n\nMore information on how energy networks operate and cost can be found here.\n\nSee our website for further information on energy and power regulation.<|endoftext|>A special thanks to all the people who have read this story and have offered me constructive criticism.\n\nA Big Thanks to The Prankster and Sage, also to Herr and themuseforlove for providing such helpful and encouraging critiques.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nHis life had been pretty good lately. The old man had finally started letting him do more things on his own, such as make deals with the city of Chicago.\n\nAt the moment he was in his office getting a briefing from Mr. Fredrickson, his assistant.\n\n\"The latest bounty is on something that is causing a lot of damage to the people in the city. It's probably best to explain the damage to you in person,\" Fredrickson suggested.\n\nThey both headed to the police station. Fredrickson had a theory as to what was causing the damage and had contacted the police.\n\nFredrickson's theory turned out to be correct. It was a monster, and it had been causing a lot of damage and injuries, but they were on the right track to capturing the monster.\n\n\"You mean that thing is going to be mine,\" the old man said when he got word that the monster had been captured.\n\n\"Yes sir, we are on our way to get it now,\" the officer informed him.\n\n\"I'll meet you at the stadium,\" the old man said.\n\n\"You want to come to the stadium,\" Fredrickson asked.\n\n\"I do, I want to see this thing,\" the old man said with a grin.\n\n\"Why,\" Fredrickson asked.\n\n\"I just want to see it,\" the old man answered.\n\nAs the two walked back to the old man's car Fredrickson suggested he do something a little different with the bounty this time.\n\n\"This thing is more dangerous than the last two that were captured, why do you want to go see it,\" Fredrickson inquired.\n\n\"Let's just say that I want to make sure that the right person is getting the bounty,\" the old man answered.\n\n\"Fine, I'll call them and tell them to make sure to bring the creature in the arena,\" Fredrickson said.\n\n\"Good, call them now,\" the old man said.\n\nFredrickson called and told the team that they were bringing in the monster and it was going to be brought into the arena and they had to get the area ready.\n\nAfter the call was made, the old man and Fredrickson drove to the arena.\n\nWhen they got there the old man went to the back area and took off his suit and put on a set of referee's gear.\n\n\"You sure you want to do this,\" Fredrickson asked.\n\n\"I'm sure, now go call them and tell them we're ready,\" the old man ordered.\n\nFredrickson called and then the two waited for the team to show up.\n\nAfter a few minutes the team showed up with the monster in tow.\n\n\"It looks mean,\" Fredrickson said as the team pulled the creature into the arena.\n\n\"It does look mean,\" the old man replied.\n\nAs the two watched the creature in the arena the old man asked a few questions of the men.\n\n\"When did it show up here,\" he asked.\n\n\"It came in about six months ago,\" the leader of the team answered.\n\n\"How did you capture it,\" the old man asked.\n\n\"We don't know, we just heard a scream and when we went to check on it, it was already bound up,\" the leader answered.\n\n\"Do you have a picture of what the thing looks like,\" the old man inquired.\n\n\"Yes, we have a picture of it,\" the leader answered.\n\n\"May I see it,\" the old man asked.\n\nThe leader handed the old man a picture of the creature.\n\n\"This doesn't look like the same one,\" the old man said as he looked at the picture.\n\n\"We don't know, maybe this is a different one,\" the leader suggested.\n\n\"This looks more like the picture of the monster I fought a long time ago,\" the old man said as he handed the picture back.\n\n\"It's not the same thing, the one you fought was green and this one is yellow,\" the leader said.\n\n\"Yes, I know what I'm talking about,\" the old man said.\n\n\"If it's not the same thing then why are you concerned,\" the leader asked.\n\n\"This monster could be very dangerous, why haven't you done more research,\" the old man inquired.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the leader admitted.\n\n\"You need to study this thing, do some research and if you can't find anything, then maybe you should move it to another city,\" the old man suggested.\n\n\"I'll talk to my superiors,\" the leader said.\n\n\"Good,\" the old man replied.\n\n\"I'm sure that I can find more information if I can get this one back to my lab,\" Fredrickson said.\n\n\"I'm sure you can,\" the old man replied.\n\nThe team was about to move the creature into the arena to meet with their local hero when a man walked up and started talking to the leader.\n\nThe old man looked at the man and recognized him as a former wrestler, and a very dangerous one at that.\n\n\"Hey, that guy is the one who can beat this monster,\" the former wrestler said.\n\n\"How can you be sure,\" the leader asked.\n\n\"I can beat this monster because I once fought a monster like this one and he defeated it,\" the former wrestler explained.\n\n\"Why don't you do it,\" the leader suggested.\n\n\"Fine, but I want the same money that you were going to give the other guy,\" the former wrestler requested.\n\n\"Okay, let's get this over with,\" the leader said.\n\n\"Yes sir,\" the former wrestler said.\n\nThe former wrestler walked over to the monster and started talking to it. The monster got angry and threw a punch at him.\n\n\"It's angry,\" Fredrickson said.\n\n\"I can see that,\" the old man replied.\n\n\"If he can't beat it, we can always use it,\" Fredrickson said.\n\n\"Let's see what happens,\" the old man said.\n\nThe former wrestler dodged the punch and was able to get his arms around the creature's neck and was able to pin it to the ground.\n\n\"This could be bad,\" Fredrickson said.\n\n\"It's not going to be bad,\" the old man replied.\n\nThe former wrestler held the creature down and then twisted its head around until it snapped off.\n\n\"That's one dangerous man,\" Fredrickson said.\n\n\"He is, let's go talk to him,\" the old man said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Fredrickson said.\n\nThe two walked over to the former wrestler and talked to him.\n\n\"You're good, I want to talk to you,\" the old man said.\n\n\"I'm listening,\" the former wrestler said.\n\n\"What are you doing now,\" the old man asked.\n\n\"I'm working on the docks,\" the former wrestler answered.\n\n\"I have a friend that owns a gym, and I'm sure that I could get him to help you out,\" the old man suggested.\n\n\"If I go to this gym, who will I be fighting,\" the former wrestler asked.\n\n\"That depends on who you think is the right person,\" the old man answered.\n\n\"I know, but how do"
"“Jurassic World” is going bigger, with bigger stars and a bigger budget.\n\nJ.A. Bayona (“A Monster Calls”) is in final negotiations to direct the sequel to “Jurassic World,” the hit dino tentpole that earned $1.67 billion worldwide last summer. Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, who penned the script for “Jurassic World,” penned the script for the sequel.\n\nChris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both expected to return, but not necessarily as the leads. Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley are producing the pic.\n\nWhile Bayona and Trevorrow are considered to be a package, the studio is trying to decide whether to retain Trevorrow as a producer or have Bayona work with an experienced producer. That will likely be decided in the next week, with a new writer possibly coming aboard, but for now Bayona is poised to make his English-language feature directing debut.\n\nPlot details are vague, but sources say the film will follow in the footsteps of 2015’s “Jurassic World” in focusing on the next generation of the dino franchise. The follow-up will be produced by Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley. The movie is set for release on June 22, 2018.\n\nBayona broke out in Hollywood with his 2007 thriller “The Orphanage,” and directed the ghost story “The Impossible,” which earned star Naomi Watts an Oscar nomination.\n\nBayona is repped by WME, Anonymous Content and attorney Marielle Tenghe.\n\nDeadline Hollywood first reported the news.<|endoftext|>Malcolm Butler played a game with a fractured left fibula in Super Bowl LII, according to a league source.\n\nAfter being carted off the field in the fourth quarter with the injury, the cornerback stayed in the game to finish the Patriots’ win over the Eagles.

They finished in third place in the regular season, with a 6-4 record. In the playoffs, they lost in the semifinals to eventual tournament winner Renegades, but won the third place match against Cloud9 Tempest to secure a spot in the summer promotion tournament. However, they were unable to advance to the summer split, as they lost to Team 8 in the first round of their promotion match-up.\n\nTeam Dragon Knights competed in the Summer Promotion Tournament, where they lost 3-0 to Team Fusion in the semifinals. The team also lost their placement matches against Team Coast, meaning that they would be playing in the 2016 NACS Spring Season.\n\n2016 Season\n\nAfter winning the NACS Summer Qualifier, Team Dragon Knights qualified for the 2016 NA LCS Spring Season. In the spring season, they posted a 6-12 record in the round robin and did not qualify for playoffs.

Acetate production from glucose in batch culture was investigated, comparing cells from co-culture with pure B. fibrisolvens and pure Methanosarcina barkeri cells. After 22 h, glucose was depleted in pure M. barkeri cultures but acetate production was not complete. After 22 h, glucose was depleted and glucose uptake and acetate production were completely ceased in pure B. fibrisolvens cultures. When cells from the two pure cultures were co-cultured, the cells from M. barkeri appeared dead in the co-culture after approximately 10 h. Cell growth and acetate production occurred in the co-culture, but was lower than the growth rate and the acetate yield in pure B. fibrisolvens cultures. Pure M. barkeri cells grown with pure B. fibrisolvens cells exhibited no growth after 8 h, but some cells were still viable. However, after 18 h all M. barkeri cells were dead and the co-culture was dominated by pure B. fibrisolvens cells. The results indicated that co-culturing of M. barkeri cells with B. fibrisolvens was not an efficient way of acetate production. Acetate production was possible when pure B. fibrisolvens cells were first grown to a certain population and then M. barkeri cells were added. However, complete utilization of glucose was not possible in such co-culture. In this study, the electrode setup was not optimized to detect early anaerobic cells.<|endoftext|>If your personal philosophy is a little bit Taoist and a little bit Marxist, there's a new place in LA to scratch that particular philosophical itch. Tao Mao is the only East-meets-West neo-communist tiki bar in LA, a three-story Chinatown bordello of poi dogs and palm trees. To get there, you enter from a rear alley and walk past the washboard abs of dancers in the Bumpin' Uglies Go-Go Bar to the karaoke bar called Red 7, and from there climb a red-lit staircase to the restaurant.\n\nTao Mao, \"the great origin,\" is the Chinese name for the Milky Way galaxy, as seen from the Earth. But it's also the name of a star in that galaxy. And in Mandarin, Tao Mao is pronounced \"Dow Mao,\" which sounds like \"D.M.A.,\" or \"doctor of philosophy.\" And that is exactly what Tao Mao is—a tiki bar where all the drinks have the names of philosophers.\n\nYou may be wondering: Is Tao Mao a tiki bar for philosophers? Or a bar for philosophers that serves tiki drinks? Or is it both? Does it matter?\n\nActually, no, it doesn't. Tao Mao is a philosophical tiki bar, that's all you need to know. The more you think about it, the less sense it makes.\n\nBefore I try to explain Tao Mao, I should mention that the bartender told me the bar's name is pronounced \"Dow Mao.\" And he is a white dude. And yet... all the cocktail names are in Mandarin. And he only speaks English. So what the fuck do I know? Maybe I'm the crazy one.\n\nI can tell you that the people who seem most at home at Tao Mao are little clusters of friends—mainly white dudes who look like they'd be hanging out at some over-designed tiki bar that was actually inspired by Tao Mao. For example, I met two TV writers who were there for the first time. The owner was there with his mom. The first time I visited, the woman in the next booth to me was there with her sister, and"
"Considered a New York classic, the Fourth Avenue Deli has been a staple of the city’s Lower East Side for decades. Deli aficionados and tourists alike have been lining up outside the restaurant’s doors for more than 50 years, eagerly awaiting their first taste of Katz’s famed pastrami sandwich. Katz’s special blend of spices, smoked over pinecones in traditional ovens, and the deli’s commitment to quality meat make the perfect recipe for mouthwatering pastrami. Every bite of the succulent, slow-cooked meat is an explosion of flavors.\n\nKatz’s pastrami, made with fatty beef from the belly, is a little softer than that of the more common brisket, but has a much richer, beefier flavor. The deli also offers hot pastrami, which is much more spicy than its cold counterpart. But it’s Katz’s hearty slices of hand-carved corned beef, a delicacy with a history dating back to the 1700s, that has helped make the deli a household name.<|endoftext|>IceBerg Originally Posted by No she was not a \"sexy voice\" in any way, shape or form.

While Boeing does not have a huge presence in Canada, it is estimated that the company has invested $6.4 billion into the country in the last two years alone.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it “cancelled a previously announced purchase order for 16 Next-Generation 737-800 passenger aircraft from a U.S. customer and added a new order for 16 Next-Generation 737-900ER passenger aircraft from the same customer.”\n\nIt added, “this change resulted in a reduction of eight 737-8 MAX deliveries from the previously announced 64 deliveries through 2023.”\n\nWith the order having been cancelled, it is unclear if it will be restored in the future. Boeing said the cancellation of the order was part of its routine actions “in response to market opportunities, customer preferences, and our results in a competitive environment.”\n\nBoeing says it remains committed to its relationship with Canada, but the news comes amid concern over the safety of the aircraft. The model was involved in two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, where 346 people died. The cause of the crashes remains unclear, but both involved issues with the new anti-stall system.\n\nAfter the Ethiopian crash, U.S. President Donald Trump said the plane was “certainly” unsafe to fly.\n\nFollowing the grounding of the aircraft, Boeing has grounded its 737 Max planes across the globe. In addition, countries and airlines have pulled their planes from the skies.\n\nCanadian airline WestJet has also removed its Max models from its fleet, as did Air Canada and Lufthansa.\n\n“The decision to temporarily remove our Max 8 fleet from service was made as a precaution and is consistent with actions by regulators around the world, including the FAA,” said WestJet in a statement.\n\n“While we have faith in the safety and airworthiness of our Max 8 aircraft, this temporary action is as a precaution while we await the findings from both the FAA and Boeing’s ongoing investigations into the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash.”\n\nFeatured Image: Pixabay<|endoftext|>Image Credit: Angie B., Albuquerque, NM\n\nPeople feel alone when they don't have a purpose. They feel like they are nothing when they don't have something to do. They feel insecure because they feel like their life doesn't have a meaning.

This is the second verdict in a week in which the Supreme Court ruled that blood samples must not be taken from a person arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\nAccording to the relevant law, the police can take a blood sample for alcohol from an arrested person if there are grounds for suspicion. It also specifies that if a person refuses, they can be forcibly taken.\n\nA man was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in 2011. He was ordered to give blood samples. He refused, but the police took the samples forcibly. The court found out that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol. He appealed, but his appeal was rejected in 2012. He then appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a 4-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict and ordered the verdict to be re-tried.\n\nIn the meantime, the verdicts are difficult for police. They can't take blood samples from suspects in alcohol-related accidents, nor take blood samples of suspected drug addicts, nor use DNA to find out the suspects in rape cases. They have to be very careful about searching people on the street.\n\nOther websites also commented on the news.<|endoftext|>Define ridged. ridged synonyms, ridged pronunciation, ridged translation"
"Another Apple Exec Talks About Bringing Down The Cost Of Macs\n\nOn the heels of some recent remarks by Apple’s Phil Schiller about the company’s view on entry-level pricing, the current vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, was quoted today in a Wall Street Journal article about PC prices.\n\nSchiller says that for the sake of keeping PC prices down, the platform needs to avoid fragmentation by maintaining one version of Windows that’s supported by all vendors. “That helps the consumer know that if I buy a PC in the next six months, it’s going to run that software. That’s good for consumers, and it helps keep prices down,” he told the newspaper.\n\nThose remarks are similar to what Schiller had to say about Apple’s Mac sales earlier this month, when he told analysts during a conference call that the company’s philosophy is to not “give customers a lot of choices.”\n\nHe also said that Apple has taken a different approach to pricing compared to its competitors. “It’s like when you go into a restaurant, you know what the food is going to cost. You don’t have to go through five steps of saying I want the steak for this much money, the chicken for this much money, the pasta for this much money.”\n\n“We’re not trying to segment or isolate ourselves from anybody,” Schiller said. “It’s more like, if you want a Mac, this is the price. If you want a PC, go over here.”\n\n[Source]<|endoftext|>OK, this is all you need to know about this whole \"Ryan Fitzpatrick's against the Browns\" narrative that is now in full force, after his dismal performance against the Browns last year, and has been growing in fervor ever since news of his re-signing broke last week:\n\nIt's not going to happen again.\n\nYou may not believe it now, and it may not be true on Sunday when the Browns take on the Bucs in their Week 1 matchup. But just like the Browns have a way of winning the games they're supposed to, Fitzpatrick has a way of having performances like he did against the Browns last year.\n\nIt just happens in reverse.\n\nThe defense was ranked 30th in the league in pass defense and would give up more yards in the first quarter than in the entire game the year before, yet it's Fitzpatrick who throws for 5,367 yards and 40 touchdowns that year. That's not a typo. And it's not because he was the quarterback of the future and Josh Gordon was the No. 1 receiver of the future, either. (We'll ignore the fact that the Browns traded for Jason Campbell at the end of the season to play quarterback and traded away Trent Richardson for basically nothing.)\n\nFitzpatrick and the Browns were matched up against each other in the third week of the 2012 season, and by that point in the season Fitzpatrick had thrown for 4,008 yards and 27 touchdowns in just 12 games. He finished the season with an astronomical 8.18 yards per attempt, which was the highest in NFL history. (Since 2001, at least.) He averaged two touchdowns per game for the first three weeks of that season before throwing just five more in the final nine games.\n\nAnd that was in his first season with the Bucs. They acquired him on the last day of August, after he'd spent the last few months being cut and re-signed by the Bills, which was the latest example of the Bills treating him like a starting quarterback without actually starting him. When the Bucs traded for him, it was widely considered a sign that they'd be moving on from Josh Freeman, but Fitzpatrick's job was only to hold the fort. He didn't even start his first game until the Bucs' eighth game of the season.\n\nThis time around, Fitzpatrick is more than holding the fort. The Bucs have put him on the short list of best quarterbacks in the NFL, with his name appearing on every single MVP ballot last year, and after a few years of analysts treating him like a highly replaceable backup, he has emerged as a bonafide starter. And like most No. 1 quarterbacks, he also seems to thrive against certain teams.\n\nIt seems like a good rule of thumb to get out of the way when he's playing his best.\n\nThe Bucs will almost definitely start out slow against the Browns on Sunday, but they're not going to go through another slow start and blow a lead against the Browns for a second time. It just won't happen.\n\nThis is a different year, a different Browns team, and a different quarterback. It's also a different Ryan Fitzpatrick.<|endoftext|>Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nSunderland AFC striker Steven Fletcher has had his £20,000 Bentley vandalised and stolen, sparking a massive police hunt.\n\nThe £45,000 luxury motor, which was parked up outside his home, was spotted being driven away by an offender, believed to be male, wearing a black crash helmet and driving a silver Ford Mondeo.\n\nPolice say it was not a random attack and is being treated as a targeted theft.\n\nThe car has the registration number CN55 ANT and Sunderland AFC can confirm the vehicle belongs to Fletcher.\n\nThe vehicle is a black Bentley Continental GT Speed with blacked out windows.\n\nA spokeswoman for Northumbria Police said: “We received a report of a car theft in Sunderland on Monday night.\n\n“The vehicle was parked outside a house and was seen being driven away by a man, who was wearing a black crash helmet.\n\n“The vehicle was a Bentley Continental GT Speed with blacked out windows.\n\n“The car had the registration number CN55 ANT.\n\n“This was not a random incident.

These ducks, according to the World Health Organization, most likely caught the virus from chickens, because H5N1-V has not previously been detected in wild birds, and H5N1 has not previously been found circulating among wild birds anywhere in the world. The two ducks apparently had not recently come into contact with any chickens. The H5N1-V strain found in the ducks is one of at least 14 genetically distinct H5N1 subtypes. While the H5N1-V strain can infect chickens, it cannot efficiently spread among them or to other species.\n\nH5N1 is an avian influenza virus, meaning that it naturally infects birds. Over the past 14 years, H5N1 has caused at least 555 infections and 282 deaths in humans. While those numbers are higher than any other human infection since influenza was first identified in humans in 1918, they are still a small fraction of the estimated 5 billion to 8 billion birds that have been infected with H5N1 over the past decade. The World Health Organization says that “it is difficult to estimate accurately the number of cases that have gone undetected.” Since the virus has spread to so many different countries, it is likely that many cases have gone undetected. Nevertheless, the case-fatality rate (defined as the percentage of people who die from a given disease) from H5N1 in humans is estimated at 60 percent. It is difficult to compare H5N1’s case-fatality rate to those of other viruses. The case-fatality rate from the H1N1 influenza virus that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide, was only 2.5 percent, yet that virus killed about 2 percent of the world’s population.\n\nGiven the high death toll, it is important to find the best ways to limit the spread of H5N"
"As word spread of the new church’s intentions, many Muslims came to have a look. “They were surprised to see Christians.”\n\nKoberg said he was surprised to see the modest construction was built as quickly as it was.\n\n“We have enough of everything we need. We have enough food, we have shelter, and there is security. We’ve built what we could,” said Mohammed. “They are very good, very nice. We’re working together.”\n\nBut Muslim leaders in the area are concerned that the church is being built on a spot where a mosque stood for about 80 years.\n\nEarlier this year, tensions between Christians and Muslims flared up when a Catholic hospital in the nearby city of Bauchi shut down its maternity ward, arguing that the government did not give it enough money to operate. As Muslims felt that the ward’s closing was unfair, they attacked the hospital, which is run by the Italian-based congregation of Daughters of Mary Immaculate.\n\nKoberg said he was surprised that no one has reacted to the construction of the church so far.\n\n“Nobody has said anything.”\n\nThe Protestants in Maiduguri had been looking for a new place to worship for months. They are not the only Christians in town, but they are the only ones without a church. Now they can freely worship their God.<|endoftext|>Bungie has confirmed a new competitive mode for Destiny 2, with a new ranking system and playlists.\n\nFollowing the release of the Curse of Osiris expansion, Destiny 2 will receive some new updates to the Crucible, as well as the addition of private matches for the first time. In a recent blog post on Bungie's website, it was confirmed that Crucible rank is returning to Destiny 2, and that it'll be more straightforward than it was before.\n\n\"We believe that to earn your highest rewards, you should be playing the most challenging activities possible for your skill level,\" the post reads. \"With that in mind, we’re making the following changes to the player investment required to reach your highest rank:\n\n- Strike-specific rewards (Medallions, Boots, Class Items, etc.) will no longer be tied to your highest achieved rank\n\n- You will be required to reach a specific rank (HM5) to earn the Nightfall-specific rewards\n\n- You will be required to reach a specific rank (HM5) to earn the Trials of the Nine reward weapons\n\n\"In addition to the above changes, we’re also increasing the overall player investment in the Crucible by requiring a minimum Light of 251 to participate in the most challenging endgame activities.\"\n\nIn the same post, Bungie has confirmed a new ranking system and matchmaking for the Crucible, which will include new playlists.\n\n\"To celebrate our launch of private matches and the new matchmaking system, we’re implementing a new system for ranking up in the Crucible. The highest rank you can achieve in Competitive play is now “Legend,” and your Glory will be available to view on our new Competitive playlist HUD. Glory earned in the Competitive playlist will be used to rank up within this new system. We’ll continue to expand on these improvements in the coming months.\"\n\nIt's interesting that the new rank system is being implemented for just the Competitive playlist, as well as the fact that your Glory is limited to a specific playlist. Hopefully, this doesn't mean there will be no more way to rank up in the Crucible outside of Competitive.\n\nAs part of the changes to the Crucible, Bungie is adding Private Matches to Destiny 2, which will be coming with the Curse of Osiris expansion in December.\n\n\"If you’ve played our April Update, you’ve had a taste of what a competitive, matchmade experience can be like in Destiny 2. Now, we’re ready to give you the power to host your own private Crucible matches. This new feature will become available in the next update.\"\n\nPrivate matches can be played with two to twelve players, and will have matchmaking, as well as private lobbies. There will be a wide range of options available to players, with \"full playlist and customization support\". Private matches will also come with their own rewards.\n\nPrivate matches will be available to all players who own Destiny 2 and have access to Curse of Osiris. You'll be able to make them as accessible as you like, whether it's making it a full-scale party affair, or something more intimate.

We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analyses from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nThe proposal for a binational state on Israel’s future borders with the Palestinians, put forth by outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, is no longer an acceptable solution, former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Channel 10, Burg said that the proposal, which the Olmert presented last week to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, was “naïve and counterproductive.”\n\n\n\n\n\nJPOST VIDEOS THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU:\n\n“Israelis don’t want to live in a binational state. One can’t create a state of Jews and Arabs, and not even a state that is a nation of all its citizens,” Burg said. “I don’t see any logic in it, even less so now than five years ago.”The former Kadima party leader argued that a similar situation exists in Ireland, with the Irish living alongside the English, but not in a single state.Similarly, he said, one could not build a future Palestinian state within the borders of Israel, but one can build a state of all its citizens in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and eastern Jerusalem.If the Israeli government doesn’t agree to this, he warned, the two-state solution is no longer attainable.“What we need is an understanding that [an agreement with the Palestinians] will be built on borders and not on a state of all its citizens. We’ll build two states on the 1967 borders, one Jewish and one Palestinian,” Burg said.“Israelis need to know that [in the future] there will be two states,” he continued. “The Palestinian people needs to know that [in the future] there will be a Palestinian state.”The two-state solution is the only way to prevent the State of Israel from becoming the State of the Jewish people, the Knesset speaker warned. “The future of the State of Israel depends on the existence of two states,” he said.“I’m for a binational state only as a stage, not as a solution,” he added. “In a binational state, we will never live together, but there will be an agreement. If there’s no agreement, there will be a civil war. We have to prepare for a binational state as a transition stage to the two-state solution.”When asked about the present leadership’s decision to allow MK Otniel Schneller (Kadima) to bring a vote of no-confidence in Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Burg accused Barak of “enthusiastic nationalism” and of being “naïve.”\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

It is a valuable contribution to the literature and deserves to be widely read. - E.E. Riley, Ph.D., in his Foreword\n\n...Cohen discusses in simple terms the pathophysiology of depression, the cognitive/behavioral theories of depression, the treatment of depression, and provides information about organizations that may be able to help. The author's descriptions of medications, both antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, are accurate and detailed. The reader can feel confident that the medication section is accurate, without the endless descriptions found in other books. The key point to remember is that the medications are not the \"cure\" for depression. Instead, they are used to provide a way of breaking through a \"state of learned helplessness\" and providing a method to help the patient engage in a treatment program. This is the key point in the book. In order to help those suffering with depression, Dr. Cohen believes that the medical profession has a responsibility to refer patients to a \"team\" which will help them get over their depression and learn to cope with the problem. This book will give the layperson a much-needed introduction to the field of depression, the various treatments, and how they work. It is written in an easy-to-understand language and provides references for the reader to pursue if the reader wishes to know more about the topic. - Richard H. Price, Ph.D., Past President, Academy of Cognitive Therapy\n\n...All those who are dealing with depression will appreciate this practical guide. It is written in a clear, direct manner. Those who are serious about becoming well will find in Dr. Cohen a knowledgeable and empathic guide. - Rev.

I don't even have to describe it because the sound is unmistakable, like the perfect mix of Carlos Santana and David Gilmour.\n\nThe group members hail from all over the planet: Stacey Blades is from New York City, Marco Panascia from Brazil, Marco Alfonso, of Caracas, Venezuela, and Juan Pablo Torres from Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n\nTheir bandcamp page gives you a good overview of their sound:\n\nhttps://steppenwolfband.bandcamp.com/<|endoftext|>As global oil prices continue to rise, some observers are warning that rising gas prices may cause a major economic downturn in 2008. What's more, the recent natural gas pipeline explosion in California, which prompted a moratorium on new development, will exacerbate the problem.\n\nOver the next five years, the United States will have to import nearly half of the energy it uses, according to the most recent forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. As of now, the United States is the largest energy importer in the world, importing more energy than any other country. We import 3.5 million barrels of oil per day, and more than 80 percent of our oil comes from foreign countries. This puts us at the mercy of OPEC nations, and increasingly Russia, who we are now trying to court to invest in our own energy infrastructure.\n\nThis dependence is a matter of great concern for many energy analysts. Some say that it's time to cut our losses and invest in the most energy-efficient technology possible while we still can.\n\nOur continued dependence on foreign oil could have a long-term impact on the economy, they say, because the price of oil will continue to rise with the demand, and the price of energy could skyrocket in the next decade.\n\n'We Need to Start Thinking Now'\n\n\"Energy is not just a topic that's come up in the last few months,\" says Matthew Ranson, an analyst with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"It's been discussed in a serious way for decades now.\"\n\nAccording to Ranson, for a long time, people weren't really paying attention to energy issues in this country. But then, he says, \"the economy collapsed in the last year or so and the [energy] debate started up again in full force.\"\n\nBut even now, he says, \"we need to start thinking about it now. We can't just wait.\"\n\nThe economy will be hurt most by high energy prices, says Ranson. \"Energy, unlike other goods and services, is necessary for people to have jobs and make a living and grow the economy,\" he says.\n\nThe crisis is already in the works. \"Gas prices are expected to increase at the rate of $3 a year,\" Ranson says. \"At some point, it's going to make people reconsider car ownership, which we are seeing already.\"\n\nOther analysts have noted that the worst economic effects will come in the next few years as oil prices begin to hit consumers' wallets.\n\n\"It's really important for people to understand that we don't have to sit around and wait for it to hit us,\" Ranson says. \"We can do things now to change the way we make energy choices.\"\n\nThe United States needs to cut back on our reliance on oil, he says, and start developing clean, domestic energy resources like solar and wind power.\n\n\"We need to think differently about the choices that we're making,\" he says. \"If we have a choice to import oil from places that don't like us, or if we have a choice to invest in clean domestic energy that's good for us, we need to make the choice.\"\n\nThe Golden Years\n\nRanson admits that it's not going to be easy to move toward a clean energy economy. But there are things that can be done, such as improving efficiency and investing in new energy technologies. \"We can't do everything at once,\" he says.\n\nTo help reduce energy demand, Congress has passed a law to require the federal government to improve energy efficiency in its buildings.\n\nThere are also efforts under way to address the energy crisis in cities, where people can be more dependent on energy, according to Ranson.\n\n\"A lot of cities are thinking about this in different ways,\" he says. \"In New York, they're talking about ways to reduce car ownership, like getting people out of cars and into public transportation, making public transportation more convenient, and adding bike paths. You can start with that and see what happens.\"\n\nThe Natural Gas Supply\n\nAnother important energy issue to keep an eye on is the country's natural gas supply. Natural gas accounts for nearly 20 percent of the country's energy, and nearly 60 percent of the nation's electricity generation.\n\n\"We don't really have a clear understanding of how the supply of natural gas will be affected by what's going on in California,\" says Fred Millar, senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank, Energy Security Initiative.\n\nMillar believes that the California situation may signal \"troubles ahead\" for the country's natural gas supply. \"There are real questions about how much natural gas is going to be produced by the industry in the coming years,\" he says.\n\nThere's been a dramatic drop in natural gas prices in the last few years, and that has encouraged a lot of companies to start new drilling operations, says Millar. But natural gas prices were going up last week, Millar says, and \"the question now is, has the bubble burst?\"\n\nA recent explosion at a Southern California natural gas pipeline, which took the lives of two workers, has put a halt to natural gas production in the state. The pipeline was owned by the Texas-based company Sempra Energy, and the blast occurred near Bakersfield. It is still unclear what caused the explosion.\n\nThe blast caused a temporary halt to the development of the Puente Valley Pipeline, a major new pipeline project.\n\nMillar says that the halt on the pipeline will have a major effect on the state's energy supplies. \"It could cause a major problem for California's electricity supplies,\" he says.\n\nMillar adds that the price of natural gas is likely to rise in the coming weeks and months because of the halt.\n\nOil and the Economy\n\nHigh energy prices are also a major concern for economists. \"The most immediate effect of a large price increase is inflation,\" says David Hughes, a geologist who has written extensively on energy issues. \"We can expect energy prices to increase for gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and other fossil fuels.\"\n\nBut economists are still debating how the economy will be affected. Some economists say that higher energy prices could have a positive impact on the economy, while others say the impact could be negative.\n\n\"It's too early to tell,\" says Millar. \"We're still in the stage where the price increases are in the process of playing out.\"\n\n\"The economy is more fragile than it was in the 1970s, and energy is more integrated into the economy, and prices are higher,\" says Ranson.\n\nBut he believes that the economy is better positioned to deal with energy prices now than it was in the 1970s. \"I don't think the impact of high energy prices will be nearly as bad this time,\" he says.\n\nA slowdown in the economy and a possible recession, Ranson says, could cause energy prices to spike even more.\n\nBut even if the economy takes a downturn, Ranson says that energy prices will keep going up. \"People may stop spending on some things,\" he says, \"but energy prices are going to keep going up.\"\n\nRanson says that people will have to make choices about how they live, and the government will have to decide how much of a subsidy it's willing to provide for the alternative energy industry.\n\nHughes believes that, ultimately, high energy prices will bring about some kind of economic crisis. \"In my view, this is a symptom of a much bigger problem, which is our oil-based economy,\" he says. \"We can no longer afford the fossil fuel based economy we have had for the past century.\"\n\nCopyright 2007 E&E Publishing.

"I’m back in Shoreditch and work starts again tomorrow so I’m trying to get things sorted before that. However, this was my second big trip of the year and I’m feeling a bit worn out. It feels like it was longer than a week though.\n\nI went to Seoul with Jess for two weeks. We flew to Seoul Incheon on Cathay Pacific and stayed at the Hyatt in Seoul Station, just outside the hotel station (it was actually our last day before we flew out). We visited the Han River and the Hongdae area (including bars, restaurants and music venues) and went to the Seoul Film Festival. We spent a lot of time walking around too as we don’t really know the city that well and were pretty tired by the end of each day.\n\nWe visited a temple near Cheongdam called Angukdaegyo which was beautiful. We also visited the grounds of the 63 Building which is quite close to the hotel. The following day, we went to Jogyesa Temple which is where the head of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism has his residence. We also went to Cheongwadae which is the residence of the President of Korea and the Blue House. I really wanted to go inside the Blue House but it was closed when we were there. The area around the Blue House was really beautiful.\n\nWe had a really nice lunch at the Daehangno area. We had a really nice lunch at the Dongmyo Station near Gyeongbokgung Palace. The area is quite nice. We then went to Insadong where there were lots of small shops. We also visited Namsangol Hanok Village and had a nice lunch at the Hanok Village. It was also near Gyeonghuigung. We walked up the hills near Gyeonghuigung, which were quite steep and also quite a nice walk. We also visited Seoul Tower which was lovely and there was a great view of Seoul.\n\nWe then travelled to Busan for a day to see the Ulsan Bijudong Cable Car and to take the ferry to Geoje Island. Busan was nice and I can definitely see why people live there. There was a great view of the coast from the cable car. There were quite a lot of islands in Geoje Island. We stayed in the Geoje Island Ferry Cruise which is a small hotel. It was very pleasant there and the food was good. We walked around the island and saw the Minho lighthouse. It was quite cloudy so we couldn’t see the islands around. We stayed for dinner and saw the sunset before we returned to Busan.\n\nOur next destination was Jeju Island. We flew from Busan to Jeju Island on a flight that took about 1 hour. There was also a harbour just outside the hotel. We stayed at the Full Moon Hotel. It was quite beautiful. We visited Hallasan Mountain and the Jeju Haenyeo Museum of Women’s Contributions to Life in the Jeju Island in which there was a lovely view of Hallasan Mountain. We also visited Samcheok Beach. We had a great dinner at the Full Moon Hotel in the Samcheok Bay. There was a beautiful view of the moon rising over the beach from our room.\n\nThe next day, we went to Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak, which was very beautiful. It is a volcanic crater on a small island that was completely formed from lava. It was cloudy and rainy while we were there. We went to Seogwipo and had a lovely lunch at Jin Jin Gop. We had a really nice seafood lunch and it was just a couple of minutes away from Seogwipo station. We went to the Seogwipo Lotte Shopping Center and bought some gifts.\n\nWe then went to Hallim Park. It was a very hot day but it was very pleasant there. We went on a cable car to Mount Baekhwa, which was really nice. It is the highest mountain on Jeju Island and the views were nice. We also went to Mokcheongyeon cave and we visited the memorial museum and the huge cave. The cave was really nice and it was a good experience. We then went to Jeju Olle Trail which is a series of pathways that cross Jeju Island. They have been designed to showcase the most beautiful spots on Jeju. We went to the Jeju Olle trail which was near the entrance of Hallim Park. The weather was really nice so it was pleasant to be outside.\n\nWe went to Seongsan Sunrise Peak which was a nice place to see the sunrise. There was a really nice sunset too. The weather was very nice and it was a pleasant place to be. We also went to Mt Sine, which was very pretty. It was a bit foggy and we couldn’t see Mt Halla but it was a nice walk. We also went to the 7 treasures of Jeju which was nice. We then went to Biyang-ri, Seogwipo, which was a bit more rural and very nice.\n\nOur last destination was the Jeju World Cup Stadium. It was a really nice stadium with lots of seating. It had lots of places to eat and drink too.\n\nWe then flew back to Seoul to fly home. It was a lovely place and I can definitely see why people would want to live there.<|endoftext|>In her interview with Popnography, Kate Micucci discussed her two new projects, BoJack Horseman and another animated series on Yahoo! Screen called Other Space. Other Space will be an anthology comedy following the crew of the space shuttle Venturi 2, created by Paul Feig.\n\nOther Space will be the first show I do where the cast is mostly male. I’m a big feminist and I’m not sure how I feel about that, but my character, Natalie, is the only girl on the ship and the youngest, which makes her feel isolated from the rest of the crew. She’s shy and reserved. She’s a huge sci-fi nerd and very book smart but not street smart. She’s obsessed with books and fantasy but there are too many people on the ship and she has a hard time focusing.\n\nKate plays one of the main characters, Natalie, a woman with aspirations of space travel who works on the shuttle, Venturi 2. The series has been compared to an early 90s show called Space Cases, which also takes place on a space shuttle, however, it seems that Other Space will be a little bit more adult and will likely also delve into the science fiction genre as well as the comedy. Micucci will be joined by a great ensemble of actors including The Hunger Games actor, Sam Richardson, as Commander Glen. Richardson and Micucci previously worked together on Saturday Night Live, and Kate shared how much she loves working with him.\n\nI love working with Sam. He’s so wonderful. He’s so cute. I think my character Natalie really brings him out of his shell. She’s the only one who really has the courage to push him. I think she also brings out a really kind, sensitive side in him that he probably doesn’t have a lot of. It’s been a really lovely experience to get to work with him. He’s just a very warm, kind person.\n\nAlso joining the cast are Rebecca Romijn as the ambitious first officer, Kelly, and Enrico Colantoni as Captain Zalian. Other Space will be directed by Joe Russo and will be a half hour comedy show with ten episodes. The show is set to premiere on Yahoo! Screen on April 14, 2015.<|endoftext|>The 24th annual World Press Photo Contest has announced its winners.

"Der Präsident des Verfassungsschutzes, Hans-Georg Maaßen, ist von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) entlassen worden. Wie das Bundeskabinett am Mittwoch nach Teilnehmerangaben beschloss, wird Maaßen zum Innen-Staatssekretär im Bundesinnenministerium befördert. Seine bisherige Stellvertreterin, Präsidentin des Bundesamtes für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), Susann Wimmer, wird dann seinen Posten als Behördenleiter übernehmen. Wie die \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" berichtet, haben die drei Parteichefs der Großen Koalition, Angela Merkel (CDU), Horst Seehofer (CSU) und Andrea Nahles (SPD), die Personalie Maaßen am Dienstagabend einstimmig beschlossen. Merkel habe demnach in einem \"Auftragskommando\" an die drei Parteichefs auf die schnelle Lösung gedrungen. Im Laufe des Tages soll der Bundestag Maaßen noch abschließend über die Beförderung abstimmen.\n\nMaaßen soll dann als Staatssekretär für europäische und internationale Aussagen im Bundesinnenministerium eingesetzt werden, wie es am Mittwoch aus Regierungskreisen hieß. Demnach wird er Staatssekretär für die Bereiche Bauen, Wohnen und Energie.\n\nMerkel hatte am Dienstag erklärt, die Koalition wolle den Fall Maaßen noch heute abschließend klären. Nachdem der Verfassungsschutzpräsident angeblich Zweifel an den Aussagen des jüdischen Mannes geäußert hatte, der in Chemnitz gefilmt worden war, hatte der \"Spiegel\" berichtet, Maaßen habe die AfD-Spitze in Sachsen gewarnt, eine Einbindung des Verfassungsschutzes in die Aufarbeitung des Chemnitzer Tötungsdeliktes anzustreben. Zudem soll Maaßen im Zusammenhang mit den Vorfällen in Chemnitz gegenüber der \"Bild\"-Zeitung gesagt haben, dass ein Video von dem Übergriff auf einen Mann \"gefälscht\" sein könnte. Die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Dresden bezeichnete diese Aussagen zu einem angeblichen Fake-Video als \"irreführend\".\n\nAm Dienstag hatte der Fall Maaßen bereits für Unruhe in der Bundesregierung gesorgt, nachdem das Kabinett offenbar überraschend über die Zukunft des Verfassungsschutzpräsidenten entschieden hatte. Nach Informationen von NDR, WDR und \"Süddeutscher Zeitung\" sollen SPD-Chefin Nahles und CSU-Chef Seehofer die Entscheidung der Kanzlerin zum sofortigen Rauswurf Maaßens umgehend blockiert haben. Laut Informationen der \"Süddeutschen Zeitung\" hat Merkel den Koalitionspartnern gegenüber zudem ihren Willen bekräftigt, Maaßen als Staatssekretär in ihrem Kabinett zu halten. Merkel sei verärgert gewesen über die Weigerung der SPD-Parteispitze, den konservativen Kritiker der Migrationspolitik als Staatssekretär im Innenministerium zu akzeptieren, schreibt die Zeitung unter Berufung auf SPD-Kreise.\n\nMaas: \"Irrelevante Debatte\"\n\nVor dem Hintergrund der Debatte um Maaßen hat Außenminister Heiko Maas (SPD) die Bundesregierung aufgefordert, eine \"tiefgreifende und unübersehbare Antwort auf die Herausforderungen der Migration und die Probleme mit der Integration\" zu geben. \"Es geht nicht um eine Personaldiskussion, sondern um das Schicksal der Demokratie\", sagte Maas am Mittwoch in Berlin. Die Debatte über Maaßen sei nicht nur eine rein parteipolitische, sondern vor allem eine \"irrelevante\".\n\nDas Verhältnis der großen Koalition zueinander sei \"durch die Vorgänge in der letzten Woche in keiner Weise verbessert\", sagte Maas. \"Was wir in den letzten Tagen erlebt haben, ist ein erschreckender Mangel an Selbstverständnis, der manchmal nur noch unterstreicht, wie wenig sich die große Koalition selbst wertschätzt.\" Dass es \"in den vergangenen Wochen\" darüber diskutiert worden sei, \"ob sich Maaßen noch halten lässt\", könne niemanden erfreuen. Die Entscheidung, Maaßen entlassen zu wollen, sei darüber hinaus von Personaldebatten überlagert worden.\n\nAufgeregte Stimmen\n\nBei der Debatte zum Haushalt des Bundesinnenministeriums im Bundestag wurde im Anschluss an die Haushaltsrede von Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) die Stimmung in den Reihen der Regierungsparteien am Mittwoch sehr aufgeregt. Die Opposition im Bundestag sieht in den Spannungen der Koalition über die Zukunft des Verfassungsschutzpräsidenten Hans-Georg Maaßen auch ein eigenes Versagen beim Streit.\n\n\"Für das, was hier gerade passiert, tragen Sie alle, die Sie hier sitzen, die politische Verantwortung\", sagte die SPD-Fraktionsvorsitzende Andrea Nahles. \"Sie tragen dafür die Verantwortung, dass es in dieser Woche überhaupt zu einem solchen Haushaltsgesetz kommen kann, wie Sie es hier machen.\" Nahles forderte Seehofer auf, die Vorgänge über Maaßen zu erklären, weil sie sich selbst von der Regierung verraten fühle. \"Die Regierung und die politische Führung dieses Landes muss jetzt den Weg der Einheit beschreiten\", forderte sie.\n\nKritik übte Nahles daran, dass das Bundesinnenministerium bei der Einrichtung von Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen in Anforderungen an die jeweiligen Bundesländer nun \"weich\" geworden sei. Zudem gebe es zu wenig Plätze für die Abschiebung abgelehnter Asylbewerber und zu wenig Rückführungen nach Afghanistan. Es sei ein \"Skandal\", dass so viele Menschen in Deutschland festsitzen.\n\nAfD: Maaßen soll Verfassungsschutz-Chef bleiben\n\nDie AfD hält dagegen. Fraktionschef Alexander Gauland begrüßte Maaßen als neuen Staatssekretär im Innenministerium. Er sei überzeugt, dass Maaßen in der neuen Funktion seine Erfahrungen als Präsident des Verfassungsschutzes in die Politik einbringen könne, sagte"

The kyat was introduced in 1923, replacing the Indian rupee which had been in use in Burma for about two centuries. One kyat is subdivided into 100 pyas, and one kyat is subdivided into 100 cents. Coins have been minted in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 kyats, and 1, 5, 10 and 25 pyas, though the highest four denominations are rarely used.\n\nThe coins and notes currently in circulation are:\n\nBanknotes Coins\n\nKyat\n\n50, 100, 500, 1000 Kyat\n\n5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 Pyas\n\n1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 Cents\n\n50, 100, 500, 1000 Cents\n\n5, 10, 25, 50, 100\n\nCheck out the latest exchange rates!\n\nMyanmar Currency History\n\nDuring the last half of the 19th century, large quantities of Indian coins circulated in Burma. In 1885, Burma began to issue its own coinage, in a new decimal system. The rupee and the double rupee were equivalent to one kyat. These coins were not for circulation outside of Burma and were not legal tender in India. A similar coinage was issued in the last year of the 19th century, using slightly different weights and diameters for the three silver coins and for the copper coins.\n\nDuring World War I, the Burmese Government began issuing a series of paper notes for 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 rupees. They were overprinted on banknotes of the Imperial Bank of India, the currency used for exchange in Burma until the mid-1930s.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the paper money of several countries was in circulation in Burma. Since the demand for small denomination notes was greatest, the British Government began to issue India notes in 1925. They were of low denomination, being in the denominations of 5, 10 and 20 rupees. The existing paper money was then demonetised.\n\nIn 1940, the Japanese occupied Burma and issued their own notes in place of the British issues. These notes continued to be in use until 1945, when the British re-established control of the country. In 1942, emergency notes were introduced, in the denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 rupees. These notes were overprinted on paper notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nIn 1946, a new series of notes was issued in Burma. This consisted of Indian notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India, overprinted B.E.P. and the State Bank of Burma. These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 rupees.\n\nThe present series of notes began in 1951. These notes are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 kyats.\n\nThe \"Burmese\" rupee, issued by the British between 1885 and 1896, was a fixed exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence (two and one-third rupees).\n\nThe U.S. dollar was established as the national currency of Burma in 1885 and is still the predominant currency in use in Myanmar.\n\nBanking in Myanmar\n\nMyanmar has an international banking system, with at least 7 major banks operating there. These include the state-owned Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and the private Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB), National Bank of Commerce (NBC), Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB), Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), Myanmar Mayflower Bank (MMB), Myanma Ahlia Bank (MAB), and Myanma Security Bank (MSB).\n\nMost commercial banks use the SWIFT system to transfer funds, and many banks in Myanmar accept electronic banking services through mobile phone banking, Internet banking, and ATMs. Some smaller banks still deal only in cash, but since cash is used mainly for larger transactions and shopping, and with so many ATMs in service now, it is no longer a problem.\n\n\n\nMyanmar currency info\n\nMyanmar info\n\nGuide to Myanmar\n\nCurrency information on country homepages<|endoftext|>This week at Marvel there’s an “Armor Wars” as the New Warriors reunite!

This report shows that anti-LGBT victimization in school is a serious problem for a large number of students. It also provides data on other forms of bullying and discriminatory treatment that LGBT students experience. Some of the findings of this report are particularly disturbing. For example, over half (53.1 percent) of LGBT students experienced feeling unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation, over one-quarter (26.1 percent) because of their gender expression, and over one-third (35.2 percent) because of both their sexual orientation and gender expression. This harassment and discrimination takes a toll on these students' well-being. The impact of the harassment and discrimination experienced by LGBT students is serious. LGBT students were more likely than non-LGBT students to report several adverse outcomes. For example, they were more likely than non-LGBT students to report high levels of depression (33.1 percent of LGBT students compared to 19.8 percent of non-LGBT students), to have seriously considered attempting suicide (32.2 percent of LGBT students compared to 13.2 percent of non-LGBT students), and to have made a suicide attempt (21.8 percent of LGBT students compared to 4.3 percent of non-LGBT students). Students who were more highly victimized were also more likely to experience these negative outcomes. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no anti-LGBT victimization, students who experienced a great deal of anti-LGBT victimization were more than three times as likely to have been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (10.0 percent compared to 3.6 percent), more than three times as likely to have been threatened or injured with a weapon off school property (14.7 percent compared to 4.3 percent), more than three times as likely to have experienced school violence (35.2 percent compared to 10.6 percent), more than four times as likely to have attempted suicide (25.0 percent compared to 5.7 percent), and more than six times as likely to have made a suicide attempt that required treatment from a doctor or nurse (10.4 percent compared to 1.8 percent).\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis report presents data from the National School Climate Survey (NCS), which collected data from over 7,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students ages 13–21 in public and private schools in every state and the District of Columbia during the spring of 2015. The report focuses on the experiences of LGBT students in public schools, but private school students' experiences are briefly discussed to provide context and additional information about the experiences of LGBT students in schools across the country.1 This report also includes a limited analysis of the data on the experiences of bisexual youth. This report provides the first national data on LGBT students' experiences in our nation's schools.\n\n\nLGBT students face a number of serious challenges at school, and this report provides a comprehensive look at the extent of the problem and its impact on LGBT students. Many LGBT students have experienced verbal harassment, physical assault, and sexual violence at school. For example, over half (53.1 percent) of LGBT students have felt unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, over one-quarter (26.1 percent) because of their gender expression, and over one-third (35.2 percent) because of both their sexual orientation and gender expression. In addition, over one-third (35.2 percent) of LGBT students have been verbally harassed and 19.6 percent have been physically attacked at school in the past year because of their sexual orientation or gender expression. These figures are even higher for transgender students: over half (53.8 percent) have felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression and over one-third (36.2 percent) because of their gender identity. Furthermore, over one-quarter (27.2 percent) of LGBT students have missed at least one entire day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable, and the prevalence of truancy increases further for transgender students: 40.1 percent of transgender students have missed at least one day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable.\n\n\nThis report also shows that the harassment and discrimination that LGBT students experience can lead to serious and negative outcomes for these students, including lower school engagement, lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction, and higher levels of depression and even higher levels of suicidal behavior. Over one-third (34.7 percent) of LGBT students reported missing school for at least one day during the month before the survey because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable. Students who experienced more victimization because of their LGBT status were also more likely to report this type of adverse outcome. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no victimization, students who experienced a great deal of victimization were almost four times as likely to have missed at least one day of school in the month before the survey because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable (45.6 percent compared to 12.3 percent).\n\n\nThe negative impact of this victimization on LGBT students can be seen in their reports of lower levels of engagement in school activities, lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction, and higher levels of depression. LGBT students who experienced high levels of victimization because of their sexual orientation, gender expression, or both were more likely than students who experienced low levels of victimization to feel that they could not be themselves at school (68.6 percent compared to 42.2 percent) and to feel unhappy or depressed at school (40.7 percent compared to 19.5 percent). Students who experienced high levels of victimization because of their sexual orientation, gender expression, or both were also more likely to report symptoms of depression than students who experienced low levels of victimization. For example, compared to students who experienced little or no victimization, students who experienced high levels of victimization were almost twice as likely to report feeling unhappy or depressed (38.7 percent compared to 20.2 percent) and almost three times as likely to report feeling less happy than other students (14.3 percent compared to 5.4 percent).\n\n\nData from the 2015 NCS show that many students still face serious and pervasive mistreatment and discrimination at school. These experiences can have a serious negative impact on students' well-being. This is especially true for transgender and gender non-conforming students who are most likely to"
"The band's creative soul and ringleader, Robert Pollard, reflects on the wild success of Guided By Voices as well as his own triumphs and tragedies.\n\nRobert Pollard — the creative soul and ringleader of Guided By Voices — is a living embodiment of the enduring power of rock ‘n’ roll. Pollard, whose band just released its 15th album, August By Cake, has lived a life that’s been as varied as it has been eventful. From crafting classic lo-fi pop records and guiding his beloved group to victory after victory for over two decades, to overcoming multiple tragedies that threatened to undo him, Pollard has endured and endured well.\n\nFrom rock ‘n’ roll heartbreak to musical triumphs and to the stories of his childhood friends who took their own lives, the tales behind Pollard’s life are as varied as the songs he’s written over the years. They’re full of sweetness, heartache and inspiration — the kind that only music can provide.\n\nHere, Pollard reflects on the enduring and wonderful power of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nOn being inspired by Bob Dylan\n\n“He made rock ‘n’ roll feel alive to me, you know? He just did things no one else was doing. The first time I heard his music, I was just in awe of it. I thought he was one of the only people doing something different in music and it really inspired me to make a rock band.”\n\nOn working at Tower Records\n\n“I worked at Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard in the Eighties. I was in a band that was signed to a major label and we were going to go on tour. We were going to make our first big move out to L.A. and the band broke up in Pittsburgh. I was heartbroken. I went to L.A. anyway and got a job at Tower and the band started to do really well in Pittsburgh. I started to realize that I was being a moron by working at a job that didn’t have anything to do with music. I should have been playing music.\n\n“Then, I met people that worked at the store — people that worked in the music section — and they were people that were into the same kind of music that I was. They were all very into the new wave thing that was going on at that time and I was very into the punk scene and I was discovering all this underground music. That was a good time because I was discovering so many great bands and all these great people.”\n\nOn putting together Guided By Voices\n\n“I was living in this little house on Cass Avenue in Detroit and I would just record these songs in the basement. I didn’t think anyone would be interested. I just thought I was doing this for myself. Then, people started calling me and saying they wanted to play on the songs and asking if I could make copies of them. Eventually, I had enough to make a record. I was putting the band together around the same time.\n\n“In the beginning, it was just one song. The whole point was to just have one song on a compilation of different artists from Michigan. That was the point of the whole thing. It was like, ‘Oh, that’s fun. That’s really fun. Let’s do another song.’ It just became something else. Then, I started working with the other people. The other people were my friends. My friends were just my buddies that I’d played music with. The first couple of years was just me and my buddies doing these songs. Then, it started to become a bigger thing and we started to tour and it became something else. It just turned into something else. It was an accident that it happened.”\n\nOn his songwriting approach\n\n“My songs have always come from an unconscious, naive place. I really have to focus on a song and work on a song in order for it to have a definite melody or a definite idea. The words, I kind of write more like a novel and I try to write songs that work like a story. When I’m doing them, I’m trying to do it like a movie. I’m trying to think of it in terms of a movie and I’m trying to create characters and set the scenes and tell the story and make it a little bit deeper than what you would normally expect from a pop song. I’m trying to take it to a different level in some ways. That’s always been my goal and that’s always been my style.\n\n“I don’t think I’m trying to reinvent the wheel, I just think that I’m trying to take things that are already in existence and make them bigger and more beautiful and a little more complete. I don’t know. I don’t really try to analyze it that much. I’ve always written songs in the same way and the only thing that’s changed is the way I record them. I used to record them all on a boombox and then, as we went along, we started to get more and more into studio work.”\n\nOn recording songs at home\n\n“I like to record in a place that’s not a studio. I’ve always liked to record in a place where I could have access to as much stuff as possible. I really enjoy it when I have a lot of cool things to play with. I always like to record at home. I think it’s important to make the place you record at like a laboratory, you know? I like to have it be a lab. If I could, I’d have every piece of equipment ever made and be able to put it all in one room and be able to experiment with every sound I could possibly make. It’s so much fun and it’s so much work at the same time, too. I love it.”\n\nOn his songwriting process\n\n“The way I work, I just keep track of my thoughts and feelings. I think about it when I’m walking or when I’m eating or I’m just doing stuff. I just keep track of stuff and I write down a lot of notes and I try to pay attention to things. My life is so boring, really, you know? I don’t do anything that exciting. I just pay attention to things and I think about stuff and I write down little ideas. I do that all the time. I write little ideas all the time and I just try to remember them and try to put them in a folder.\n\n“It’s kind of like a filing system. The filing system is in my head. I try to remember everything I think about and I try to write it down and then, eventually, it becomes a song. Then, I try to look at the songs that are done and I try to pick the ones that seem to be the best and start thinking about them in terms of a story or a character or a scenario or something that would be entertaining. I have to think about all the things that are going on in my life and try to piece things together like a collage.\n\n“Then, when it comes to the recording, I’m thinking about the whole thing as a complete package. I’m thinking about the sound of it and I’m thinking about how I’m going to mix the album and everything. I’m thinking about the lyrics and the voice. Everything is kind of part of a bigger thing and the sound and the performance is really important.”\n\nOn keeping it simple\n\n“It’s easier to write when you’re just keeping it simple. When you start to complicate things, it becomes too big of a thing to think about. That’s when the song becomes too precious and you can’t finish it or you start getting scared of it or something like that. Then, you get caught up in the emotion of it and you can’t do it. You have to remember that it’s just something you’re doing to pass the time. It’s just something you’re doing for fun. That’s what it is for me. It’s just fun. I’m not trying to be any big shot or anything like that. I’m just trying to do something that’s fun and I’m just trying to make something that’s going to give me some satisfaction. I’m just trying to do something that’s going to be fun to listen to and fun to make.”\n\nOn his songwriting being like therapy\n\n“Yeah. I’m not trying to be a serious writer or anything like that. I’m not trying to be pretentious at all. I just want to make a record that I’d like to listen to.”\n\nOn the joy of performing\n\n“It’s a good feeling, you know? There’s something very satisfying about it. You just can’t stop it, you know? I’ve been doing it for so long and it just doesn’t go away. You can’t stop it. I just keep on doing it and I can’t stop it. I think that’s the reason why I do it, you know?”\n\nOn discovering The Beatles\n\n“The Beatles made"
"CHICAGO (AP) — An American Airlines pilot has been removed from flying duties after he temporarily parked a plane on a taxiway where four other airliners were waiting to take off at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.\n\nAn investigation into the Saturday incident is ongoing, airline spokesman Ross Feinstein said Sunday.\n\nFeinstein said the pilot has been taken off flying duty \"pending the outcome of the investigation.\" He didn't specify how long the pilot would be grounded.\n\nNo other crew members were disciplined, and the incident won't affect the scheduling of the roughly 3,000 flights a day the airline operates around the world, Feinstein said.\n\nHe declined to release the name of the pilot or the number of years he had been flying for the airline.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that the pilot of the American Airlines plane, which had arrived from Nashville, Tenn., was supposed to go to a designated taxiway but instead went to a parallel taxiway where four other airliners were waiting for clearance to take off.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how close the plane came to taking off.\n\nAccording to radar information cited in the aviation department statement, the aircraft came within 100 feet of an aircraft on the ground and approximately 200 feet from another aircraft.\n\nThe aviation department is investigating the incident along with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAmerican Airlines has endured two crashes this year and five in 2015. Saturday's incident is unlikely to do much to allay the fears of passengers and the traveling public.\n\n\"It's obviously one of those things that happen occasionally. It's a pretty serious mistake,\" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. \"It's a reminder that airline pilots are human beings and that despite their extensive training, sometimes they make mistakes.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Don Babwin contributed to this report.<|endoftext|>As a manufacturer, it is easy to produce one-of-a-kind pieces, but even easier to make a product for everyone, because every piece is made to the same specifications. What happens when you decide to make a new product and to have a bigger impact? You might think that you have to start with an already existing product and create something new. But this is not always true.\n\nSometimes you need to start from scratch and create something new – a new form, a new material, new applications or new customer experiences. This is what happened when Ikea created the LÖMSK light collection – a range of products made of plaster and leather, using two materials that we usually associate with other products.\n\nLÖMSK: it´s easy being a one-of-a-kind light\n\nTwo elements were the starting point of the LÖMSK light collection: an existing material and a very unusual use for it. Plaster and leather are very traditional materials that are linked to very different products. We know plaster for its use in wallpapers, ceilings and sculptures, but it is not very common to use it in products such as lights or furniture. Leather has a much stronger association with leather goods, clothes, bags or shoes. And in fact, leather is one of the most used materials in the furniture industry.\n\nTwo products, plaster and leather, that are very common to different types of industries but never used together.\n\nIkea wanted to combine these two materials in a collection of lights, lamps and other decorative elements, in order to make a complete lighting system that can be easily incorporated into any interior and made more personal.\n\nA creative team started exploring ways of using these two materials in a complete lighting collection. They started experimenting with different elements such as the light bulb and the suspension, to combine them and to make sure they can adapt to the maximum number of situations. The development of the light was not a process of making a more perfect product, but rather a process of exploring new ways of using existing products.\n\nAs a result, they developed three series of products. One made of plaster and leather, and two others made of plaster. The leather light is one of the most surprising elements in the collection, as it is hard to believe that this kind of leather is the same that we see in jackets or shoes.\n\nThe leather used in the light is dyed in different colours in order to add interest to the design and it is used to create the “U” shape that holds the light bulb. This element was designed to be a flexible element in the light, allowing the user to change the direction of the light and adapt it to different uses.\n\nFinally, the leather light can also be suspended with a wire, making it ideal for reading lights.\n\nThe second series, made of plaster, is the plateroom series, and the third series is a collection of lamps made of plaster with different shades. The aim was to use plaster to make different types of lamps that can adapt to the different sizes of space. This is achieved by combining the plaster with different shades and creating elements such as the plateroom bench and the plateroom table, with different dimensions and shades.\n\nThere is an important message that Ikea wants to communicate with this collection: that it is possible to create something new and original.\n\nYou need to start with something simple but at the same time creative and unusual. This is what Ikea wants to achieve with this collection: creating a new product that is easy to understand and appreciate, but at the same time has an innovative design and can be used in different types of interior.\n\nThis can be achieved by starting with a very simple element and having an open mind, as the designers did with this collection. Ikea has created a very unusual product that is adaptable to different situations and can be adapted to any kind of interior or architecture.<|endoftext|>Good for price\n\nBy Anonymous\n\n06 Apr 2012\n\nShimano PD-T400 SPD Pedals\n\n3 / 5\n\nI recommend this product\n\nCons rubber grip strip wears quickly, not made to wear a cleat off road or in the mud Pros inexpensive, comfortable, easy to adjust, replaceable\n\nMy first set lasted me 4 years on the commuter bike and MTB with up to 50 mile/week rides. The rubber grips are made to wear down quickly, and don't offer a lot of friction to hold on to (that's good and bad), but replaceable. The cleat is replaceable too, which is nice if you walk on the pedals a lot (they do have walkable cleats).\n\n\n\nOverall, a great value pedal for commuter bikes.

"Jubal Early\n\nJubal Anderson Early (July 14, 1816July 2, 1894) was a Confederate general in the American Civil War and a politician after the war. Although he served almost the entire war in the eastern theater, his most significant contributions were in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, which ended in the stalemate at Petersburg, Virginia, and the capture of the Union garrison at Lynchburg, Virginia. Early is considered among the best Confederate generals who never served in the Army of Northern Virginia.\n\nEarly was born in Southampton County, Virginia, the seventh of ten children of Ruth (Anderson) Early and Judge John Early, a former governor of Virginia and member of the United States Congress. In 1825, Early attended Charlotte Hall Military Academy. He graduated second in his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1838, placing him above such future generals as Stonewall Jackson and Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nEarly was appointed a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. He served as an aide to General Winfield Scott in the War with Mexico and fought in the Battle of Molino del Rey and the Battle of Chapultepec. Early served as the acting chief of artillery in the assault on the city of Mexico, and received two brevets for his bravery in these battles. He was one of the first officers to enter Mexico City, and he served as an artillery instructor at West Point from 1847 to 1852. Early served as a major in the United States Army in the Seminole Wars in 1855, and as a captain in the United States Dragoons in 1858.\n\nEarly entered the Virginia Military Institute in 1852, and became a professor of mathematics at the Institute, where he taught until the Civil War. He was known for his severity as a disciplinarian. Early became known as a superb military tactician and administrator, as well as an able administrator and strategist.\n\nIn 1860, Early entered politics, running as a Democrat for one of the two seats in the Virginia House of Delegates from Southampton County, but he was defeated. The state seceded from the Union on April 17, 1861, and Early was commissioned as a colonel of artillery in the Virginia militia on May 14. When Virginia militia units were activated for Confederate service, Early was appointed a brigadier general of Virginia forces on May 27.\n\nEarly initially commanded a brigade in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett. When Garnett died at the Battle of Mill Springs, Early was promoted to brigadier general on January 16, 1862. His brigade was assigned to Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith's division in the Army of Northern Virginia. Early fought in the Peninsula Campaign, including the Siege of Yorktown, during which his brigade was an important factor in repulsing a Union assault on the right flank of the Confederate entrenchments at Savage's Station. Early received praise for his actions at Hanover Court House.\n\nEarly distinguished himself during the Seven Days Battles. He received his commission as a major in the Confederate Regular Army on June 9, 1862, but was later returned to his previous rank of colonel in the reserves. During the Northern Virginia Campaign, he received plaudits for his actions at the Second Battle of Bull Run.\n\nEarly was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate regular army on October 11, 1862. He was given command of a brigade in Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division of A.P. Hill's III Corps. During the Maryland Campaign, Early performed well at the Battle of South Mountain.\n\nDuring the Battle of Fredericksburg, Early was severely wounded in the right thigh and temporarily assigned to administrative duties. He returned to the field in time to defeat Union Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's offensive at the Battle of Chancellorsville. At Chancellorsville, Early performed ably in combat and earned praise for his conduct as a brigade commander. Early was sent to western Virginia, where he defeated Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans at the Battle of Mill Springs. After Chancellorsville, Early was promoted to the permanent rank of brigadier general in the Confederate Regular Army on May 21, 1863, and given command of a division.\n\nEarly fought under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Early's old brigade was reassigned to Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson. The Second Battle of Kernstown was his most significant contribution during the Valley Campaigns. Following the Valley Campaigns, Early was assigned to Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge's command in the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nHe conducted the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Following Early's victory at the Battle of Lynchburg in June 1864, Early's army became separated by Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter's raid. Hunter's force was driven from the Valley in the Battle of Lynchburg by Early's troops. During the Valley Campaigns, Early defeated Union Maj. Gen. George Crook at the Battle of Rutherford's Farm and the Battle of Tom's Brook, drove Maj. Gen. David Hunter from the Valley in the Second Battle of Kernstown, and defeated Union Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan at the Third Battle of Winchester.\n\nEarly defeated Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter's Valley Campaign in the Second Battle of Kernstown in July 1864. He then crossed into Maryland and threatened Washington, D.C., forcing Grant to send reinforcements to the capital area. During the subsequent Valley Campaigns of 1864, Early defeated Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan at the Battle of Opequon, the Third Battle of Winchester, and the Battle of Fisher's Hill. Sheridan's victory at the Battle of Cedar Creek forced Early to retreat back to the Valley.\n\nEarly was assigned to the Department of the West and ordered to reinforce the Confederate Army of Tennessee, but Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge convinced him to resist Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's advance. At the beginning of the Atlanta Campaign, Early was given command of the newly created Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee. During the Battle of Resaca, he launched an unsuccessful assault against a Union fortification on the western bank of the Oostenaula River, suffering heavy casualties. During the subsequent battles of Adairsville and Cassville, his corps attempted to flank Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's left flank, but his subordinates were slow in attacking and failed to coordinate their movements with other Confederate forces. After the Confederates suffered defeat at the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Early retreated with his corps to Lovejoy's Station. He ordered Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham's division to open the Battle of Atlanta by attacking the Union force under Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. Early was in the town of Marietta when he learned that Lt. Gen. John B. Hood was wounded during the Battle of Atlanta, and he returned to Atlanta to take command of the army.\n\nDuring the subsequent Siege of Atlanta, the Army of Tennessee lacked provisions and was forced to withdraw from Atlanta. The army was defeated during the subsequent pursuit, and Early's corps was heavily engaged at the Battle of Ezra Church. In November 1864, the Army of Tennessee was reorganized and Early was given command of the new Second Corps. At the Battle of Franklin, he was killed by a shot through the heart, and his corps suffered significant casualties. The Second Corps was commanded by Maj. Gen. William B. Bate after Early's death. Bate was also wounded and captured, and the corps was virtually destroyed. Bate's capture led to another shakeup of the army's command structure, and Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart assumed command of the Second Corps.\n\nEarly was buried at the Old Methodist Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia, but the cemetery closed and his remains were moved to Richmond National Cemetery.\n\nThe Virginia Historical Society operates the Jubal Early Memorial Cemetery near New Market, Virginia, where he is buried.\n\nEarly was known as \"Old Jubal\" to his men and \"Fighting Joe\" to his friends. Confederate General Robert E. Lee was a friend of Early's, and named his youngest son, Jubal Anderson, after him.\n\nIn the film \"Gettysburg\", Early was portrayed by actor Martin Sheen. The movie presented Early as a vain, glory-seeking but weak commander who bickered with fellow Confederate generals Joseph E. Johnston and James Longstreet over who was in command of the Army of Tennessee.\n\nHe is also featured in Jeff Shaara's \"The Last Full Measure\" trilogy, where he is portrayed by Jon Voight.\n\nThe James River Squadron was a Confederate Navy organization during the American Civil War which operated on the James River, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Al-Hamzah, Yemen\n\nAl-Hamzah is a village in western central Yemen.

After optimization, it was determined that a total of 6.6 ml of bovine plasma (0.5 mg protein/ml) and 1.2 ml of milk sample were sufficient for the analysis of 0.2 ml of milk. A total of 35 ml of buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0) containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, boronate, Con A, and 0.5 M sodium sulfate were added to an 8 × 100 mm borosilicate glass column. Bovine plasma and milk samples were passed through the column at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The flow-through was collected and fractions were obtained by passing 1.5 ml of fresh buffer A through the column. Bovine serum albumin was detected in the fractions after staining with the Con A.

"André Le Nôtre – André Le Nôtre, also known as Le Nôtre, was a landscape architect, responsible for the design of the gardens of many of the most famous French châteaux of the 17th century, including Versailles. He is popularly known as the father of the profession and he was born in Paris, the son of Pierre Le Nôtre, a painter of miniatures and Marie Le Nôtre. He was trained in his fathers occupation, he did some paintings by the time he was sixteen. He travelled to Italy with Pierre Berchet in 1640, and worked with the architect Jacques Lemercier, from 1646 he was occupied with architectural drawing for the Louvre. He was made a member of the Académie at Mans in 1650, Le Nôtres first known landscape project was at the château of Vaux-le-Vicomte, for his distant relative, Nicolas Fouquet. Here he was more open to the imagination, transforming the plan into a Picturesque and Romantic garden. His work showed a tendency towards the natural and asymmetrical, Le Nôtre was unable to visit Italy on account of wars with the Italian states. His influence was limited to parts of the northeast of France, Le Nôtres first projects in this style were done for the court of the prince de Condé. The château of Chantilly, belonging to the princess of Condé, François, Le Nôtre achieved the most at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, for Louis XIV and his duc de Bourgogne, later the duc dOrléans. Le Nôtre created a estate at Marly, and, at the Trianon, for the young Louis XIV. His work transformed the old fort into a palace, more suitable for the residence of the king. He is also responsible for the landscapes of the gardens of the Château de Maisons and Château de Saint-Cloud, Le Nôtre died in 1681, and was succeeded by his son Jean-Charles Le Nôtre, to whom he had taught his encyclopedic style, and his son-in-law François Dunan. The design of the gardens of the Château de Marly was a project of Le Nôtres. They were designed to be seen from the top of the terrace, the perspectives and size of the gardens were calculated to surprise the spectators. Le Nôtre planned the gardens following the Renaissance principles of regularity, symmetry and he was also responsible for the modifications made to the original plan, done by Charles Le Brun and the gardener Martin Charbonnier, who remade the terrace and the parterres. The final result was the ancestor of modern formal gardens, in 1660 and 1661, Le Nôtre built two mansions on the Place Royale in Paris, for the jewellers Louis de Lancy and Balthazar Claquin. In 1664, Le Nôtre and Claude Perrault collaborated on a project for the west side of the Louvre. Le Nôtres last landscape was the garden around the château de Sceaux, a project which was incomplete at the time of his death in 1681\n\n9. Gardens of Versailles – The Gardens of Versailles occupy part of what was once the Domaine royal de Versailles, the royal demesne of the château of Versailles. Situated to the west of the palace, the gardens cover some 800 hectares of land, in addition to the meticulous manicured lawns, parterres of flowers, and sculptures are the fountains, which are located throughout the garden. Dating from the time of Louis XIV and still using much of the network of hydraulics as was used during the Ancien Régime. On weekends from spring to early autumn, the administration of the museum sponsors the Grandes Eaux – spectacles during which all the fountains in the gardens are in full play. In 1979, the gardens along with the château were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, one of thirty-one such designations in France. With Louis XIII’s final purchase of lands from Jean-François de Gondi in 1632 and his assumption of the role of Versailles in the 1630s. Records indicate that late in the decade Claude Mollet and Hilaire Masson designed the gardens and this early layout, which has survived in the so-called Du Bus plan of c.1662, shows an established topography along which lines of the gardens evolved. This is evidenced in the definition of the main east-west. From this point forward, the expansion of the gardens of Versailles followed the expansions of the château, accordingly, Louis XIVs building campaigns apply to the gardens as well. At every stage the prescribed tour was managed, under the Sun Kings directions. First building campaign In 1662, minor modifications to the château were undertaken, existing bosquets and parterres were expanded and new ones created. Most significant among the creations at this time were the Orangerie, the Versailles Orangery, which was designed by Louis Le Vau, was located south of the château, a situation that took advantage of the natural slope of the hill. It provided an area in which orange trees were kept during the winter months. The Grotte de Thétys, which was located to the north of the château, formed part of the iconography of the château, the grotto would be completed during the second building campaign. By 1664, the gardens had evolved to the point that Louis XIV inaugurated the gardens with the fête galante called Les Plaisirs de l’Île Enchantée. The event, which officially was to celebrate his mother, Anne d’Autriche, guests were regaled with fabulous entertainments in the gardens over a period of one week. As a result of this fête – particularly the lack of housing for guests, Louis realized the shortcomings of Versailles and began to expand the château and the gardens once again. With this new phase of construction, the gardens assumed the topographical and iconological design vocabulary that would remain in force until the 18th century. ”\n\n10. French language – French is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages, French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues doïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to Frances past overseas expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages, a French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French. French is a language in 29 countries, most of which are members of la francophonie. As of 2015, 40% of the population is in Europe, 35% in sub-Saharan Africa, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East, 8% in the Americas. French is the fourth-most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union, 1/5 of Europeans who do not have French as a mother tongue speak French as a second language. As a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the 17th and 18th century onward, French was introduced to new territories in the Americas, Africa, most second-language speakers reside in Francophone Africa, in particular Gabon, Algeria, Mauritius, Senegal and Ivory Coast. In 2015, French was estimated to have 77 to 110 million native speakers, approximately 274 million people are able to speak the language. The Organisation internationale de la Francophonie estimates 700 million by 2050, in 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese. Under the Constitution of France, French has been the language of the Republic since 1992. France mandates the use of French in official government publications, public education except in specific cases, French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland called Romandie, of which Geneva is the largest city. French is the language of about 23% of the Swiss population. French is also a language of Luxembourg, Monaco, and Aosta Valley, while French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the Channel Islands. A plurality of the worlds French-speaking population lives in Africa and this number does not include the people living in non-Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language. Due to the rise of French in Africa, the total French-speaking population worldwide is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050, French is the fastest growing language on the continent. French is mostly a language in Africa, but it has become a first language in some urban areas, such as the region of Abidjan, Ivory Coast and in Libreville. There is not a single African French, but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous African languages, sub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand, because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth\n\n11.

"SINGAPORE - The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said on Monday (June 19) that it had seized more than 80,000 methamphetamine pills worth an estimated street value of more than $3.1 million during two separate operations.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Monday, CNB said that the drugs had been seized at Tuas Checkpoint on May 24.\n\nIn the first operation, CNB officers were deployed at the checkpoint when a Singaporean male traveller was found to be acting suspiciously at about 9.15pm.\n\n\"When challenged, the traveller was found to be concealing two plastic packets inside his rectum,\" CNB said. \"Upon further search of his vehicle, officers found an additional three packets containing a total of 40,160 meth tablets hidden inside a sling bag.\"\n\nCNB officers arrested the 33-year-old man. He has been assessed and found to be mentally sound. He will be charged in court on Tuesday (June 20).\n\nIn a second operation that took place at about 11.45pm that day, CNB officers detected two suspicious-looking men acting suspiciously at a pedestrian walkway near the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex.\n\nAfter conducting a search, CNB officers found a total of 17,280 meth tablets hidden in the roof lining of the car.\n\nThe two men, aged 34 and 50, are Singaporeans.\n\n\"Investigations are ongoing,\" CNB said.<|endoftext|>Hello there!

I heard at least five,” said Elijah Rodriguez, 17, who works near the shooting scene.\n\nIn the chaos of the moment, a woman, also described as being in her 30s, and a man, were wounded as bystanders rushed to escape the gunfire, Johnson said.\n\nAn officer who arrived at the scene was shot in the head at point blank range, but his vest saved his life, Johnson said.\n\n(click for source)<|endoftext|>Still loading...\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AA AB AC AD AE AF AG AH AI AJ AK AL AM AN AO AP AQ AR AS AT AU AV AW AX AY AZ BA BB BC BD BE BF BG BH BI BJ BK BL BM BN BO BP BQ BR BS BT BU BV BW BX BY BZ CA CB CC CD CE CF CG CH CI CJ CK CL CM CN CO CP CQ CR CS CT CU CV 1 Einträge bis zum 20.04.2015 – löschen bitte bei neuen Einträgen 2 Vorname (allg.)

They argued that residents in the water districts that purchase the water were being punished for water overuse by residents of Pueblo and Pueblo County, even though they don’t buy the water.\n\nThe Pueblo County commissioners sent a letter to CSWW last month that said, in part: “We do not consider that the Pueblo Reservoir can be drained without impact to the water service area, and it is our position that this is discriminatory.”\n\nThe commissioners sent another letter Tuesday saying the county is committed to working with the Colorado Springs Water Works on this issue and future water issues.\n\nCSWW agreed to issue a second letter to water districts in Pueblo and Pueblo County clarifying that water would be available.\n\nThe districts that had been receiving water have already begun taking the water again, said Dennis Tenorio, general manager of the Northern Water Users Association. He said the water districts bought a $200,000 storage tank to hold water when there is a shortage.\n\nMay said CSWW has worked with the districts to understand why the Pueblo Reservoir’s level is low and how to address the problem.\n\n“There’s a huge, huge amount of water being used up there,” May said. “But, with this mutual understanding, I’m confident we’ll be able to make this a long-term fix for everyone.”\n\nTim Hoover: 303-954-1626, thoover@denverpost.com or twitter.com/timhoover<|endoftext|>The layout is interesting, and the selection of buttons and values are nicely suited for a steampunk background.\n\nThe mix of cold blue and warmer browns works well, and overall I think it would be very effective on a phone.<|endoftext|>BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Monday presented a proposed new Cabinet to parliament for approval, which is expected to include a defense minister and an interior minister.\n\nAbadi said in a statement that a number of the ministers would remain in their posts, while some would get new assignments and one would be replaced.\n\nThe move would boost his government’s credibility as it takes on the Islamic State group, which swept across much of northern and western Iraq last summer. It would also help the prime minister gain influence with a parliament elected in April.\n\nLawmakers met Monday afternoon in a closed session to hear from the prime minister and approve the new Cabinet.\n\nIraqi lawmakers already have approved acting ministers in the foreign and defense portfolios in anticipation of a new Cabinet.\n\nThe proposed new defense minister is Khaled al-Obeidi, the chief of staff of the armed forces.\n\nThe candidate for the interior portfolio is Mohammed al-Ghabban, an official in the predominantly Shiite paramilitary forces known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. The forces were created last summer after Iraq’s most powerful Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, issued a fatwa, or religious decree, calling for Iraqis to fight the extremists.\n\nThe new Cabinet members will have to undergo further screening before they can be sworn in.\n\nAn aide to the prime minister told The Associated Press that the interior minister would replace Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban, who has been acting minister since March. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nThe process of forming the Cabinet has been drawn out, with delays because of disputes between Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish blocs over who would hold key posts.\n\nIt was not clear if the interior minister would be a Sunni or a Shiite. It also wasn’t clear if the defense minister would be a Sunni or a Shiite.\n\nWhen the new Cabinet is sworn in, the president will be able to name a new Cabinet as demanded by the constitution, giving him greater leverage in the new legislature.\n\nAbadi, a Shiite, has struggled to overcome his dependence on political parties, some of which receive support from neighboring Iran.\n\nDuring the U.S. occupation, he served as minister of communications under the Shiite-led government of then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. He was tapped as prime minister last summer after his predecessor was ousted amid an Islamic State offensive that overran about a third of the country.\n\nAbadi promised to unite Iraq, which is divided among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, but has struggled to overcome his dependence on political parties, some of which receive support from neighboring Iran.\n\nThe State Department in Washington announced the appointment Monday of Stuart Jones, a career diplomat, as the new U.S. ambassador to Iraq, replacing Douglas Silliman.<|endoftext|>November 11th, 2012\n\nWhile we’re waiting for the official Apple iPod nano 2G Review to come, I wanted to share my review and give you my thoughts. I’ve now had the second generation of the iPod nano for about a week and wanted to give you my thoughts about it.\n\n(Last Updated: Nov 12th, 2012)\n\nThe Physical Design\n\nI think Apple got this design right with the nano. It’s very thin and light, which I like. It’s almost identical to the 1st gen nano, but thinner, and with a larger screen. The big deal for me is that it is so much thinner and smaller than the previous nano. I don’t know why I like that so much, but it does make it so much easier to carry around.\n\nThe Screen\n\nI was initially concerned about the small size of the screen. My fear was that I wouldn’t be able to see the screen as well, or that it would be harder to navigate the menus. I’m very happy to report that the screen size is perfect for what I want. I think the new screen is just large enough to easily navigate menus and change songs.\n\nThe Sound Quality\n\nI was very skeptical about the new sound quality. I don’t have a lot of time to listen to music, and when I do, I usually do it while at the gym. So for me, sound quality is not a huge priority, but I was concerned about it with the new nano.\n\nWell, I am very happy to say that the sound quality is much better than the first generation nano. It is not better than my 4th gen iPod touch, but it is about the same, and sounds really good to me.\n\nThe Battery Life\n\nThe battery life of the new nano is what I was most worried about. The previous nano only got about 5 hours of battery life when playing music, and this is the same battery as the first generation nano. But I was pleasantly surprised by the new nano. It only lasts about 8 hours, but that’s fine for me. My goal is to carry a nano that can give me 8 hours of listening time at the gym. The only time I need longer than that is when I’m traveling for work, and I have my iPhone with me for music.\n\nThe Software\n\nI’m not going to go into too much detail here, but I am very happy with the new software. I think the new interface looks great and I love that I can easily make the album art fit the screen perfectly.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I’m very happy with the new iPod nano 2G. It is the perfect size and weight for me. It sounds good, and the battery life is good enough for me. It’s nice to have an iPod that’s small enough to fit in my pocket.\n\nI would definitely recommend the new iPod nano. If you already have a 1st gen nano, the only reason to upgrade is for the size.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, is that Apple has said that"
"Advanced Biological Warfare (ABW)\n\nThere is an urgent need for \"offensive\" biological warfare (BW) capability, to complement defensive measures against an attack with biological weapons (BW). Existing defensive measures provide only limited protection against BW, and their usefulness would be significantly reduced in some circumstances. No acceptable defenses have been developed against BW agents.\n\nThis lack of adequate defenses against biological weapons is a major vulnerability in the security of the United States. The increasing danger that biological weapons will be used for hostile purposes poses an urgent need to counter the threat.\n\nModern biological warfare could include development and use of pathogenic organisms and toxins, as well as incapacitating agents. The former might well be the only BW agent of concern because of their potential for causing mass casualties.\n\nThe widespread use of modern technology has increased the availability of biological materials for use as BW agents. Current medical knowledge has increased the potential to create and spread biological weapons. This trend is expected to continue.\n\nEarly development and testing of a pathogenic agent for use in an offensive BW program would not be easily detectable. A biological agent can be disseminated in many ways and to many places with little warning. It is difficult to effectively monitor, detect, and decontaminate a wide area after an attack.\n\nStrategic Offensive Biological Warfare\n\nStrategic offensive BW provides the United States with a major deterrent against potential adversaries. As a deterrent weapon, strategic offensive BW can have a significant impact on the overall military posture of the United States and its potential adversaries. It is in the national interest of the United States to develop a military biological capability to deter an adversary from using biological weapons.\n\nStrategic offensive BW will be used against enemy personnel or facilities to inflict maximum casualties, degrade military capability, or destroy life-sustaining resources or capabilities. In military operations, strategic offensive BW would be used as part of a coordinated effort, in conjunction with other conventional and nuclear forces, and it would require integration of tactical, operational, and strategic capabilities.\n\nStrategic offensive BW could be employed by the United States to complement and support its defensive and non-military (e.g., diplomatic, political, economic, and legal) measures in the event of a biological attack. Its primary purpose would be to minimize the impact of a biological attack on the United States or its forces. Strategic offensive BW may also have applications in countering adversaries that are seeking to develop and maintain a BW capability.\n\nNon-Strategic Offensive Biological Warfare\n\nNon-strategic offensive BW may be employed in support of specific military operations against specific adversary targets. It may also be used in support of other military operations. It would be used to complement and support defensive and non-military measures in the event of a biological attack.\n\nNon-strategic offensive BW would be limited in scope and duration, but it would still be considered offensive because it would result in the infliction of casualties. Non-strategic offensive BW would be used against specific targets, rather than against a large area. It would normally be employed in peacetime as a form of anticipatory self-defense, rather than as a weapon of last resort. Non-strategic offensive BW could be conducted clandestinely to avoid a general war.\n\nThe possession of non-strategic offensive BW capabilities would enhance the deterrent posture of the United States. It would enhance US options to counter biological threats. These options include military action and other non-military actions, which could preclude the need for a military response.\n\nThe National Military Strategy (NMS) endorses non-strategic offensive BW as a credible deterrent to aggression against US interests. The NMS identifies two levels of non-strategic offensive BW for deterrence: A highly credible threat to use BW agents in response to biological attacks or a threat to use BW agents in response to a biological attack. The NMS also identifies a low-level but still credible threat to use BW agents to counter limited biological attacks, sabotage, and hostage-taking.\n\nGlobal Issues\n\nThe US BW program is important to national security and international stability. A fundamental premise of US policy is that offensive BW capabilities are legitimate instruments of national power, especially if the United States is threatened by chemical or biological weapons. The United States has an interest in dissuading the proliferation of BW programs. The development of offensive capabilities by countries without chemical or biological weapons programs or doctrines would be destabilizing and increase the likelihood of their use. The growth of indigenous BW programs in countries with other WMD programs would have similar destabilizing effects.\n\nInternational stability is jeopardized when there is uncertainty as to whether nations will abide by international legal commitments regarding BW. The US BW program is not intended to influence foreign countries, but to demonstrate the US commitment to deter the use of biological weapons and to respond if deterrence fails. BW will be maintained as a credible deterrent, but not one that would have to be used. The United States should make clear its continued intention to pursue an effective BW program to deter adversaries, if necessary.\n\nUS non-strategic offensive BW is an important element of national power and US leadership in arms control. The US BW program plays a crucial role in US leadership in arms control. Non-strategic offensive BW is necessary for full compliance with existing and emerging arms control and non-proliferation agreements. It is important for successful implementation of the CWC, the BWC, and other regional and international agreements. This would prevent the proliferation of BW programs in countries with other WMD programs.\n\nInterdiction\n\nThe inherent characteristics of biological agents make them suitable for clandestine delivery and easy to disseminate. Biological agents could be delivered clandestinely to specific personnel or facilities in areas under control of a potential adversary, without risk to the agents’ handlers.\n\nThe ability of an adversary to clandestinely deliver a biological agent makes the effectiveness of a traditional containment strategy, such as is used in the management of nuclear, chemical, and missile proliferation, problematic. A defensive strategy for biological weapons will have limited utility.\n\nInterdiction of a clandestine BW attack would require significant intelligence resources and considerable time. It would be difficult to find the attacking agent, assess the magnitude of the attack, and identify the source of the attack. If it is found, the agents are difficult to detect and are difficult to destroy. In the unlikely event that a clandestine BW attack were detected and stopped before any damage occurred, the United States would have to consider the political and military implications of conducting an extensive search for the source of the BW attack.\n\nIf an adversary does attempt to use BW, the United States would have to consider the implications of an extensive search for the source of the attack, whether it should be attempted, and what political and military actions might result. US policy is to discourage development of BW programs in countries without other WMD programs, but to take BW programs in friendly countries into account. Therefore, the United States would have to consider how the public and international community would react to the use of US resources to search for a biological attack.\n\nBiological Weapons Control\n\nUnited States policy is to discourage countries from developing and using BW and to discourage the proliferation of BW.\n\nThe United States wants to minimize the risk of WMD proliferation and to prevent or mitigate the harmful consequences of proliferation. Because BW programs are easier to develop and conceal than are nuclear, chemical, and missile programs, US policy is to take appropriate measures to minimize the risk of proliferation of BW. In the case of US friends and allies, it will consider the importance of the BW program to the defense of the country and its overall relations with that country.\n\nBiological weapons could be used in conjunction with nuclear, chemical, or other weapons. This possibility increases the potential threat posed by BW. The United States has concluded that the worldwide prohibition of BW would not eliminate the threat of their use. Although the worldwide elimination of BW is a long-term goal, there is no realistic means to reach it in the foreseeable future. The United States will continue to work toward that goal, but in the meantime it will maintain an effective BW deterrent.\n\nFormal arms control, including international verification of BW programs, would not be sufficient to prevent the clandestine development and use of BW. Biological weapons can be developed and used without a massive infrastructure. Interdiction of clandestine BW programs may not be successful. A country with both BW and chemical weapons programs would be able to attack with biological weapons without any risk of exposure of its chemical weapons program. The United States will seek to work with friendly countries to prevent proliferation of BW.\n\nThe United States would oppose a global ban on the development, possession, or use of BW because it is not a realistic possibility. Such a ban would not eliminate the threat of BW. It would be easy to evade a ban and difficult to enforce.\n\nThe United States will continue to work with the international community to reach an effective and acceptable solution to the BW problem.\n\nTechnical Issues\n\nThe United States does not want to be vulnerable to BW, and it must be able to meet the challenge of a biological attack. However, the US BW program will not be capable of protecting the United States against a chemical or nuclear attack, nor will it be able to protect against all types of biological weapons.\n\nThere is no defense against BW. The United States does not want to be vulnerable to BW. However, if an adversary did use BW, the United States would be willing to use its offensive BW capability to counter it.\n\nThere are no weapons systems or defensive measures capable of protecting against all types of biological warfare. However, a significant deterrent can be developed to dissuade potential adversaries from using BW. This would require BW programs to develop and maintain a viable capability to inflict casualties, degradation of military capability, or destruction of life-sustaining resources or capabilities.\n\nThe likelihood that a biological attack would be effective is low. The impact of biological weapons would be low compared to that of nuclear, chemical"

The main campus is located at the northern end of the Monash Freeway in Craigieburn, 25 kilometres north-west of the Melbourne central business district in Victoria, Australia. The university has approximately 1,800 students.\n\nNotre Dame Australia is a tertiary institution of the Congregation of Holy Cross, a religious community of priests and brothers founded in 1837 in Le Mans, France by Father Pierre Coudrin. The Congregation of Holy Cross was formally recognised by Pope Leo XIII in 1885. In Australia the Congregation of Holy Cross established the predecessor of Notre Dame University, the Holy Cross College, at Box Hill, Victoria in 1951. Holy Cross College was incorporated as a company in 1978 and was approved by the Victorian Government as a Catholic University College in 1981.\n\nIn January 1989 the Holy Cross College and the St. Columba's Church in Bulla moved to new premises in Craigieburn. At that time the college was renamed as the Notre Dame Institute of the Arts and the College of Commerce, Science and Technology.\n\nIn 1991 the Notre Dame Institute of the Arts, the Notre Dame Institute of the Arts (Interim), the College of Commerce, Science and Technology and the Holy Cross Seminary amalgamated to become a university college.\n\nIn 1994 the Notre Dame College of Education and the College of Science amalgamated to become the Notre Dame College of Education and Science.\n\nIn 1996 the Notre Dame Institute of the Arts was amalgamated with the College of Education and Science.\n\nIn 1997 the University of Notre Dame Australia was formally established.\n\nIn 2003 the university changed its name from the University of Notre Dame Australia to Notre Dame University Australia. The change in name reflected the development of the university's research and postgraduate research and development capabilities.\n\nIn 2005 the university changed its name back to the University of Notre Dame Australia.\n\nThe university's crest was designed by Michael Malone of Pentagram, Melbourne, and is based on the \"Cross of the Holy Spirit\", which was designed by Leonard McCoy of the University of Notre Dame, in the United States.\n\nIn 2006 Notre Dame became the first university in Australia to gain ISO 14001 certification for its environmental management systems.\n\nIn 2008 the University of Notre Dame Australia took part in the international Interfaith Center of Beijing and in the International Symposium on the contribution of religions to sustainable development, held at Shandong University in Jinan, Shandong Province, China.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame Australia has two major sites: the Craigieburn campus and the Werribee Park campus.\n\nCraigieburn campus\n\nThe Craigieburn campus, located at the northern end of the Monash Freeway, houses the Schools of Architecture, Business, Communication and Social Sciences, Education, Health, Humanities and Law, Music, Science and Sport. The campus is also home to the University's administration and a student village.\n\nWerribee Park campus\n\nThe Werribee Park campus is home to the School of Education and Social Work. The campus is also the site of the University's Sport Centre.\n\nUniversity library\n\nThe University of Notre Dame Australia Library holds over 43,000 print volumes and over 2,000 CD-ROMs. The collection covers theology, philosophy, the arts, social sciences and sciences.\n\nThe library's periodical collection contains more than 15,000 current serials including complete runs of the major theological journals. It also holds more than 2,000 current audiovisual titles, 2,000 electronic books and 3,000 electronic journal articles.

It was popularised by a number of films in the 1990s including \"Fatal Attraction\", in which Glenn Close's character Alex Forrest is known for boiling bunnies as part of her psychosis.\n\nThe film \"Fatal Attraction\" featured the villain Alex Forrest, who works as a photographer and engages in an affair with her married lover, Dan Gallagher. When she discovers that Dan is having second thoughts about the affair, she begins to stalk him and his family, which culminates in an attempted seduction of Dan's daughter, which causes Alex to be murdered by Dan.\n\nIn the 2010 video game \"Fatal Frame\", the primary antagonist is a psychopath named Miu Hinasaki. During the course of the game, she kidnaps several young girls and holds them prisoner at her house, where she sadistically mutilates them. Throughout the game, it is implied that she has been doing this for a long time, and that many other girls have disappeared without a trace.\n\nThe trope was also used in an early episode of \"Glee\" when Rachel Berry was terrorised by a former classmate, Quinn Fabray. The term has been used to refer to women in many fictional works, and has been"

He was especially a specialist in Dutch old masters, and the attribution of paintings.\n\nBredius was born on 2 July 1855 in Amsterdam, the son of a diamond merchant. He studied law at the University of Amsterdam and received his doctorate in 1879. He became a member of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1878. He and his brother, Pieter Frederik Bredius, ran the diamond business for a time after their father's death in 1895. In 1899 he and his brother retired from business and moved to the town of Laren. His brother committed suicide in 1905.\n\nIn 1911, Bredius published his first art book, \"Rembrandt: een monografie\" (Rembrandt: a monograph), a scholarly study of Rembrandt's oeuvre, based on careful research of the existing works and contemporary documentation. His other publications include \"Jan Steen\" (1914), \"Frans Hals\" (1916), \"De groote schilderijen in het Mauritshuis\" (The large paintings in the Mauritshuis) (1923), \"A descriptive catalogue of the works of Peter Paul Rubens\" (1925) and \"De schilderselders in Nederland gedurende de XVIIe en XVIIIe eeuw\" (The painters of the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries) (1927). The last book was published posthumously by his daughter.\n\nBredius was married to a daughter of Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, the art historian. Their daughter, Wilhelmina Bredius, was also an art historian.\n\nBredius was an art collector, and owned works by such artists as Frans Hals, Rembrandt and Jan Steen. He purchased many paintings and drawings at auction, and was considered to have the best collection of old masters in the Netherlands. The collection was put up for sale after his death, and many of the paintings found their way into museum collections.

The genus is native to the Americas, where it is distributed from the southern United States (Florida, Texas) to the northernmost part of Argentina (Tucumán). Species are known by many common names, including crown-peas, princess flower, Barbados pride, guizotia, maua, grama grass, whitetick, sandburs, Mexican ticks, pinquitos, piquitos, barbas de Indias, and zorillo.\n\nThe species of \"Sesalpinia\" are annual or perennial herbaceous vines, often with a woody base, reaching a height of 3 m. Leaves are bipinnate or tripinnate, made up of 10-30 leaflets, often with reddish margins. Flowers are in racemes, and are usually white to pink, though yellow and lavender flowers are known. The fruit is a pod, often with a distinctive hooked beak.\n\nThe genus is currently classified in the subfamily Mimosoideae, but the taxonomy is in need of a comprehensive phylogenetic study. The five species that have been traditionally recognized in \"Sesalpinia\" are not monophyletic. While the closest relatives of the genus are in the tribe Ingeae in subfamily Mimosoideae, \"Sesalpinia\" is not most closely related to any of the genera in that tribe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Ion beam studies of materials\n\nIon beam studies of materials (also known as ion beam analysis or IBA) is a discipline that aims to determine the microstructure of solids. Ion beam studies of materials use mass spectrometry to study materials. Ion beam analysis is the name used for the techniques developed to study the solid materials with either a gas or a particle beam. Particle beams are commonly produced by ion guns or by secondary ion mass spectrometry. For high resolution, single particle mass spectrometry (called single particle IBA) or time of flight (TOF) instruments are employed. For many studies, electron microscopes can be used with appropriate detectors.\n\nSingle particle mass spectrometry was invented by Herb Guyer and Edward A. Heineman at Cornell University in 1953. This technique was the foundation of the field of ion beam analysis. This technique has been used to study a wide range of materials including metals, ceramics, glasses, organics and polymers.\n\nIn this technique the ion beam is focused to a small spot size on the sample, either by focusing in a magnetic or an electrostatic field or by being focused by electrostatic fields in a multielectrode system. The beam is then scanned over the surface of the sample. For each sample point, a mass spectrum of the sample material is obtained. The signals from the individual elements in the sample are then compared to each other in order to determine the composition and/or structure of the sample. This is because the signals are characteristic of the elements from which they are produced. The process of matching up the signals is called deconvolution. In this technique, the detector signal is measured only when a particle of the beam is detected.\n\nThe disadvantage of this technique is that it requires much more time to measure each sample point compared to scanning probe microscopes (which use electron beams).\n\nThe electron microscope with a detector attached to it can be used as an IBA tool. It is very useful to study the microstructure of ceramics and glasses.\n\nThe technique was developed at Cornell University and its name was coined by Thomas Vale in 1959. In electron microscope IBA, the sample is placed on a thin window and a beam of electrons is directed at it. The beam of electrons is either the electron beam itself or the secondary electron beam produced by a beam of primary electrons.\n\nWhen the electron beam is directed at the sample, some of the electrons are absorbed by the sample. This produces electrons inside the material and some ions. The ions are extracted by an electric field and are accelerated. The electrons emitted from the ions are detected. The detector may be a microchannel plate (MCP) detector or an electron multiplier.\n\nIn these systems the electron beam is accelerated between two plates. As"

The organisation was accused of losing sensitive personal data on more than 10 million people in an unencrypted CD in 2015, and was also accused of sending the wrong letters to half a million people.\n\nIt has also been criticised for a raid on the offices of investigative reporters at The Guardian.\n\nAn HMRC spokesperson said: ‘It has become clear that our compliance data is not fully comparable over time, and we will not be publishing it in this form again. This does not affect the overall tax gap and our published estimates of the tax gap for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 have not changed.’\n\nA statement on the HMRC website said that the data published on 31 August ‘estimated the total tax gap to be £33.2 billion for the year 2015-16. This figure represents a decrease of £4.7 billion on the 2014-15 tax gap of £38.9 billion, or a 14 per cent decrease’.\n\nBut it admitted that the figure included ‘incorrect estimates’ on income tax, VAT and customs duty.\n\n‘We have corrected this error and published revised estimates for income tax, VAT and customs duty. These estimates now estimate the total tax gap to be £39.5 billion for the year 2015-16, which is an increase of £4.3 billion on the 2014-15 tax gap of £35.2 billion,’ it said.\n\n‘This increase in the tax gap is not a true reflection of what has happened in compliance. It is because the 2015-16 estimates have included the correction of the error which has overstated the 2014-15 tax gap.’<|endoftext|>9 ATC ? What is an ATC and how do I use one? An ATC is an automatic transfer switch. It is used to transfer power to the boiler in the event of a power failure. These switches are \"automatic\" in the sense that they monitor the power flow through the generator and as soon as the power goes off, they engage the transfer switch (in parallel to the house breaker) to power the boiler. When the power is restored, the ATC turns off and disconnects the power to the boiler, restoring the house power. (We are not responsible for damages caused by not following these instructions). Before starting to install the system, you need to find the right place to put your ATC switch. Some considerations include: 1. You should put your ATC as close to the back of the generator as possible. This will make it easier for you to wire it up. 2. It is important to find a place that is dry. You can't use an ATC outside. It will just short out if it gets wet. 3. It needs to be in an accessible place (inside your home). It doesn't need to be near the breaker box (but it should be near a wall outlet). 4. The ATC should be installed at least 3 feet from the nearest source of water (sump pump, water heater, etc.) 5.

It has 2 to choose from; The Mad Tea Party by Lauren Child and Mary Poppins.\n\nI used the Victoria Plum and The Grey from the Victoria Plum fabric line.\n\nI found the bookmarks at a scrapbooking store and thought they were adorable.\n\nI wish I could remember where I found the quote, I think I searched Etsy and bought it there.\n\nI thought it would be cute to make little tags to put the names on so she could just hand them out.\n\nI love the bright colors on the back!\n\nThank you for looking!<|endoftext|>The original photographic image is composed of five photos stitched together with Photoshop.

How about better user experience? There are many ways you can accomplish both.\n\n1. Reduce your page’s load time\n\nGoogle uses the page load time as one of the factors when determining your search engine rankings. You can use PageSpeed Insights to measure the page load time for any URL.\n\nYou should aim for a score of 90/100 and lower. It’s worth pointing out that although this factor is being used as a ranking factor, a slow site will have a negative impact on user experience, which in turn will affect your brand image, search results, and conversions.\n\n2. Enable GZIP compression\n\nGZIP compression compresses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your web pages, which reduces the size of those files and the total data transferred to the user. Google uses this factor to determine page load time.\n\nPageSpeed Insights has a compression test that allows you to measure the level of compression achieved by your website.\n\nFor more information on how to enable GZIP compression, see this article.\n\n3. Enable HTTPS\n\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) allows websites to tell browsers to avoid interacting with any sites except the ones that use HTTPS. This is useful in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nAs of this writing, Google considers HTTPS as a ranking factor in its search algorithm.\n\nThe problem is that although enabling HTTPS is pretty easy (for WordPress websites), it’s not so easy when you have to replace all of your URLs with HTTPS URLs, and make sure that your backlinks are using HTTPS.\n\nIf you’re not ready to migrate, you can use the free tool from CloudFlare, which allows you to encrypt your WordPress website and even apply SSL to all of your images, making the switch to HTTPS easy and effective.\n\n4. Check your internal links\n\nInternal links are links that point to another page on your own website. Google uses these links to determine the value of the pages in your website, and how well your site is structured.\n\nLink-building specialists will tell you that there are a lot of ways to build good quality links.\n\nFor example, you can use social bookmarking sites, forums, and blogs. For links pointing to your website, you can ask friends, relatives, clients, and business partners to post links to your website on their websites.\n\nBut, you should do this within reason, and avoid looking like a link-building spammer.\n\n5. Include internal links in your blog posts\n\nYour blog posts should include internal links, to ensure that Google can detect the relationships between your posts. This will also improve your readers’ experience by allowing them to quickly find the posts that are most relevant to them.\n\n6. Create an XML sitemap\n\nAn XML sitemap is a page on your website that contains a list of all the URLs on your website. If you’ve been blogging for some time, you’ve probably already created a sitemap to allow search engines to crawl your site.\n\nThe problem is that search engines do not use the sitemap file on your website to crawl your website. In other words, sitemap file is useless to search engines.\n\nFortunately, there’s a free plugin from Yoast that can automatically generate an XML sitemap and also add the sitemap to your website.\n\n7. Install social sharing plugins\n\nSocial media is a great way to market your website and brand. Not only that, you can also use social media as a way to improve your search engine rankings.\n\nWhen you share your content on social media, you can make the content more accessible to your visitors. Not to mention the fact that social sharing plugins also provide users with a link to your content, which is great for SEO.\n\nSome of the best social sharing plugins for WordPress websites include Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter.\n\n8. Install and enable W3 Total Cache\n\nW3 Total Cache can greatly improve your website’s load speed by enabling caching for your website’s pages, posts, and images.\n\nYou can read my review of W3 Total Cache to learn more.\n\n9. Install and enable Yoast SEO\n\nYoast SEO allows you to configure your search engine settings for each post and page on your website. It’s the most powerful SEO plugin for WordPress.\n\nFor more information on how to configure Yoast SEO for optimal SEO, see my tutorial on SEO for WordPress.\n\n10. Install and configure Google XML Sitemaps\n\nThis is another free plugin from Google that generates an XML sitemap for your website. This sitemap will allow search engines to crawl your website faster and more efficiently.\n\nIt also helps you to build quality backlinks to your website. The links in the XML sitemap are much stronger than the links in your sitemap file, because they are permanent links.\n\nYou can read more about how to configure Google XML Sitemaps for optimal SEO.\n\n11. Install and enable Google Analytics\n\nGoogle Analytics is a free analytics tool from Google that lets you monitor your website’s performance, including the number of visitors you’re getting, where they’re coming from, and what they’re doing on your website.\n\nI have my own tutorial on how to configure Google Analytics for optimal SEO.\n\n12. Install and enable Google Webmaster Tools\n\nWebmaster Tools is another free tool from Google that lets you verify your website and configure a wide range of settings, including your preferred domain, how your website is indexed, what the canonical URLs are, whether you allow Google to crawl dynamic pages, whether you allow web crawlers to follow your links, and whether you allow Google to scan your pages for malware.\n\nWebmaster Tools is especially useful for websites that have a lot of dynamic pages, and pages that are indexed using non-standard URLs.\n\n13. Install and enable Google Analytics by Yoast\n\nGoogle Analytics by Yoast is another free plugin that allows you to synchronize your Google Analytics account with the most popular SEO plugin for WordPress, Yoast SEO.\n\nWith this plugin, you can easily add your Google Analytics tracking code to all your posts, pages, and sidebars, without having to manually add the tracking code for each post.\n\n14. Submit your website to Google\n\nIf you have a new website, you should submit it to Google Webmaster Tools, which will allow Google to index your website and create a site map.\n\n15. Install a contact form plugin"

These include retail shoppers who look to Amazon for new toys or appliances, travelers who look to Expedia for airline tickets, and even patients who look to the internet to learn about a disease or find a doctor. This presents unique challenges for brand owners. While brand owners can claim ownership of certain content on their sites and apps, much of the internet is controlled by other entities. This includes social media sites, search engines, content syndicators, content aggregators, and other web sites. A brand owner who does not protect its name and trademarks on these sites risks losing control of its brand online.\n\nIn the past, brand owners who found a third-party using its trademarks or similar trademarks had to prove that the third-party was using the mark in a confusing manner. This required proving that the third-party’s use of the mark was likely to cause confusion in the mind of the average consumer, i.e. that it was likely to be mistaken for the mark of the brand owner. Today, however, that burden of proof is no longer necessary.\n\nA little over one year ago, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided the landmark case of Global-Tech v. eBay, 562 F.3d 982 (9th Cir. 2009). The Global-Tech decision held that a plaintiff can bring a claim against a third-party for cybersquatting by using the new procedures set forth in the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 (“ACPA”). Previously, under the ACPA, a brand owner had to prove confusion to make a cybersquatting claim. Under the new regime, the burden has been placed on the third-party to show that its use of a domain name is legitimate.\n\nThe burden shift was the most significant change in the Global-Tech case. Before Global-Tech, a cybersquatting plaintiff had to prove confusion. After Global-Tech, a cybersquatting plaintiff only needs to prove that a defendant has registered a domain name similar to the plaintiff’s mark with bad faith intent to profit.\n\nAccording to the Ninth Circuit, “the ACPA’s [bad faith] requirement means little more than that a domain name registrant must intend to profit from the goodwill associated with the plaintiff’s mark.”\n\nOnce a cybersquatting plaintiff has proven this intent, a plaintiff need only show that it owns a trademark that is similar to the defendant’s domain name in order to prevail on its claim. This is the essence of the burden shift. A plaintiff who successfully proves that the defendant is cybersquatting on a domain name that is similar to its trademark does not need to prove that consumers are being confused. The cybersquatter must show that its use of the domain name is legitimate.\n\nThe Global-Tech case also made it easier for a plaintiff to win a cybersquatting case because of the additional burdens placed on a defendant.\n\nFirst, the Global-Tech case made it harder for a cybersquatting defendant to defend itself on the merits. Before Global-Tech, a defendant could defend a cybersquatting claim by arguing that its use of the domain name was not confusing to consumers. However, after Global-Tech, a defendant can no longer rely on its good faith use of the domain name to show that it is not cybersquatting. Instead, a defendant must show that its use of the mark is legitimate. This has led to claims of cybersquatting where the mark and the domain name are similar, but where there is no evidence that consumers are being confused.\n\nSecond, the Global-Tech case made it easier for a cybersquatting plaintiff to obtain injunctive relief. Traditionally, a cybersquatting plaintiff had to show that it was likely to prevail on its claim in order to obtain an injunction to prevent a defendant from using its domain name. After Global-Tech, a plaintiff need only show that the defendant is likely to profit from its use of the domain name to obtain an injunction. Since an injunction may be obtained before trial, this allows plaintiffs to eliminate the use of their marks by defendants before they can defend their actions in court.\n\nThe Global-Tech case has led to a shift in the burden of proof in cybersquatting cases. This shift has created an environment where cybersquatting cases are becoming more difficult to defend.<|endoftext|>Rated 5 out of 5 by Bullockie79 from The only thing better than this shirt is the price I’m a bigger guy and I like to buy shirts that fit my body.

I love conversations with guys about life, business, sex, sports and news.\n\n\n\nA friend of mine said, \"The best conversations happen over a good cup of coffee\".\n\n\n\nThat’s what I’ve done in my new book... ‘Good Coffee, Bad Conversations’.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve got a few minutes, I’d like to share a story with you.\n\n\n\nIn the late 90’s, my business partner, Jeff – a good friend of mine and also a barber – was having problems. He was having lots of conflict with his wife and daughter and he was angry all the time.\n\n\n\nI asked him if he wanted to talk about it.\n\n\n\nHe said, “No. That would be good coffee, bad conversation.”\n\n\n\nIt’s true, Jeff was scared to open up and share what was really going on in his life. He was afraid of what he would hear.\n\n\n\nI remember this time because I wanted to help Jeff, but I didn’t know what to do. So I did the only thing I knew how to do.\n\n\n\nI started writing.\n\n\n\nAs I wrote, I realized that coffee was a lot like conversation.\n\n\n\nA cup of coffee was good.\n\n\n\nA cup of coffee was bad.\n\n\n\nThat’s when it hit me... ‘Good Coffee, Bad Conversations’.\n\n\n\nIt’s about the conversations we have and how they can make or break our lives.\n\n\n\nIn my book, I show you the seven bad conversations you need to stop having.

"All the new games for the week\n\nOnce upon a time, the first week of the month meant a new Switch eShop release was imminent, but recently, Nintendo has shown an admirable level of restraint. The first week of this month is no different, as there's just a couple of new games on the way to the system's digital store.\n\nComing to North America this week is the sequel to the surprise hit of 2017, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap. The platformer has a rich history on the PC and consoles, but this remake proved to be well worth the time spent by the fans. With a new look and modern gameplay, this is certainly worth your time if you haven't played it yet. The Dragon's Trap releases in North America on February 9.\n\nFor our European readers, this week brings us into the dangerous world of SteamWorld Dig 2. While the first game was critically acclaimed and earned quite a bit of love, this sequel looks to improve on the formula by adding a lot more variety and some online multiplayer options. Dig 2 is a bit more than a week away, and will be available on February 9.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, then you'll be happy to know that the Nintendo Switch's Virtual Console service has something new in store for you. For the week of February 13, the Nintendo 64 classic Donkey Kong 64 will be available on the system's store.\n\nAs always, we'll keep an eye on the eShop and update you on new releases if and when they become available. If you're holding out for some new physical releases, we should have some news later today.\n\nThis article may contain links to online retail stores.

I had been really looking forward to it since I heard about it months ago. I enjoyed it a lot, but the final scene didn't end with the punch I was expecting. The entire movie was a quiet, intense build-up to that one final scene and, as much as I enjoyed the movie, I found myself disappointed at the end.\n\nThe film is good, I highly recommend it, but be ready for an intensely quiet movie. You might even want to bring a set of earplugs to help block out the noise from the rest of the theatre.\n\nSend comments to mike@mikeshea.net or follow @mshea on Twitter.

The device I am testing has a button which, when pressed, will alter the value of something between 1% and 100%. How can I find out what that value is? I know that it's 1% - 100%, but I want to know the value of the device and how it affects the outcome.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nMike\n\nIan Smith You need to identify what it is you are actually measuring.\n\n\n\nAre you measuring the current through a certain circuit? If so, you need to measure the voltage drop across it (and also the current through the circuit itself)\n\nAre you measuring the temperature of a thermocouple?\n\nAre you measuring the force produced by a tensile tester?\n\netc etc.\n\n\n\nThe only way to find out is to identify what is actually changing (when the button is pressed) and what is being measured.\n\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMikeJackness You need to identify what it is you are actually measuring.\n\n\n\nAre you measuring the current through a certain circuit? If so, you need to measure the voltage drop across it (and also the current through the circuit itself)\n\nAre you measuring the temperature of a thermocouple?\n\nAre you measuring the force produced by a tensile tester?\n\netc etc.\n\n\n\nThe only way to find out is to identify what is actually changing (when the button is pressed) and what is being measured.\n\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\n\nIt does help a lot, thank you. I'm looking at the values in the actual device rather than the sensor values.\n\n\n\nI'm trying to test a stepper motor, and I want to see if the resistance of the motor changes when it turns.\n\n\n\nI guess I'll have to figure out what the resistance is when the motor is not turning and what it is when it is, then identify the variables that affect it.\n\n\n\nAny more ideas would be great.\n\nIan Smith I'm trying to test a stepper motor, and I want to see if the resistance of the motor changes when it turns.\n\n\n\nAh! Well, you've gone and identified the system (stepper motor) and the variables (resistance). Now all you have to do is find out the actual resistance and how it changes when the motor is turned.\n\n\n\nAlso, have you determined whether the motor is powered from an AC mains supply or from a DC battery (or similar)? You need to know this because AC mains supplies may vary the current they provide, depending on the load (which may include the motor), and some DC supplies may have a current limit (which you may need to bypass if it's too low).\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nMikeJackness Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some reading and thinking about how to approach this, and it looks like my answer is to use two multimeters.\n\n\n\nOne to measure the voltage of the stepper motor (when turned) and the other to measure the current flowing through it (when turned).\n\n\n\nThe questions are;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of multimeter should I use?\n\nShould I use a panel mount multimeter for ease of use, or a DMM?\n\nShould I try to build a sensor for the current measurement?\n\nIan Smith Hi all,\n\nI've been doing some reading and thinking about how to approach this, and it looks like my answer is to use two multimeters.\n\n\n\nOne to measure the voltage of the stepper motor (when turned) and the other to measure the current flowing through it (when turned).\n\n\n\nThe questions are;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of multimeter should I use?\n\nShould I use a panel mount multimeter for ease of use, or a DMM?\n\nShould I try to build a sensor for the current measurement?\n\n\n\n1. Both, to begin with. You may only need one, but you may need two, and it's better to have two of them.\n\n\n\n2. As above. If you can't build the current measurement, then either use one of the basic models that has a current setting, or use the voltage reading on the meter and then calculate the current from that. (e.g. multiply by 0.6 to get approximate amperes)\n\n\n\n3. Again, as above. If you can't build a current measurement, then you can get a panel meter to do the job for you, or you can try one of the fancier meters that have current measurement as one of their functions.\n\nMikeJackness Thanks for the replies. I am currently using two multimeters, a panel meter and a handheld meter.\n\n\n\nI've built an adjustable resistance using one of the 5W, 12V heater elements from a microwave. When I put it in series with the motor it showed a resistance of around 400 Ohms.\n\n\n\nI was then trying to identify how much current it drew when it was switched on, and I couldn't get a good result because the panel meter wasn't reading it properly.\n\n\n\nI think that's where I'm at with it at the moment. I may try using my handheld multimeter to see if it can read the current draw, but that may prove difficult because I'm not sure where the current is going through the stepper.\n\n\n\nThanks again for all the advice.\n\nIan Smith Thanks for the replies.

Hyland has developed his own approach, based on a number of leading methods, to show the student how to apply them to language use. Divided into four parts, this book explores the key concepts, applications and findings of these methods, in the first section looking at language and discourse as a unit, in the second examining patterns of text structure, in the third explaining how discourse is used to construct particular kinds of meaning, and in the fourth looking at how we study discourse. The first three sections introduce three different approaches to discourse analysis - the macro-structural approaches of Saussure and Gee, the micro-structural approach of Halliday, and the interpersonal approaches of Brown and Hodge. The last section explores ways in which different kinds of discourse are studied, including conversation, literature, power, work and the media. What I liked: This is an excellent textbook. It provides a good survey of a range of discourses analysis approaches and provides clear descriptions of the methodological principles of these approaches. This is an approachable introduction to a complex and diverse field. The topics covered include the analysis of conversation, text and the various modes of literature. Hyland shows how the same principles can be applied to these different types of text. He draws on a wide range of literature to show how discourses can be studied and includes many examples of actual texts. The book is very clearly written, contains many well-chosen examples, and provides a good introduction to a subject which is likely to be of increasing interest to Linguists. What I didn't like: The chapter on the analysis of conversation and the chapter on the analysis of discourse in fictional texts would benefit from a more rigorous discussion of the key concepts used in this type of analysis. For example, the chapter on conversation provides an excellent introduction to this type of discourse, but it would be better if there was a clearer discussion of the concepts of turn-taking and overlap, and a more careful explanation of the use of 'look-back' studies and the main types of transcription. The chapter on discourse in fictional texts provides an introduction to a type of analysis which has not been covered elsewhere in the book, and this is an important addition to the text. However, this chapter does not include the discussion of the key concepts of discourse analysis which is provided in the other chapters. It would have been better if this chapter could have followed the same format as the other chapters, and discussed how a particular approach was developed, what its key concepts are, and how these concepts can be applied. I think that this is an important addition to the book. Another minor point is that there are several typos in the book, but I don't think that this detracts from the overall quality of the book. What is missing: A discussion of the key concepts of discourse analysis which can be applied to all types of text.<|endoftext|>Home Articles & Publications\n\nHOME ARTICLES & PUBLICATIONS\n\nFind out more about the Ark Community Foundation and our many achievements here.\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\nWHAT'S AHEAD\n\nSee what exciting events and programs the Ark Community Foundation is involved in this year!<|endoftext|>More than 600 students in the CSU system are waiting for their transcripts to be cleared.\n\nTranscripts at CSU campuses are frozen for over 600 students who attended the Pueblo campus last semester, and if they don't complete their credits and final exams, they could lose their scholarships and their seats.\n\nAccording to the CSU-Pueblo website, 615 students have not yet completed their spring semester. They will lose their financial aid eligibility if they don't finish.\n\n\"It's like they're on a waiting list,\" said Dale Lange, who works at the registrar's office. \"We're waiting for the teachers to grade their finals and the professor to submit the grades and then they can release the transcript.\"\n\nOn March 20, the Pueblo campus was told to cease instruction and close by the chancellor's office.\n\n\"It's just horrible,\" said CSU-Pueblo student Julea Prentice. \"I don't know if I'm graduating or not.\"\n\nPrentice said she's upset she's paying for classes that she can't use, but she feels she doesn't have a choice.\n\n\"If I want to go to graduate school I have to get a certain GPA, so I can't afford to fail this semester,\" said Prentice.\n\nMeanwhile, her son is suffering because he needs a caretaker for his medical condition.\n\n\"That's why I'm a mother, that's why I'm a mom, that's why I'm a father,\" said Prentice.\n\nPrentice said she feels alone and doesn't know what to do.\n\n\"If I don't have an answer, I can't do anything,\" said Prentice. \"I just have to wait.\"\n\nIt's a wait-and-see game for CSU students.\n\n\"I just hope we all pass,\" said Prentice.\n\nSome students, like Adrienne Longoria, have called out for help.\n\n\"Help us,\" she said. \"Help us students.\"\n\n\"We would have probably been able to catch up if they had let us finish our classes,\" said Longoria. \"It's just frustrating that they can't let us finish our last few weeks.\"\n\nLongoria and Prentice said they want to go to graduate school, but if they don't pass this semester, they could lose their scholarships.\n\n\"I'm trying to be hopeful,\" said Prentice.\n\n\"It's frustrating, but I don't know what to do,\" said Longoria. \"I'm hoping we get our money back and I'm hoping we can finish this semester.\"\n\nCSU-Pueblo officials said they don't know when transcripts will be released because each student's professor has to grade the final exams and send them to the registrar's office.<|endoftext|>Download jyrd.ptc.me Nude Selfies free porn video, hd xxx mobile porn.\n\nTorrentz will always love you.

When Lexus first introduced the current ES in 2006, the formula was right. But by 2012, it had become dated. The original ES was slow, thirsty and not very capable. The second generation added power and speed and was the first ES to tow. With the third generation, Lexus has taken that formula one step further and brought in all-wheel drive and a more refined driving experience. But it also kept the old formula.\n\nStyling\n\nThe 2014 Lexus ES shares its looks with the outgoing model and in a way with the new IS sedans as well. So it is a blend of a wedge shape and something more traditional. From some angles, it is vaguely reminiscent of the LFA. Its grille is pronounced, its side character lines are muscular and its curves on the hood and trunk are attractive and not overdone.\n\nIts front end is more Lexus-like than before and its tail is more sedan-like than before. It has a more modern look without being overly aggressive and its design is not overly bland like some of its competitors. It is a good looking sedan but it will be a little too plain for some people.\n\nTruck Trend's 2014 Best Interiors trophy went to the new Lexus ES. It has an attractive dash that has been borrowed from other Lexus models but it is still nice and functional.\n\nTechnology\n\nI was surprised at how good the 2014 ES was. It was comfortable and quick and the transmission was a work of art. It was easy"

Watch and learn!\n\nHow to make gourmet cakes from your home kitchen<|endoftext|>Did you think there’s no such thing as free lunch? Wrong!\n\nI was an old punk. I ate cheaply. I ate unhealthily. I went out for food once a week, never paid more than $8 for a plate of rice and 2 pieces of chicken. Other times I ate popcorn and French Fries with my friends while watching movies in the cinema. And as I became an adult, I ate badly and grew fat.\n\nLast year, I decided to change my life. I started to save money, and from that day, I stopped eating cheaply.\n\nHere are some tips I picked up.\n\n1. Choose the cheaper meal of the day\n\nMcDonalds have only 2 types of meals that are cheaper than the rest. These are the McD Snack Meal and McD Value Meals.\n\nThe McD Snack Meal cost RM5.69, which includes a Chicken McSpicy or Filet-O-Fish, 2 Nuggets and a 375ml soft drink. The McD Value Meal costs RM8.19, which includes a Big Mac, a McSpicy or a Filet-O-Fish, 2 Nuggets and a 375ml soft drink.\n\nBoth meals are cheaper than the other meals that you can buy.\n\nThe cheapest meal of the day in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal.\n\n2. Eat at ‘The’ Restaurant instead\n\nIn Singapore, McDonalds is known as ‘The’ Restaurant. And you don’t need to ask ‘Where is the nearest McDonalds?’, because in Singapore, ‘The’ Restaurant and McDonalds is the same thing.\n\nIt’s a myth that ‘The’ Restaurant is more expensive than McDonalds. In fact, most of the meals that are available in McDonalds can be found at ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nThe most expensive meal in ‘The’ Restaurant is the Set Dinner (Veg/Chicken). The meal costs $7.20. The most expensive meal in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal, which costs $4.29.\n\nAll other meals in ‘The’ Restaurant are cheaper than the other meals in McDonalds.\n\nFor example, the cheapest meal in ‘The’ Restaurant is the Curry Puff. The Curry Puff costs $3.10. The cheapest meal in McDonalds is the Cheeseburger meal, which costs $4.29.\n\n3. Eat from 7-Eleven instead\n\nThere are two reasons why I suggest you eat at 7-Eleven instead of McDonalds or ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nThe first reason is, the food at 7-Eleven is almost as good as the food in ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nThe second reason is, 7-Eleven sell drinks and fast food cheaper than McDonalds and ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nFor example, I ordered a portion of Mac and Cheese in 7-Eleven. I ordered the Mac and Cheese as a take away, because I do not have any microwave in my office.\n\nThe cost of the Mac and Cheese is $3.30. And I bought a Pineapple Juice, which costs $1.30.\n\nThe total cost of my meal is $4.60. The same meal costs $4.79 in McDonalds.\n\nIt’s true that the Mac and Cheese in 7-Eleven tastes a bit different from the one that I bought in McDonalds.\n\nIt’s also true that the taste is not as good as the one that I can buy in ‘The’ Restaurant.\n\nBut it’s true that the cost is almost the same.\n\n4. Avoid eating at the food court\n\nFood courts are expensive. The price of food sold at the food courts are almost the same as the cost of the same meal in a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo I’ll suggest you avoid eating at the food court.\n\n5. Make food at home\n\nI make sure I cook once a day. I try my best to cook healthy meals. And the cost of the food that I make at home is much cheaper than the cost of a fast food meal.\n\n6. Eat with other people\n\nThe total cost of my meal depends on how many people are eating the same meal.\n\nFor example, I shared a Big Mac meal with my friend. The total cost of the meal was $8.20. That’s because the meal cost $4.29 each.\n\nThe cost of the meal depends on how many people are eating the same meal. The cheaper meal is when I eat alone.\n\n7. Share the meal\n\nSometimes I share the meal with my partner. I usually share a meal with my partner once a week. I share the meal because I feel bad that my partner is eating alone while I’m eating with my friends.\n\nIf I share the meal with my partner, the total cost is $4.60.\n\nIf I eat alone, the total cost is $4.79.\n\n8. Always look for a promotion\n\nIn McDonalds, ‘The’ Restaurant and 7-Eleven, there are always promotions.\n\nFor example, 7-Eleven and ‘The’ Restaurant sometimes offer discount on their drinks and fast food.\n\nSo I suggest you always look for a promotion before buying a meal.<|endoftext|>HapWanderlust September 1, 2011, 8:10 pm it's a very interesting product...\n\nAnonymous September 3, 2011, 12:30 am Thanks for the review, very interesting product and its feature seems to be very promising.

(York University)\n\nWorkers discovered the roof of the arena had been built with \"soft\" steel, which is not as strong as the \"hard\" steel that is typically used for these types of projects, said Lenton.\n\nIn order to make sure the project is safe, crews need to rip out and rebuild about 50 per cent of the roof, at an estimated cost of $16 million.\n\n\"We’ve got to take this roof down,\" said Lenton.\n\n\"We will be replacing the steel — the beams — and re-engineering the entire roof structure, as well as all the supporting beams that support the roof.\"\n\nSchool officials say they will be applying for additional funding to cover the cost of the roof replacement.\n\n\"We will be going to the province for the additional funding that we will need, for sure,\" Lenton said.\n\nThey are also hoping to get money from the York University Foundation, which is a non-profit fundraising organization that operates separately from the university, according to its website.\n\nShe said she does not believe taxpayers will have to foot the bill for the additional cost.\n\nUnforeseen problems\n\nYork University president Rhonda Lenton says she does not believe taxpayers will have to cover the $16-million cost of rebuilding the roof. (CBC)\n\nThe problems do not end with the roof.\n\n\"We realized that there were some structural issues around the seating, and we’re replacing the seating, the wood seating in the arena,\" Lenton said.\n\nIn total, there will be 12 new levels added to the arena, along with a new heating and cooling system.\n\n\"I think, because of the complexity of this building, we have to anticipate what other unforeseen problems may come along,\" Lenton said.\n\nIn December 2015, school officials sent a memo to university faculty and staff outlining the potential for \"additional costs and associated risks\" that could arise in the future.\n\n\"We will continue to keep all our stakeholders updated as the project progresses and when we know more details about timing and scope of work,\" the memo said.\n\n\"I’m just waiting for more details,\" said Brian Lee, a York University professor and co-chair of the university’s Local 79 union.\n\nLee said he thinks the university should have been more specific about the challenges facing the project.\n\n\"There is no need for it to be kept secret,\" Lee said.\n\n\"There’s nothing secretive about construction projects.\"\n\nScheduling setback\n\nThe timeline for the completion of the project has been extended by more than a year, said Lenton.\n\nThe university had initially planned to have the arena ready by the 2017-2018 school year, but that deadline has been pushed back to the 2018-2019 school year.\n\n\"We did have an aggressive schedule. We have to replace a roof in a building that is up on a hill,\" Lenton said.\n\nLenton also said there will be more parking spaces at the arena once the project is complete. The university had to remove between 300 and 400 parking spaces in order to begin the work.\n\n\"I think we will have more spaces than we had before,\" Lenton said.<|endoftext|>October 19, 2015\n\nOnce again we find ourselves reflecting on our own good fortune as we consider the news from Paris. We are not only alive, but many of us have access to a wealth of luxury, both intellectual and material, that few of our ancestors would have dreamed of. And we also have access to media that have transformed the world. One of my sons recently discovered the fascinating series “How the Universe Works” (available on Netflix). This is a television show, with a high-tech production budget, and it is fascinating. It has some of the best images of the stars and planets ever produced, with an engaging story to go with them. The soundtrack alone is amazing. I highly recommend it. But it only works because of our technology, which has the power to tell stories across the globe.\n\nYou don’t have to leave the planet for science to reach you. It’s right there in your living room.\n\nToday I read a story in the paper about a study that examined the safety of exercise and high protein diets. This study was designed to answer a question that most of us have faced at some point: should I cut back on protein? My story pointed out that the study was very small and inconclusive, but the real story is about how we learn about our world and why this study is inconclusive. It is a story that has been repeated again and again. When new information comes out, we all read it with the same kind of judgment that you would apply to a restaurant: is this place worth my time and money? The more of it you eat, the more of it you want to read. When I read the story in the paper, I didn’t try to understand the process by which the authors made their conclusions. Instead, I simply had a gut reaction: was the story worth the cost of the information it contained?\n\nThat is the only real question that matters when we choose what to read. This question is especially important today because there is so much information out there. When the costs of information are low, it becomes much easier to consume, and with this abundance comes the difficulty of choosing what to read. So we focus on our gut. And this is because we have a brain designed to make these kinds of choices, one that is driven by emotional needs, not rational ones. We are not designed to rationally evaluate the content of each article, but instead we are designed to make emotional decisions about what to consume.\n\nThis point was well illustrated by some research done by scientists at the University of Michigan. They had two groups of subjects: one that was told to read a story that was fun and amusing, and one that was told to read a story that was sad. Then they had them make some choices about the food they would eat for the next week. The group that had been reading the sad story ate 25% fewer calories than the group that had been reading the amusing story. Why? Well, they thought that food was a reward, and since they had been unhappy in the experiment, they cut back on the number of rewards that they would give themselves. This is a very rational process, but the very fact that they were not looking at the process that led them to their choice means that it had to be some form of emotional response.\n\nIn this way, we respond to information much like we respond to food. Food provides us with energy and pleasure, so it is important to choose it well. So we think in terms of gut decisions, not because they are the best ones, but because they help us to cope with our lives. Information is also a source of energy and pleasure, and so we choose it as well.\n\nBut while we are creatures that make emotional choices about our food and information, we also have other needs. These are needs that were emphasized by the process of evolution: needs to know about the world and needs to know about ourselves. So when we read articles, or watch television, or go on social media, we need to know whether they provide this type of knowledge as well.\n\nMost of the time we are looking for a story that is interesting, and that will hold our attention. But we also want a story that tells us something about our world. The better the story is, the more likely we are to learn from it. A story about calories and exercise might not be particularly interesting, but it is important for us to know. A story about the stars and planets might be fascinating, but it doesn’t matter if it is a good story or not.\n\nThis is because we need information about our world to survive and to thrive, and we know this to be true because it is encoded in our DNA. Our brains have evolved to help us process the information that we receive, and so it makes sense that we"

This man is a type of “performer”, a type that is often put forward in business culture and in the literature of business leadership, and many men admire it and want to be seen as this type of man. It is the man who is never at a loss for words, and always knows exactly what to say, and is a good listener too. He has an instinctive understanding of people’s moods and emotions. He is the man with the plan. He knows what’s going on. He has a direct influence on others. He is never without a list of bullet-points, even if he’s just going into the shop. He’s good at handling pressure and he’s a team player. He is the man who is looked to for a reaction.\n\nYou can call this type of man many different things. I am going to call him a “business executive”, as it is most widely-used, but it is also a term that is rather different from the role of “business leader”, and which I will also address. I am a business executive, and I have been a business executive for as long as I can remember, and I’m a fairly typical example of a business executive. I think that most people reading this will find that it accurately describes at least a few men that they know.\n\nMost men aspire to this particular role. Some men even feel a burning need to play it. They will not be happy or feel satisfied in life unless they are in this particular role. They often judge themselves by it. They have a high level of need and drive to be a business executive.\n\nBeing a business executive is one of the “good” ways to be a man, it is one of the ways in which men “make a difference” and “have an impact”. It is also one of the ways in which men achieve “respect”, “respect” being an essential element in most men’s internal lives. Many men do feel that it is through this role that they will achieve respect, in the same way that they might feel that they achieve respect in the rest of their life. They might not be consciously aware of this, and they may have a lot of other reasons for doing what they do, but respect is there, and is an important part of their motivation.\n\nThis type of role is one of the ways in which men achieve success and status. It is also one of the ways in which they can “gain influence” and “change things”. It is the way that they “help people” and “change things” and “make a difference”. It is the way that men can “have a great career”, and achieve “success”, and “be respected”, and “make money”.\n\nIt is not necessary to believe that these are the only or even the most important reasons for having a job. In my experience, most people, male and female, care about these things to some degree or other. I am not attempting to persuade anyone that these are “unimportant” things, I am not setting out to denigrate them. But it is important to understand that these are reasons for working. People, both male and female, need these things, and it is to these needs that they often respond when asked why they work.\n\nBusiness executives often find it easy to get good work. Many people are happy to trust their judgement, because they are good at understanding the people around them, and they can provide answers to difficult questions. They often find it easy to get good work, and they may have a number of people to choose from when looking for a new job.\n\nThey often feel that they are “justified” and “have a right” to be in the position that they are in. They have earned it.\n\nThis type of role is very similar to that of “business leader”, but these are very different roles. Many people confuse them, and use them as synonyms, and they are often referred to as such in business literature and the popular media. They are not synonyms. They are two different roles, and their differences can be seen in the relationship of the people around them.\n\nThe business executive is a man who is often very popular and well-liked. He is a man who is often admired. He is often seen as the man to turn to for answers. People come to him to find out what is going on, and to find out what to do. He often knows what to say, and he has an instinctive understanding of people’s moods and emotions, and a quick and accurate understanding of the situations that he is faced with. He is a man who is often used by other people as a sounding-board, as a person to talk things over with, as a man to provide feedback and reaction.\n\nBut this is often not the case with the business leader. He often gets into trouble with the people around him, and he often gets an awkward response to his advice. He is not often looked to for feedback or reactions. He often does not feel that he has the understanding that he wants, and that he needs, and that he feels he deserves. He often feels that he is not looked to as much as he would like, and that people would turn to someone else if he were not there.\n\nThis type of role is the most important in a business organisation. It is not a role that most men can aspire to. In fact, I would say that most men do not aspire to it. And for many, if not most, men it is not a role that they can play well.\n\nFor many men, playing this role will lead them into unhappiness. They will feel frustrated and unhappy, and it is often a role that causes men to turn against the organisation that they are working for.\n\nMany men who try to be business executives will often find themselves in a difficult situation. Many men will find that they are working for organisations that do not have a business executive position. They will find that they are attempting to play a role that does not exist in the organisation that they are working for.\n\nMany men are unhappy when they try to be business executives. Many of them will be unhappy if they do not play that role.\n\nThere are, of course, many other types of men, and many other types of roles that they play. But this particular type of man and role is a very special one.\n\nA case study of a “business executive”\n\nThis is a man who is very good at his job, a very clever and able man, a man who has an instinctive understanding of people’s moods and emotions, and who has a natural ability to speak effectively and confidently to other people. He has a good understanding of other people, and he has an ability to work with other people. He understands other people’s motivations and he understands what is important to them. He has a good understanding of what people will do, what they will say, and what they will not say, and he understands what is going to happen and how things will turn out. He understands people’s moods and emotions. He is quick to understand how things are going to turn out, and he is quick to make decisions.\n\nThis man is a good communicator. He is the type of man who people turn to for reactions. He is the man who knows what to say, and who knows how to say it. He is good at dealing with difficult people, and he can handle difficult situations. He is good at explaining things to other people. He is good at handling pressure, he is good at dealing with crises, and he is good at giving people confidence.\n\nThis man has a good understanding of his organisation, and he has a good understanding of his work. He is often the man that people go to when they need information. He is the man who has a good overview of the situation.\n\nThis man has a good understanding of his organisation’s finances. He has a good understanding of his organisation’s future, and he can see things that other people cannot see. He is the man who knows what is going to happen. He is a man who has the answers, and a man who knows what to do. He has the information that other people need. He has an instinctive understanding of his organisation’s situation. He has a good overview of the situation. He is good at taking decisions.\n\nThis man can be effective at many things. He is good at working with other people. He is good at providing feedback. He is good at explaining things to people. He is good at providing support and comfort to people. He is good at listening to people and taking them seriously. He is good at convincing people. He is good at getting people to agree to things. He is good at persuading people. He is good at making plans. He is good at using his initiative. He is good at seeing what is going on. He is good at moving things forward.\n\nThis man is used to being respected, and he is used to people listening to him. He is used to being popular. He is used to having an influence on people.

For the status effect, see Poison\n\nFor the Hunter creature, see King black dragon\n\nVenom is a poisonous status effect inflicted by many creatures, and is inflicted by the dragon dagger special move. It deals low damage over time, reducing the player's defence level, and decreasing the effectiveness of protection prayers and similar effects. There is no venom available as a spell in RuneScape.\n\nWhen venom is applied, a timer of 16 seconds begins and the afflicted player receives the message \"You are beginning to feel venomous!\" This timer can be frozen using either an antipoison, or an antifire potion if the dragon dagger special attack is used against the player.\n\nContents show]\n\nSigns and symptoms Edit\n\nIf you get hit by poison, you may notice the following symptoms:\n\nInability to eat while venom is active (unless the player is using food that heals life points only)\n\nInability to cure poison with antipoison or heal poison using poison cures whilst the venom is active (unless the player is using antipoisons or super antipoisons)\n\nA decrease in defence level\n\nVenom damage Edit\n\nPoison has a poison damage value of 10 + 4 * n {\\displaystyle 10+4*n} , where n {\\displaystyle n} is the number of hits received. This means that the average damage of a venom hit is 22.5% higher than the hit's base damage. The maximum poison damage is 120 + 10 * n {\\displaystyle 120+10*n} , which occurs when the player is hit 16 times by venom.\n\nAs with other damage over time effects, poison damage is not affected by damage modifiers or protection prayers.\n\nResistance Edit\n\nThe player's resistance to venom is related to the player's Defence level, and reduces the damage done by venom accordingly. A player with level 90 Defence or higher will be almost immune to the venom of most dragons, while those with a lower Defence level will take considerable damage from even low-level dragons. The dragon dagger's special attack provides temporary immunity to poison from venom, however this immunity is lost when the dagger's special attack is used up, or if the player unequips the dagger.\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nEven though the Venom poison effect was not in RuneScape Classic, a poisoned player would say the same thing: \"I feel a little woozy...\"<|endoftext|>Wednesday:\n\nBrought two back, used one, but my power supply has burned out on the other one.

The capitulation of all German forces to the Allies was unconditional.The Reich Chancellery in Berlin was chosen for the signing. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had insisted on a place in Berlin, his army had reached the city ahead of the others, and he had expressed a wish to receive the capitulation in his capital. The same location had been used for the signing of the surrender of Germany by the Russian army in November 1918. The others present were the Soviet military commander Marshal Georgi Zhukov, U.S. General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, and British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, whose signatures appear at the bottom. This moment is often said to be the end of World War II, but is not the date used for official purposes. The terms of the surrender were finally worked out in Esen, on the river Mulde, between 24 and 27 April 1945, and approved by Eisenhower and Zhukov on 4 May. The official document (the text of which is in the final picture) was signed in Berlin in the evening of 8 May. It was ratified by the Soviet government on 1 September 1945 and by the other allies later.<|endoftext|>About “[Go]”\n\nDoo Wop–esque song by The Weeknd.\n\nIts sound is very similar to the 50s and 60s; therefore it is likely that this song would have been the introduction to The Weeknd’s debut mixtape, “House of Balloons.”\n\nThe song was written and produced by The Weeknd, with co-production by Doc McKinney and Illangelo.\n\nThe Weeknd has stated in several interviews that the song was written about one of his ex-girlfriends.<|endoftext|>\n\nSenator KROGER (Minister for Population and Immigration) (10:46 AM) —I seek leave to make a short statement.\n\n\n\nThe PRESIDENT —Leave is granted for one minute.\n\n\n\nSenator KROGER —The Leader of the Opposition indicated yesterday that he would be referring to the legal framework in relation to the privatisation of Telstra. This is not surprising given that the issue of Telstra was discussed at the last election and he has been a long-time supporter of privatisation.\n\nIt is interesting to note, though, that it is the opposition who have failed to produce their privatisation plan—not that they have one. And they have failed to produce it for one simple reason: it will have to meet with the ACCC guidelines in relation to Telstra. I was very happy to provide those guidelines to the opposition. I can provide them again this morning if they want.\n\n\n\nSenator Campbell —We know you are the legal supremo.\n\n\n\nThe PRESIDENT —Senator Krueger, on your own account, to get a bit of latitude—I think you have five minutes now.\n\n\n\nSenator KROGER —Thank you, Mr President. What I can do is provide them again this morning, but if the opposition has the same rhetoric it has used at the last election—and I know it is used at every election by the leader of the opposition—then it will fail to have its proposal examined in any great detail by the ACCC. It is not because we have an axe to grind, it is because the opposition have an axe to grind. But it does not pass the ACCC test, and it is interesting that they do not want to have that detailed examination of their proposal.\n\nLet us have a look at what Telstra said yesterday. The headline, of course, in the Australian Financial Review is ‘Telstra asks regulator to speed up broadband overhaul’. You would be very happy about that, Senator, wouldn’t you?\n\n\n\nSenator Campbell —We are.\n\n\n\nSenator KROGER —The point is that you have not said what the rates are. But if you had done your job in the last election and had produced your plan, then the ACCC would have had the option to have you examine your plan and to determine what the rates should be and whether they could be extended. What we have done is ensure that the interest of consumers and business in this country are protected. We have done it by putting in a position where the ACCC will have the opportunity to examine any privatisation proposal that the opposition has.\n\nAnd, Mr President, there are a number of aspects of Telstra that have been raised by the opposition. They are in the policy documents that the opposition are putting around. There is no doubt that those aspects of Telstra will be examined by the ACCC, as will be anything else they may have up their sleeve.<|endoftext|>This day started like any other.

In the Western world, the bat has for centuries, and for many people even today, been associated with negativity and danger.\n\nThe bat, on the other hand, is a highly empathetic creature. Bats have amazing social connections and perform complex rituals that ensure the welfare of their group members. They are amazing hunters of both insects and fruit, thanks to their very good eyesight and a large brain for processing data. Because of their social abilities and prey-catching skills, the bat has been hunted and killed.\n\nAccording to the Bats of Trinidad and Tobago website, “Since bats are prey for many animals, the loss of bat populations due to predation is widespread. Predatory birds and snakes, for example, may take a large number of bats from a colony.”\n\nI often wish for such care, consideration and connection when I’m interacting with other people. I often wonder what it would be like to have relationships built on respect, reciprocity and trust. My hope is that someday all the people in the world will connect with their hearts and brains, and practice empathetic responses to others.\n\nThough a long time ago, I have even heard the birds and bats say…\n\nCome on baby, light my fire.\n\nI wanna be burned, and baby, then you’ll desire.\n\nTo my readers, I’d like to introduce a new piece of music that I recorded on a ukulele.

He described them as \"friends\" who had \"brought calm\" to the region.\n\n\"This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil,\" Trump said, according to a White House pool report. \"If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing, then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil.\"\n\nIt's an evolution for Trump, who had attacked the trio of Middle East leaders during the campaign and, after he won, avoided being too complimentary about them.\n\nAnd in the days before his speech, Trump had been on the attack again against Qatar. He had bashed the Gulf country in a series of tweets for alleged \"funding of terrorism,\" which triggered the diplomatic rift. Trump went to Saudi Arabia on his first trip abroad as President.\n\nTrump has backed the Saudi-led boycott of Qatar and threatened \"severe punishment\" against Doha for its alleged \"sponsorship of terrorism,\" according to a Qatari official who spoke with CNN.\n\nTrump's comments about Salman and Faisal came just after he spoke about the Iran nuclear deal. Trump said it was an \"embarrassment to the United States\" and called it \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\"\n\nIt is also not the first time Trump has praised King Salman. After his inauguration, Trump made a phone call to the king. He called him a \"very wise person who wants to see things get much better rapidly\" and called their relationship \"extremely good.\"\n\nKing Salman was the first world leader to speak to Trump after he was inaugurated, and Salman joined Trump in a visit to a home in Riyadh that was built for families of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US.\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Faisal was assassinated in 1975.\n\nBut despite that history, Trump has only been complimentary about the Saudis, but not in the way some have accused him of being too cozy with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Saudis helped him create the first page in his Middle East policy.\n\nHe praised the Saudis after he won the election, saying, \"Saudi Arabia and I get along great.\" He had spoken about it as a campaign issue, saying in March 2016 that he \"would like to protect Saudi Arabia\" but that the country is \"going to have to help us economically\" in the fight against ISIS.\n\nTrump had also said in December 2015 that he was against the \"concept of bombing\" and was for a strong intelligence-gathering effort instead. He said then, \"It is a mistake to bomb the oil fields. You bomb the oil fields, you kill civilians, you destroy the oil fields. They are going to get into something else. They are going to produce and sell it someplace else. It will not be a pretty picture.\"\n\nAt the time, Trump was being accused of being naive about the region and for giving a nod to terrorists when he questioned whether the US should be spending money and lives to intervene in Syria.\n\nTrump has been criticized for appearing to blame Qatar for the current state of affairs in the region. Some, like the U.S. ambassador to Qatar, have said Trump is trying to improve ties with Qatar in order to fight terrorism.\n\nTrump also spoke during his visit to Saudi Arabia about his support for the monarchy.\n\n\"We are not here to lecture. We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership, based on shared interests and values,\" Trump said. \"We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership, based on shared interests and values.\"<|endoftext|>Photo: Courtney Marsh\n\nThe line to get into Drai’s Beach Club on Monday night stretched halfway around the block, which was a good thing.\n\nI don’t mind waiting in line for stuff.

"Dei aperti oggi dalla Regione Piemonte gli uffici per il trasferimento delle attività dalla Sic - Società Industria Costruzioni - al costituendo cda di Sistri - Sistema Territoriale della ricostruzione e riqualificazione idrogeologica, in sintesi una sorta di Anas dei Comuni. Le sezioni di Pinerolo, Chieri, Torino e Moncalieri sono state create per i cittadini in transito, anche se in questo momento non ci sono pendenze che li richiedono. La sede di Pinerolo è presso la sede di Regione Piemonte in via Monsignor Forno, 2, ma l'appuntamento è dalle ore 10 alle ore 13, dal lunedì al venerdì. Le altre saranno gestite da Bologna, dove in via Crispi al n.8 e via Mascagni n.6. Lo staff incaricato per la giornata di oggi prenderà i certificati in essere in Sic e, qualora non si tratti di ricostruzione, provvederà a stamperli in copia fotostatica, inserire nella pratica un modulo che costituirà richiesta di trasferimento e conservare la copia nei propri archivi. I cittadini in possesso del certificato in essere, o del sostitutivo del titolo abilitativo, dovranno recarsi nell'ufficio e presentare la pratica con copia dei documenti. Si potrà quindi ritirare l'atto compilato ed essere abilitati all'uso della nuova regolazione. Se la richiesta non è espressa per opere di ricostruzione, gli uffici provvederanno al trasferimento alla nuova amministrazione. Le varie competenze dei Comuni (ad esempio, le pavimentazioni, che hanno ottenuto una nuova regolazione della Regione) dovranno essere portate in una seconda fase, per i successivi trasferimenti. Si tratta, in tutti i casi, di interventi di adeguamento alla Legge Madia (230/2010), che non ha ancora recepito la normativa regionale del 2014, sulla riordino degli uffici comunali. Con le nuove modalità, non ci saranno più sezioni di competenza territoriale, ma saranno dei centralini di ambito regionale. In Regione ci saranno anche uffici \"complementari\", dove sarà possibile fare le pratiche per il reddito di cittadinanza, che dovranno poi essere trasferite all'ufficio dell'Inps.<|endoftext|>Anyone ever had a knot in their throat for 10 days straight?

On Saturday, Danny Garcia and Robert Guerrero will be fighting in the co-main event of the Alvarez-Kovalev undercard, and they are both in the top five of my pound-for-pound list. The winner of this fight will be the mandatory challenger to Keith Thurman for the WBC welterweight title.\n\nThis fight is just one example of how competitive boxing has been in recent years. There are so many great fighters that we could have one of the best years in boxing in recent memory. But before we go any further, let’s take a look at the four fights that were announced this past week.\n\nFor Alvarez-Kovalev, it was the best fight that could have been made at this time in boxing. In the beginning of 2015, the year started off great with Miguel Cotto vs. Canelo Alvarez, which was supposed to be one of the best fights of the year. But instead, it was a non-event and was a flop. Both fighters looked bad, and the fans were disappointed. That being said, the promoters realized that Cotto vs. Alvarez II would not do great numbers, so a rematch was out of the question.\n\nWith Cotto leaving Top Rank, there was a gaping hole in the middleweight division. Alvarez wanted to stay at 154 pounds, but the only option for him was to go up to 160 to fight the middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin. But with Golovkin only having one fight in 2016, and the third bout against Martin Murray in March, the timing could not have been any better for this fight.\n\nWhile the fight is taking place in Las Vegas, it should not hurt the Mexican fighter. The best fights involving Mexican fighters in Las Vegas have always been ones where the opponent is big in name and popularity. Alvarez has already faced Floyd Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Alfredo Angulo, James Kirkland and Miguel Cotto. He has had two pay-per-view fights in Las Vegas, and he has never been hurt by the size of the city or venue.\n\nAlvarez is favored to win this fight, but that could all change if he loses to Golovkin. For those that don’t know, boxing fans can be ruthless, and one loss can change everything. But in the end, the fans and the boxing industry will be the biggest winners in this fight.\n\nThen we move on to Lomachenko vs. Walters. These two fighters have two of the most awkward and beautiful styles in boxing. With Lomachenko being at 122, and Walters being at 130, this is a fight that could not be missed. Walters will be giving up eight pounds to the Ukrainian, but that is not a huge factor in this fight. Lomachenko is only about 1.5 inches shorter than Walters, and he is naturally taller.\n\nThe big difference between these two fighters is the lack of power by Walters. He has knocked out 34 out of his 35 opponents, but his most recent fight was against IBF super featherweight champion Miguel Berchelt. Walters could not KO Berchelt, and he lost a 12-round decision. Walters does not have a huge knockout percentage, and Lomachenko does not get knocked out. So it will be interesting to see how this fight plays out.\n\nThe fight that I am looking forward to the most is Garcia vs. Guerrero. These two fighters are very competitive in their division, and they are both in their prime. Garcia has already had two losses this year, but they were to Shawn Porter and Keith Thurman. Those two fights were competitive and competitive in style. But Garcia showed heart and talent in both of those fights.\n\nGuerrero is coming off of a very exciting win over Andre Berto in November. He was hurt several times in the fight, but he pulled out a split decision. Garcia is coming off of a draw with Porter in March, and he is currently ranked No. 3 by the WBC. While Guerrero is ranked No. 4, he has the ability to beat Garcia. Both fighters are fairly similar in style, and if Garcia is smart, he will win this fight.\n\nThe last fight is a big one: Nicholas Walters vs. Vasyl Lomachenko. I am hoping that this fight does not happen until 2018. The reason is because Lomachenko has a fight with Guillermo Rigondeaux on Dec. 9, and Walters is fighting in March. I want to see both fighters in top condition in this fight. With a possible date of April 28, 2018, it will give the fighters plenty of time to prepare.\n\nI believe that this fight could possibly happen before the end of the year. With Walters fighting on March 4 against Jason Sosa, and Lomachenko fighting on Dec. 9, it could set up this fight for the end of the year. Both fighters are on HBO, and the boxing industry will be happy if this fight takes place. Walters has already fought Lomachenko once in 2013, and Lomachenko is undefeated since that fight.\n\nThe only fight that I am looking forward to more than this one is GGG vs. Alvarez. But this is the second most anticipated fight of the year for me. Walters has proven that he can fight great fighters, but he has not faced anyone that could compare to Lomachenko. Walters was supposed to fight Miguel Marriaga on Nov. 26, but it was cancelled due to his weight.\n\nFor Lomachenko, he has had two tough fights against Guillermo Rigondeaux and Jason Sosa, and they have both been challenging fights for him. Lomachenko has fought great fighters such as Nicholas Walters, Gary Russell Jr., and Orlando Salido"

creature.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You are one of the villagers' pets, no?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: The closest village is east of here.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: And they keep you locked up, like an object?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: That is not right.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I will take you where you can run free.\n\nThe wolfdog barked and followed Ratonhnhaké:ton.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There, now.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Out of here, boy.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: We need to be quick.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Come on!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I have a plan, but I cannot do this alone.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You will help me, won't you?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I have a job for you.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good boy.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I am going to distract the guards.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You must go out the back door, and fetch help.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There are warriors who are eager to prove themselves.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: They are in the forest to the south.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Go now!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I'll distract them!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There's a way out this way!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What?\n\nThe wolfdog growled and rushed past Ratonhnhaké:ton.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Oh, well.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Guess I'm not alone after all.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: But we are two, and they are many!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: If you'll give us some cover, we can...\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (sighing) It was worth a try.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I'll hold them off, but you need to fetch help.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You remember the warriors in the forest, yes?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Go!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: No, you're not leaving me here!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You can come with me, or fetch help, but you are not leaving me here.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I have an escape route.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Follow me!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: The steps are there, come!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Come on!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What are you waiting for?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: A woman!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: How did she get in here?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Who is she?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Can she help us escape?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (startled) Is that you?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Are you a wolf?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What are you doing here?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: If you want to leave with me, we need to move!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: We need to be quick!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (giggling) You'll protect me, yes?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Yes, yes.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Oh, it's so dark!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There must be a way out!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There are, but I cannot see where they lead!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You could sniff them out.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good boy!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Oh, no!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: He's blocking our escape!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There has to be a way around!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Perhaps if we avoid him, we can escape!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: No!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Wait!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (sighing) They are everywhere!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I don't know if we can get out of here.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (startled) There are more of them!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (sighing) I do not think I can defeat them

Where are the warriors?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (growling) What is that sound?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: It is coming from above!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Is this the help you've brought?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (growling) No, it cannot be!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) That way!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I think the warriors have arrived!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) We need your help!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Come on!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: No, I said that way!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) Where are you going?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Come back!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: There is no need to be so rude!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Who are you?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (startled) A bear?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I had a wolf for a companion.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You can see him outside.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (surprised) Another dog?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: That one is not as friendly as yours.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: What are you doing here?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: How can you be here?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: They are ready to attack, you must distract them!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Good dog!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: He can help me, I just need to get him outside!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: I cannot leave without the other!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: Do not be a fool!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: He's too heavy!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: You have to help me.\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: (yelling) Leave him and go!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: It is too late!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: We are doomed!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: They're moving too fast!\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: How can you be so calm?\n\nRatonhnhaké:ton: They will kill us!"
"I remember the first time I saw Dazed and Confused. I didn't know what to expect, but it blew me away. As I was preparing to sit down with Richard Linklater to discuss his new film, I had that same feeling. How do you get an audience to empathize with characters they would normally write off as deplorable, if not outright despicable? We talked about this and more, along with the film's complex themes, which Linklater and his actors spent years developing. This interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nHugh: So what I'm really curious about, it's a little bit about tone. The last scene is going to be one of the most talked about, but there are lots of moments in the film where I don't think it's going to be easy to laugh. We're going to laugh, but it's going to be a complicated laugh. I want to know how you feel about that scene, and the importance of it being there, and what else is going to be the most talked about scene for people?\n\nRichard: You know what, I don't have a clue. I had a couple of moments. You know, I don't think it's anything like the rape scene. You know, that was one that everybody seemed to feel like the first time they saw it, at least in the audience screenings, there was a palpable kind of, \"Oh my god.\" But the bowling alley thing, we went through a couple of different iterations of it, and I thought the kids were just going to keep on throwing stuff at him, and he'd get up and leave, but no, that was the one that made people in the audience just go, \"I can't.\" I mean, I remember, I just think of, I have to confess that I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I remember some of the testing, because the movie tested a lot. And they always give you these cards, like \"what scene did you love, what scene did you hate,\" or whatever, and I was shocked by some of the things that people found totally inconsequential. You know, the whole detention room scene was almost universally praised. They loved that, they thought that was great, and the end of it, not so much.\n\nHugh: Yeah. The thing that's different about this film, obviously, is it's not only looking at people and their humanness. It's also looking at their flaws. I mean, you could write these guys off as total scumbags, but it's also very clear that they're young, and they're just trying to find their way. And that's what makes this so powerful.\n\nRichard: That was very intentional, and the fact that I had kids in the film, that was a choice that I made very consciously, because I wanted to get the perspective of the younger people who are looking at the world for the first time. And, you know, they don't have the same values that we do. They're different, and they don't realize it, but they are. They haven't been tested yet. And they're also kind of looking at, you know, maybe the judgmental generation that they have to become. So it was very conscious.\n\nHugh: So you're interested in their stories. What about the parents? I mean, you're going to be a parent soon, how has that changed the way you look at this film and the stories?\n\nRichard: I think it's made me even more interested in getting the stories right of the younger people, and being as honest as I can with them. I mean, I've thought about, I want to do a prequel, you know, like set in the '70s. I've thought about doing one that goes into the '90s, and then just getting closer and closer and closer to what it's like today, but really starting in the '70s and the '80s.\n\nHugh: It's a very complicated thing, and I know you've talked about this a lot, I mean, this idea of nostalgia. But I feel like there's a particular version of nostalgia that goes with this film. You know, you look at the sort of deep Americana in the film. I mean, how do you feel about that?\n\nRichard: Well, I guess I don't really know what you mean by that.\n\nHugh: It's this kind of very rich Americana that really looks at what life was like before people moved to the suburbs.\n\nRichard: Well, that was intentional, that was sort of the style of the film, but there were a lot of choices in the film, you know, that were very deliberate, and one was to make it as realistic as possible. You know, there was no comedy, there was no satire. I mean, it was really the intention, and one of the ideas that we were talking about was, how can you really make people identify with these people, if they're like, I mean, just people would say, \"Oh, they're just total scumbags,\" and that's not the intention. You know, it's like, how can you make people feel like this is a reality, and it's not a joke? And I guess that was one of the choices, you know, like that was just something that was a choice that we were very intentional about.\n\nHugh: What about you? How much do you want this film to be like the experience you remember, and how much do you want to add your own personal story into it?\n\nRichard: You know, I guess, I can remember the moment, it's hard to put into words, but it was, it was a really, it was a weird thing, I was in high school, and we were supposed to be staying at this place, and I was going to walk there. And I was, it was very late, it was like, after 10:00 at night, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I started walking, and I was like, you know, what the hell, you know? And I started walking, and I started walking, and I ended up in my bed, but I just had this sense of loneliness and alienation that I can't describe, but it was a very, it's kind of hard to put into words.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: So I think that's one of the things that was in the film, that's in all my films, but I think that was something that maybe people don't talk about. But it's, you know, the great teenage angst, that's like a rite of passage, you know, and I guess that was one of the ideas. I think that's what you mean by kind of a different nostalgia.\n\nHugh: Yeah, but I also wonder if it's almost more... It's like an explanation of the parents, of why they are who they are. You know, because I feel like, I mean, you're an independent filmmaker. You're not making a studio movie, but a lot of these people are making that decision because it's a career, but it's also that they're really starting to question their parents.\n\nRichard: That's a good point. Yeah, I mean, I guess that's probably true. But I'm not sure that the same characters would make the same choices. You know, it's a little bit different.\n\nHugh: That's true.\n\nRichard: So I mean, I guess there's probably a different way of looking at it, but I'm not sure.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: But that's probably true.\n\nHugh: One of the other things that I think is so powerful about the movie, is you can't really tell that they're all the same age.\n\nRichard: Right.\n\nHugh: You know, I think a lot of the time, especially in independent movies, you really can't, especially with characters who are supposed to be that age. But you really do a great job of putting that in there.\n\nRichard: You know, that was a real choice. The only choice that we did was when the girls are taking their bikini tops off, we did make them a little bit older than the guys, because the guys, they were mostly 18, and the girls, you know, they were 21, and they wanted to look that way, you know.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: I didn't want to deal with, you know, the issue of kids playing these kinds of roles, you know.\n\nHugh: Yeah.\n\nRichard: So, you know, that was one of the choices that we made, but other than that, you know, that was a choice that we made.\n\nHugh: You know, I can't help but think of the movies that inspired this. You know, I'm wondering if there are any that you feel like really influenced you, or you thought about as you were working on this.\n\nRichard: There were lots of movies, but I can't think of any specifically. But, you know, it was really one of the, like I said, it was really one of the influences was, you know, when I was a kid, and I watched all those movies, and I thought, \"Wow, I want to make movies that have this feel.\" And that's what I wanted to do, and when I say, \"this feel,\" I mean like, you know, I guess it's sort of the feel of early '70s films, but the cool thing about those films, they have their own feel, you know. I mean, they were different, and I"
"Dead Space is a popular sci-fi horror game franchise from Visceral Games and Electronic Arts. In addition to two sequels and several handheld spin-offs, the series also has an animated movie called Dead Space: Aftermath which was released in 2011. The movie is set between the events of Dead Space and Dead Space 2.\n\nThis week, we're looking at the movie's trailer and comparing it to its source material. I've played through the game and watched the movie and will be judging the trailer based on what was included in the movie. I'll only be judging the first 30 seconds of the trailer to get an idea of what to expect from the whole movie.\n\nThe trailer starts with a shot of the U.S.G Ishimura, the ship from Dead Space. In the game, the ship is overrun by the necromorphs and infested with scary creatures. The Ishimura's distress beacon is flashing, indicating it's under attack. However, the ship looks too clean to be infested. It's not enough to see the ship itself, you would have to see the dead bodies and monsters crawling around to get the idea.\n\nNext, we see a number of humans fleeing from something off-screen. In the game, they would be running from the necromorphs that have overrun the Ishimura. Unfortunately, they're all human beings in a space suit. You'd have to be pretty stupid to mistake that for the necromorphs. Plus, there's no one attacking the humans. In the game, there would be an endless amount of monsters chasing after the players. There wouldn't be a calm look to everything.\n\nThe next shot shows an exterior shot of the Ishimura while the camera rotates around it. Again, it's too clean to be infested.\n\nNext, we see a shot of some characters, all looking shocked. Again, there's no reason for this if it's not an infestation. It's a bit like seeing a normal-looking family in a horror movie. No one is scared. In fact, there's no real reason for them to be on the Ishimura, which is supposed to be an extremely dangerous place.\n\nThe next shot shows the captain of the Ishimura, Gibb, running up a long ramp. In the game, the Ishimura is more like a battle station than a ship, so the captain would be in the control room. We then see someone telling Gibb to \"get everyone out of here.\" This person has to be an important character from the game or a secondary character. But I'm guessing the person is Gibb's secretary. Again, there's no one yelling or crying. In fact, it seems like the only reason for them to be running around is because it's time to leave.\n\nThe last shot shows the Ishimura firing on something. It looks like they're firing at something, but it's a small target in the distance. The characters aren't running around like it's an emergency. It doesn't look like they're fighting a desperate battle. In fact, the trailer is too clean. All of the shots look like they were taken in a clean studio, not the remains of a space station.<|endoftext|>It is possible that you may not want your users to have the ability to make certain changes to the data that is being tracked. For example, you may want to track a list of servers, but you don't want your users to be able to add servers, remove servers, or make any other changes to the server list.\n\nThe answer to this problem is to use triggers. You can create triggers that run when a particular type of change is made to the data, and it is possible to make these triggers prevent the data from being changed.\n\nTo create a trigger, you can use the command-line function sqlt. For example, you could write a trigger that prevents a user from removing a particular field from the database.\n\nHere is an example of how you might create a trigger that prevents a user from removing the server_name field from the list of servers:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo CREATE TABLE ListOfServers(name TEXT); CREATE TABLE ListOfIPAddresses(ip_address TEXT); CREATE TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers FOR DELETE AS BEGIN RAISE INFO 'You may not delete the field server_name'; END; SELECT * FROM ListOfServers; name ---------- nameserver1 nameserver2 name ---------- nameserver1 name ---------- nameserver2\n\nThe SQL statement you would use to drop the trigger would look like this:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo DROP TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers; DROP TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers;\n\nNotice that we used the same SQL statement to create and drop the trigger. This is a powerful feature of SQL, which allows you to control exactly when a particular change will occur.\n\nFor example, if you want to remove the server_name field from the database, but you want to retain the data that has already been entered, you could write the trigger as follows:\n\nCREATE TRIGGER server_name_deletion_not_allowed ON ListOfServers FOR DELETE AS BEGIN RAISE INFO 'You may not delete the field server_name'; IF (@old.server_name <> @new.server_name) BEGIN INSERT INTO ListOfIPAddresses VALUES (@old.server_name, NULL); UPDATE ListOfServers SET server_name = NULL WHERE server_name = @old.server_name; END; END;\n\nYou would then delete the field, as follows:\n\n[mars@luna src]$ sql --user=alena --password=huh --default-access=READ --tables=ListOfServers,ListOfIPAddresses --echo DELETE server_name FROM ListOfServers; DELETE server_name FROM ListOfServers;\n\nThis example uses the triggers to prevent data from being deleted, but you can use triggers to make other changes as well. You can use the following table to help you determine which commands should be used to insert and delete information:\n\nSQL Command Insert Insert into table Insert into table columns Update Update table Update table columns Delete Delete table Delete table columns<|endoftext|>http://www.stangtv.com/shopping/listing.aspx?itemid=5806&catid=1314\n\n\n\nMy brother just bought this last night and said it is very nice.

But this year, things were different. In Apex 2017, he was defeated for the first time since 2015, eliminated in pools by a man that he once conquered: Samuel ‘Dabuz’ Buzby.\n\nThe question on the minds of many Smash fans was: Why did Dabuz defeat ZeRo, the player who has never been beaten in this game in tournament?\n\nWell, according to Dabuz himself, it was a relatively simple answer.\n\n“I can speak for myself, but one thing that I have definitely noticed is I’ve been playing with a controller for longer,” Dabuz said. “I was playing a lot with the Gamecube controller in 2012 and 2013, and he was mainly playing with the Wii U controller. That’s a big thing, and I think that in general I know how to read his tendencies a little bit better.”\n\nThe controller is a big factor because of the way that Smash for Wii U is played. Because the game was released on the Wii U, it is not played with a controller that has buttons like the PS4 controller, but rather a gamepad with a touchscreen.\n\nZeRo plays with a Gamecube controller with his right hand on the directional pad, and his left hand on the A and B buttons. Because of this, he has to learn the way he plays on that controller and how to switch to it from a standard Wii U gamepad. Dabuz, on the other hand, is more used to the standard controller, which requires more precision and speed to accomplish the same things.\n\nDabuz and ZeRo also play in different regions, which are played on different stages. For example, Dabuz plays on the East Coast, which has the Dream Land stage. This stage is the most neutral stage, and a player who has grown up on that stage would have an edge on a player who was more familiar with the other stages in the game.\n\nZeRo, on the other hand, plays on the West Coast, where the counterpick stages are often Dream Land 64 and Smashville. These stages can change the way a player plays, especially the super defensive style that ZeRo often employs.\n\nThere are also a few other things that can throw a player off their game, including the noises of the crowd and the pressure of being at the top. In a tournament where every person is trying to eliminate you, it can cause even the best to have a momentary lapse in focus and lose a match they should have won.\n\nThese are all things that have affected ZeRo, but they are things that he can get past. Because he is the best, the biggest target and a huge crowd favorite, it is unlikely that the crowd will stop cheering for him any time soon. And when he has a momentary lapse in focus, his playstyle is based around having more than one good option, and his tech skill is such that he can often do something even when he isn’t at his best.\n\nZeRo will be at CEO next week, and this is his chance to reclaim his title as best in the world.\n\nCover photo by Robert Paul via Twitter<|endoftext|>by Vincent\n\nOnePlus has officially released the Open Beta version of Android 9.0 Pie for the OnePlus 6.

"[In many cases, this book is available for \"slightly used\" prices at Amazon and the rest of the internet. I also offer this advice: if you find yourself using this book often, buy the paperback, not the hardback.]\n\n\n\nFor a one volume handbook of natural remedies and herbal medicine, I think this book offers quite a bit. The different herbal sections are separated out by area of the body with the body part followed by the particular ailment, i.e., heart disease is followed by the subhead heart disease and some of the suggestions are alfalfa, astragalus, and hawthorne. It also gives you the Latin name of the herb (or tree, or flower, etc) which is followed by a very detailed description of how the particular herb can be used in a variety of ways. You can also find the name in parentheses to the right. In this way, you can find an herb quickly in this volume that you may have heard of, but don't know exactly what it is used for or how to use it.\n\n\n\nI feel like the author offers some very useful information here, but unfortunately the descriptions are so brief that they can be confusing. It's hard to glean all of the information in the little boxes. I've come to rely on it as a resource when I don't have anything else to go on, but I also realize that it is a one-volume reference book and cannot be expected to cover everything. I like to have other books around for that purpose. This book does give a good foundation in herbal medicine, but I don't like using it as a primary resource in itself.<|endoftext|>L’Aquedotto\n\nL’Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto di Heidenheim\n\nIl primo lavoro che merita di essere considerato è l’Aquedotto di Heidenheim. Anche se in questo caso l’opera non è frutto di uno sforzo volontario e non aveva lo scopo di fornire acqua, ma ha come scopo principale la delimitazione del terreno (leggi il resto della notizia).\n\nL’Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto di Heidenheim (XI secolo) è una delle più importanti e affascinanti opere dell’architettura dell’epoca carolingia.\n\nLa costruzione dell’Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto di Heidenheim, cioè l’opera a cui si è qui riferito, avvenne durante il dominio dei vescovi e di cui il famoso Sisto di Heidenheim fu vescovo. Egli viene da una nobile famiglia e si laurea in teologia presso l’università di Parigi, dove acquisisce una grande dottrina.\n\nIn seguito egli torna alla sua città natale per occuparsi dei suoi affari, ma anche per prendersi cura dei suoi parrocchiani. Viene chiamato a prendere le redini del suo vescovado, allorché il precedente vescovo, eletto da Carlo Magno, viene accusato di simonia.\n\nIl vescovo Sisto diviene il successore del suo predecessore dopo esser stato eletto nel 1074. Sotto la sua guida il vescovado cresce e prospera notevolmente.\n\nLa dimostrazione più evidente di questo successo è la costruzione dell’Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto di Heidenheim, la cui costruzione ha inizio nel 1079, quando Sisto è vescovo, e termina nel 1092, quando cessa le sue funzioni come vescovo.\n\nAncora oggi si può ammirare questo famoso edificio lungo la strada che va da Heidenheim a Nördlingen. La sua lunghezza è di una trentina di chilometri, e il suo diametro di cinque metri.\n\nGli spunti di tale opera li ebbe il vescovo Sisto da tre guerre che furono combattute durante i suoi anni di vescovado, e che hanno luogo, la prima, nell’anno 1077 contro i Tedeschi, la seconda, contro i Bavari nel 1085, e la terza, ancora contro i Bavari, ma questa volta per la conquista della città di Bisanz nel 1092.\n\nIn conseguenza di questi attacchi, il vescovo Sisto fu costretto a rispettare un’astuta tattica militare e ad impiegarla nel campo della politica. Egli fu sempre sul chi vive per quanto riguarda la difesa dei confini del suo territorio.\n\nPer ottenere questo scopo, egli, appoggiato dal vescovo di Bamberga, costruì il più grande Aquedotto del suo tempo.\n\nSotto la guida del suo vescovo, il vescovo di Heidenheim, il vescovo di Bamberga ed il vescovo di Würzburg, si è provveduto ad avanzare verso i confini nordoccidentali, e i confini dei territori confinanti al nord e ad ovest.\n\nI lavori furono attuati nel campo militare, così come pure nell’ambito delle arti e delle scienze, perché il vescovo Sisto creò nel 1078 un’Accademia, a Heidenheim, in cui si studiavano le matematiche e l’astronomia.\n\nIl vescovo Sisto riuscì così a mettere fine alla sua missione e a trasformare Heidenheim in un centro per la conservazione della cultura.\n\nLa costruzione dell’Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto, avvenne attraverso un processo molto interessante. Anche se il vescovo Sisto non costruì l’Aquedotto, ma invece lo comprò e lo espropriò, egli, comunque, ne diresse la costruzione e con questo operì una grande opera.\n\nI lavori dell’Aquedotto del vescovo Sisto avvennero in due diverse fasi. La prima delle quali si ebbe tra l’anno 1079 e l’anno 1084, la seconda, tra l’anno 1085 e il 1092.\n\nI primi lavori iniziarono quando Sisto comprò e prese in esproprio una quantità considerevole di terreno, tra il suo vescovado, e il territorio che allora apparteneva a Würzburg. In conseguenza di questo acquisto, l’Aquedotto passò inoltre da Würzburg a Heidenheim.\n\nLe trattative che precedettero l’acquisto dell’Aquedotto non furono particolarmente facili, e Sisto si trovò nelle condizioni di dover impegnare molto denaro e cercare di ottenere il necessario appoggio anche nel campo militare.\n\nSisto, comunque, ebbe la capacità di perseguire il suo scopo, e di ottenere il suo Aquedotto, pur non potendo completare l’intero progetto, di cui egli, tuttavia, lavorò ad un livello rilevante.\n\nL’Aquedotto di Heidenheim è un monumento per la cultura, e una vera e propria meraviglia, così come lo fu, quindi, per il suo tempo. Oggi l’Aquedotto è ancora l’opera principale di un moderno vescovo, che di continuo, invece, esalta la sua coscienza della cultura di tale Aquedotto.<|endoftext|>The village of Oxford Falls, the largest suburb of the Northern Beaches, is nestled in the beautiful Ku-ring-gai National Park"

The city launched an investigation and suspended Fitzpatrick with pay in November, and he was demoted on Jan. 8.\n\nThe suspended firefighter and police said they were not aware of any criminal charges against Fitzpatrick.\n\n“We are investigating it and reviewing it internally,” Morrill said last month. “There is no further information at this time.”\n\nFitzpatrick, a Marine Corps veteran who has been with the Jersey City Fire Department for 13 years, said he is appealing his demotion and administrative leave.\n\nHe said he received a letter from the city in December saying his leave was the result of a “personnel matter,” but he said he has not been able to see the letter’s contents because it is sealed by the city’s law department.\n\n“They’re saying this is harassment and stalking, but I don’t know what else to do,” he said. “I just want to talk to her.”\n\nFitzpatrick said he met the firefighter while they were both in college, and the two became good friends. Fitzpatrick said he started sending her text messages in September because she had not returned his calls. He said he sent her messages out of concern that she was missing work because she was depressed.\n\nThe messages were more than once a day, he said, and he said he never threatened the woman.\n\nThe woman’s lawyer, Susan Ross, said last month that Fitzpatrick sent “more than 200 harassing and stalking text messages.”\n\n“The harassment has included threats to my client's life,” she said.\n\nRoss did not respond to a request for comment this week.\n\nFitzpatrick’s wife, Cheryl Fitzpatrick, said the situation has been difficult for their two young daughters, who know nothing about the accusations.\n\n“My husband is an outstanding fireman,” she said. “It has been very difficult on my children.”\n\nTerrence T.

"STOCKHOLM — In a Scandinavian twist to the final race of the series, American David Hargitt was awarded the North American Pro Kart Challenge championship over Canadian Fredrik Ekblom on Saturday night at Karlskoga Arena in Sweden.\n\nHargitt had an on-track confrontation with Ekblom earlier this season at Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium, during which Hargitt, now 28, ran into Ekblom, a now 18-year-old Canadian, with his kart, sending both into the barriers.\n\nBoth drivers were knocked out of the race.\n\nBut Hargitt ended the six-race season as the champion, his third overall series title and first since 2004. Hargitt and Ekblom finished with 107 and 96 points, respectively.\n\nHargitt finished first and second in the last two races to hold onto his lead. Ekblom won the first race of the year and finished third in the final race.\n\nDavid Hargitt, in a Pirelli factory-backed kart, and Ekblom, a Tony Kart factory driver, finished second and third behind series champion Thomas Preining.<|endoftext|>A man died Sunday in China’s western Xinjiang region after setting himself on fire outside a police station, a regional government spokesman said.\n\nThe man set himself ablaze after fighting with local police over a traffic fine, Nur Bekri, head of the regional government, told a press conference.\n\nPolice in the northwestern region were carrying out “stability maintenance work” at the time of the incident, he said.\n\n“He self-immolated after a quarrel over a traffic violation and the police station,” Bekri said, adding that the police handled the case correctly.\n\n“The government urges people to resolve their disputes through legal means,” he said.\n\nIn recent months, dozens of people have set themselves on fire in Xinjiang to protest what they say are human rights abuses, while scores more have resorted to violence or armed assaults against government officials or police stations.\n\nWhile official figures show that most of those who have set themselves on fire are Uyghur, a Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim ethnic group, a majority of those who carried out attacks were Han Chinese, according to reports.\n\nAn estimated 200 people died as a result of the self-immolations or violence last year.\n\n(AFP)\n\n网友评论：\n\n网易辽宁省阜新市手机网友：\n\nThis is nothing. In the most difficult time of the Cultural Revolution, more than a thousand people self-immolated themselves to death, over five million were violently killed, and an entire country was sacrificed for one man. The self-immolators are committing suicide for what? All of this is being sacrificed for a man.\n\n网易河北省廊坊市手机网友：\n\nSending military troops into Urumqi, letting people starve, shoot, slaughter, etc., the government has long since abandoned any kind of “maintenance of stability.” But can they face the fact that a few hundred Uyghurs have gone to extremes? This is the embarrassment of the government, a proof that the lives of the Uyghur are worth even less than the government thinks. I’m just hoping that the Uyghur people will gain their own freedom one day.\n\n网易广东省佛山市手机网友：\n\nTerrorism and arson.\n\nOnly a thief is afraid of fire.\n\nThe history of the burning of books in the East is the same as that of the burning of witches in the West.\n\nThe responsibility of the Uyghurs is in the hands of the government and the people of China.\n\nIf the people of China can be unified, if the government can be clear, it will not be as it is now, nor will it have the effects of spreading instability throughout the world.\n\n网易美国手机网友：\n\nThe most important thing in the Uyghurs’ lives is the love for their children and themselves, as the life of one’s family is the foundation of all things. This is how the Uyghurs are, and this is the reason why they fight back, and this is why they do what they do.\n\nFor example, the government forcibly inserts women into the Uyghur’s households and forces them to wear head scarves, it forcibly strips the children from their families and rears them in “orphanages,” forcibly rips young girls from their parents’ arms to be sent to Tibet, forcibly controls the number of children Uyghurs are allowed to have, forcibly forces Uyghurs to go to Han villages, forcibly encourages them to go to work in the cities, forcibly puts Han businesses into Uyghur homes, forcibly buys out their livestock and agricultural fields to build industrial parks, forcibly forces Uyghur young people to go to school to study and the rest are to go to do factory work, forcibly builds supermarkets, shops, hotels, etc., which gives them no chance to get employment, forcibly makes it so that Uyghur young people can’t find a spouse to get married and have children, forcibly demolishes their houses and forces them to move to another area, forcibly blocks them from having religious activities, etc., etc., the Uyghurs are continuously being forced to endure.\n\nIf you look at the Uyghur protests from a perspective of someone observing them, you can understand how it all began and why it has continued to this day.\n\nThe government has no choice but to take all this, because the Uyghurs are a minority group with nothing to back them up and their lot is really not the greatest.\n\nOn the other hand, if the government wants to go easy on the Uyghurs, this might also lead to the Uyghurs feeling discontent with the government, so it has to be a careful balancing act.\n\nYou know, because of this constant bickering, the government can no longer help the Uyghurs, because it’s already using all its energy to help the Han, which is what it cares about most.\n\n网易湖北省武汉市手机网友：\n\nIf the man really did self-immolate because of the fines, isn’t that a little too extreme? If he had used this method before, it could be understood. But he’s done this only now, this means that he’s only using this method for his own ends. What does this mean? How can people kill themselves and turn themselves into such an extreme protest against injustice? Who are the ones to blame?\n\n网易北京市手机网友：\n\nI am just trying to understand, he set himself on fire to fight over a traffic violation?\n\n网易美国手机网友：\n\nWhen the time comes, there will only be Uyghur resistance and nothing else.\n\n网易湖南省手机网友：\n\nJust look at this, everyone. The Uyghurs have their own methods of protest and methods of expressing their wishes and opinions, which have nothing to do with us.\n\nSo can we stop always picking on them and accusing them of terrorist actions? What they are doing is simply that they are using extreme methods to express their unhappiness and discontent, but I hope that they will consider the extreme actions of their people and act in accordance with the situation in China.\n\nI would like to ask everyone, what do you think?\n\nI believe the true thinking of the masses should be understood.\n\n网易陕西省手机网友：\n\nWhat a shame, they have this kind of personality and they’re so different from us. But since they are living under our government, and their lives are being constantly destroyed, I understand the psychology of people like this.<|endoftext|>Text & images Copyright (C) 2002 Jakub Maly.

(Quran 50:15)\n\nHindus consider the cow to be sacred. The Quran teaches us that it is not what enters the stomach that is impure but what comes out of the mouth.\n\nIn the Quran it is written as\n\n“God does not hold you responsible for your unintentional oaths. And He forgives you for any oaths you take to intentionally falsify something. (Quran-66:2)\n\nIt says that we should have absolute faith in God.\n\nIt says that the scholars are our friends and neighbors, that is why they must be obeyed and respected. (Quran- 4:71)\n\nOur God is one.\n\nIt is written in the Quran as\n\n“Those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Christians, and the Sabians – whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does righteous deeds – will have their reward with their Lord. (Quran 2:62)\n\nIt is also written in the Quran as\n\n“Indeed, the religion in the sight of God is Islam. (Quran 3:19)\n\nA Hindu must strive to become a better person and have patience, and trust in God.\n\nThe QURAN says as\n\n“And it is He who sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundation of the Book; and others not entirely clear. As for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation (suitable to them). And no one knows its [true] interpretation except God. But those firm in knowledge say, “We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.” And no one will be reminded except those of understanding. (Quran 3:7)\n\nWe must follow what is in the Quran and what was said by the Prophet (PBUH).\n\nWe can learn from all great men.\n\nIt is written in the Quran as\n\n“To you we sent the scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their low desires [to turn away] from the truth that has come to you. For each of you We have appointed a law and a way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a single community, but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to God; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which you dispute.” (Quran 5:48)\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” (Quran 5:3)\n\nHindus must believe in God and His Prophets.\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“The similitude of Jesus before God is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: “Be”. And he was. The truth is from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.” (Quran 3:59)\n\nHindus must believe in the Quran and what it says.\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“And We have sent down to you the book explaining all things, a guide, mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted.” (Quran 16:89)\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“If only they had stood fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord, they would have enjoyed happiness from every side. There is from among them a party on the right course; but many of them follow a course that is evil.” (Quran 5:66)\n\nHindus should follow their great men like Krishna and Mahavir.\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus – to establish the religion and not be divided therein. Difficult for those who associate others with God is that to which you invite them. God chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].” (Quran 42:13)\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“You [true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah (legal ways, etc.)] are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in God.” (Quran 3:110)\n\nMuslims are to call people to follow the path of the right.\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“We have sent you forth as a witness, as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, as well as to give mercy.” (Quran 34:28)\n\nMuslims must follow the truth.\n\nIt is written in the Quran as\n\n“You shall be on the right course, as long as you are firm and mindful of God.” (Quran 2:110)\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“You [true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah (legal ways, etc.)] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in God.” (Quran 3:110)\n\nThe Hindus must follow the truth and must not take the path of falsehood.\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“You will certainly be tested in your possessions and in yourselves. And you will certainly hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with God much abuse. But if you are patient and fear God – indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of determination.” (Quran 3:186)\n\nThe Hindu should seek the guidance of God.\n\nThe Quran says as\n\n“Is it not to God that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for protectors other than God (say): “We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to God.” Truly God will judge between them in that wherein they differ. But God guides not such as are false and ungrateful.” (Quran 16:72)\n\nThe Hindu should follow the teachings of the Quran.\n\nIt is written in the Quran as\n\n“Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in God hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And God heareth and knoweth all things.” (Quran 2:256)\n\nHindus should also keep away from alcohol and gambling.\n\nIt is written in the Quran as\n\n“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaitan’s (Satan) handiwork.

"Format: Mass Market Paperback\n\nI am a big fan of Julie Garwood. I have read and enjoyed all of her books. Most of her works have been historical romances. She is the queen of the historical romance. In her \"Garwoodesque\" style, she takes on a contemporary setting, but her attention to detail and superb research remains. If you've read her works in the past, you will find this new one to be in keeping with her other works.\n\n\n\nThe story takes place in modern day Scotland. Lucinda Ashton's family has had it rough for the past two years. Her father has been suffering from an incurable illness, her mother's nerves are beginning to show, and her twin brothers are both leaving for college and working part time jobs to help with the family expenses. But, it is her brother Duncan who she is most worried about. Duncan has always been her hero. The oldest and most handsome of the Ashton boys, she has watched him for years make the right choices and resist temptation. Lucinda wants to be a lawyer. But her parents are barely able to feed and cloth their five children, so Lucinda has had to abandon her dreams of higher education. Lucinda is determined to help her parents and her siblings. She will sell her beautiful pearl necklace so she can pay for her brothers' educations and alleviate some of her parents' financial burden.\n\n\n\nDuncan is thrilled to be going to university in Edinburgh. He is determined to study hard and make something of himself. When he discovers that his sister has sold her necklace, he is furious. But, Lucinda has already made the deal and there is nothing Duncan can do to stop it. Lucinda is devastated by Duncan's reaction to her choice. She is so hurt by his harshness that she stops speaking to him. Duncan is ashamed of his anger, and he is sorry for the pain he has caused his sister. His mother, a loving and kind woman, tells him to go to Lucinda and make things right.<|endoftext|>di Mara Polli\n\nÈ sceso sottotraccia, il Professore, perché ne aveva piene le scatole. E perché sostenere che la lezione di merda di quel giorno era solo la punta di un iceberg, un ritaglio di una realtà molto più vasta. In quel preciso momento, aveva preso coraggio, lo stesso coraggio che aveva avuto vent’anni prima, quando s’era inventato lo sciopero a sorpresa. Al posto del tran tran, era passato agli scioperi. Il primo, nel ’77, aveva avuto un riscontro difficile: un solo docente aveva appoggiato la sua iniziativa, ma la classe era nel complesso solidale con l’insegnante (sbagliato). Il secondo, invece, aveva attirato l’attenzione delle maestre. Quelle della prima e della seconda. E sì che aveva ragione: quello, per esempio, era il momento più duro, non solo per lui, ma anche per tutte le donne: l’8 marzo, avevano dovuto copiare i fogli per fare i mazzi di fiori (d’autunno, nel caso dei professori). Copiare i fogli, e lasciare l’edificio in ginocchio, a sguazzare nella scienza delle macchine. Ma il professore non sapeva come fosse l’8 marzo per le maestre. La maestra che la giornata l’aveva passata con la matita in bocca, che faceva finta di avere i minatori tra i denti. I minatori di turno. Quelli della prima e della seconda.\n\nLui, il professore, era sempre in bilico, ma in un modo o nell’altro ce l’aveva fatta, e questo gli bastava. Non avrebbe mai detto che tutte le donne svolgono un lavoro, alcune stanno al cesso, altre a cucire, altre stanno in sala operatoria, altre ancora passano a ritirare il pane o a farsi servire a tavola. Di tutte queste attività, lui avrebbe fatto a meno. Di tutte, e del lavoro in generale. Ma a volte è dura essere supereroi.

If it weren’t for the internet, people would not have any information about what is going on,” Mark Galeotti, Senior Researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague (Czech Republic) and an expert on Russian security services, told Sputnik.\n\nGaleotti pointed out that as Russia’s opposition leaders are being arrested or killed, the country’s media are totally “under the control of the Russian authorities.”\n\n“If you are critical of Putin, you are likely to disappear or be killed. There is no independent journalism,” he stressed.\n\nAt the same time, the academic stressed that “murder” should not be used in this case, as it is actually “a pre-meditated killing.”\n\n“It is a message to anybody else who might want to be critical, that there is no point in being outspoken,” Galeotti noted.\n\nSpeaking about the possible motives for Nemtsov’s murder, the academic suggested that there might have been a “spat” between the victim and the Russian authorities over the situation in Ukraine.\n\n“I can imagine that there was some sort of disagreement,” Galeotti said. “Nemtsov was an avowed liberal, who was pro-Western. He said that Putin’s policies in Ukraine were wrong.”\n\nThe Russian academic noted that Nemtsov could have been “brought into the public eye by some of the authorities who are opposed to Putin’s policies.”\n\n“I am not saying that Putin ordered the killing, but if you look at who is opposed to him, there are different people. Nemtsov was a figure of importance in the 1990s and in the early 2000s. So if you are trying to build up a coalition, you would bring Nemtsov back,” Galeotti noted.\n\nThe killing of Boris Nemtsov is “highly significant,” Galeotti said, adding that “not everybody is killed.”\n\n“The message is that there is no point in being outspoken. It is an effective silencer of anyone else who might want to be critical of the regime,” the academic concluded.<|endoftext|>Product Description\n\nThis packet contains a variety of great math stations for your students to practice addition and subtraction skills.

"The legacy of past security problems with GM vehicles has forced GM to recall more than 6 million vehicles over the past decade, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nGM made most of the recent recalls, including those for ignition switch and power steering problems.\n\nThe automaker will appear before Congress this week to answer questions about its handling of the ignition switch problem.

He was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Sinn Féin.\n\nErskine Hamilton Childers was born in England in 1870, the eldest son of Robert Erskine Childers, a British Army officer and later a writer and political theorist.\n\nIn the course of his lifetime he spelled his surname in a number of different ways, including Childers and Childs.\n\nChilders attended school at Stubbington House, Fareham. At the age of 16 he became a clerk in a Southampton shipping office. He joined the Liberal Party and became a political speaker on its behalf. In 1899 he was elected as a councillor to Southampton County Borough Council.\n\nHe married Molly Zichy-Woinarski (sister of Francis \"Frank\" Zichy-Woinarski) in 1908, but had no children.\n\nChilders was a keen yachtsman, and in 1906, with Sir Thomas Lipton, he set up the Shamrock IV syndicate to challenge for the Americas Cup.\n\nHe participated in the unsuccessful Irish Convention of 1917–1918, a body established by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George which negotiated an agreement with Irish representatives in an attempt to end the period of Irish nationalist insurrection. The Convention, which met at Dublin Castle, made a number of suggestions regarding the governance of Ireland, which were partially incorporated into the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It was Childers, who, in September 1917, raised the need for a \"conversation\" between Irish and British leaders.\n\nAfter the Easter Rising of 1916, and his arrest for involvement, Childers helped reorganise the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) in an effort to steer it towards constitutional activity and away from militancy.\n\nIn the 1918 general election, Childers stood as a Sinn Féin candidate in Wicklow. Although he did not win the seat, he polled well and the Sinn Féin party decided to nominate him as one of its members of the Irish delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. It was at the Paris Peace Conference that he met Arthur Griffith and became a convinced Irish republican.\n\nHe became a committed supporter of Arthur Griffith's Sinn Féin party. In 1919, he was arrested and charged with sedition, because of his support of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).\n\nHe was elected unopposed as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) to the 2nd Dáil at the 1921 elections for the Dublin Mid constituency. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, and became a member of the Irish Free State Seanad in 1922.\n\nHe became the fourth President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State (i.e. prime minister) in June 1921, and on 26 June 1921 he was appointed to the office of President of the Republic, (which was to become that of President of the Executive Council on the enactment of the 1922 Constitution in August 1922).\n\nIn 1921, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 split the island into two autonomous territories within the United Kingdom: the six north-eastern counties became Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland became Southern Ireland, governed by the Irish Free State government in Dublin. However, the Parliament of Northern Ireland chose to opt out of the Free State in 1922. Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, this meant that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State, but the British refused to accept this, saying it would lead to the \"break-up of the United Kingdom\". The Irish Taoiseach and President of the Executive Council (prime minister), W. T. Cosgrave, insisted that the British had breached the Treaty and that the Free State had the right to \"withdraw from the British Commonwealth of Nations\", but he chose not to use this option. Instead, he demanded that the Northern Ireland government do so, and thus abolish itself.\n\nChilders was shot dead in his home on Inishmore, Aran Islands, County Galway, in November 1922, two months after becoming President. The following January, the \"Irish Independent\" reported that Michael Noyk, the Russian Consul in Galway, and Joseph Murray, a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, were both implicated in his murder. The paper stated that Murray was sent by James O'Connor to warn Childers to stop political work in the Four Courts or else he would be killed, while Noyk knew of the plot and failed to notify the police. A police officer told the paper that he believed it was an ordinary robbery that \"went wrong\" as \"Childers was too tough a man to be robbed\".\n\n<|endoftext|>Sarah Williams (social worker)\n\nSarah \"Sally\" Williams (1880 – April 23, 1951) was an American social worker. Williams established herself as an activist, fighting for women's suffrage, juvenile delinquency, and public health. Williams was well known for her innovative and groundbreaking approaches to improving the quality of life for children, the public, and the underprivileged. Williams began working for the New York City Health Department in 1918, and in 1925 she became the director of the Bureau of Child Guidance. Williams was the only woman in the country with such a position at the time, and held the position until her death in 1951.\n\nSarah Williams was born in 1880 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second child of James Williams, a grocer and later a dentist, and Ella Burt Williams. At age 10, she attended the Powelton Avenue School in Philadelphia, and by age 12 she had already decided that she wanted to be a teacher. At age 13, Williams attended the Girls' High School and excelled academically. She took part in school plays and oratorical contests, and upon graduation, Williams attended Swarthmore College in 1896. Williams majored in Greek and Latin and continued to study oratorical contests and plays. After graduating in 1900, Williams continued her education at Cornell University, where she studied American History and Economics. While studying at Cornell, Williams became a member of the college women's debating team, which would later become a hobby for her. Upon graduation, Williams pursued graduate studies at Columbia University, where she received her M.A. degree in Social Science in 1907. At Columbia, Williams received one of her most important honors, the Demorest Fellowship. After graduation, Williams decided to enter the field of social work.\n\nAfter receiving her Master's Degree, Williams began to work as a social worker in Philadelphia.

They have no idea about cars, engines or aerodynamics, and in the end they will pay for it,\" team principal Peter Sauber said in a statement.\n\nF1 racing, one of the world's most lucrative sports, has for years been plagued by small teams on tight budgets. The sport's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone is trying to improve the situation and has created a fund, estimated to be worth up to $40 million, to support teams in dire straits.\n\n\"The idea of taking money from one and giving it to the other is not very positive,\" Sauber said. \"It creates the possibility of a new form of slavery. I do not think that anyone who worked in the factories during the war thought about whether a tank would end up being driven by a German or an Englishman. He was just happy to be making money. But people are not stupid, and there are some consequences that need to be considered. This is just crazy. It will never work.\"\n\nFerrari, BMW-Sauber, McLaren and Renault, four of the sport's top teams, have signed up to the initiative but Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said Sauber was missing the point.\n\n\"If the results of the championship are being hampered by an imbalanced distribution of resources, then there is a reason for the redistribution,\" he said.\n\nSauber's team have won 10 world championships but are among a number of outfits on the verge of going under as the sport's top teams spend millions of dollars in search of an elusive tenth title.<|endoftext|>Paladin\n\nA paladin is the sworn defender of a group of creatures, a good-aligned organization, or a person. Most are deeply religious, but the few who aren't still serve their groups or causes with fanatical zeal. The paladin is essentially a warrior of the gods, and most spend their lives wandering the world of Oerth, aiding those they deem good or just. Although a paladin will fight to slay a horde of monsters or a mad king, he will not do so out of a lust for battle or destruction, but out of a need to keep the forces of darkness at bay.\n\nPaladins are renowned for their bravery, their unyielding dedication to the principles of good, and their mastery of martial arms. It is rare to find an evil paladin.\n\nAbilities: Strength and Charisma are both prime requisites for a paladin. Strength is his prime requisite, followed by Charisma. Strength governs how hard a paladin can hit, how effectively he can wear armor, and his carrying capacity. Charisma governs the strength of his spells and the DC's of his class skills. A paladin must be lawful good.\n\nHit Die: d10\n\nStarting Age: Complex.\n\nStarting Gold: Complex.\n\nClass Skills\n\nThe paladin's class skills are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).\n\nSkill Points at First Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.\n\nSkill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.\n\nClass Features\n\nAll of the following are class features of the paladin.\n\nWeapon and Armor Proficiency: Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).\n\nAura of Good (Ex): The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.\n\nDetect Evil (Sp): At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.\n\nSmite Evil (Su): Once per day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the paladin adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the paladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.\n\nIn addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.\n\nThe smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: Paladin, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.\n\nDivine Grace (Su): At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.\n\nLay on Hands (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a paladin only needs one free hand to use this ability.\n\nAlternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.\n\nAura of Courage (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.\n\nDivine Health (Ex): At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.\n\nDivine Bond (Sp): Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a bond with her god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.\n\nThe first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level"

He represented Yarmouth in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1878 to 1882 as a Liberal-Conservative member.\n\nHe was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, the son of George Evans and Mary Ann Pritchard, and came to Nova Scotia with his parents in 1816. In 1833, Evans married Ann Squire. He taught school in Digby. Evans was a supporter of the Halifax Conservative Party. He served as deputy collector of customs at Yarmouth from 1843 to 1867 and in 1868 was elected to the provincial assembly. Evans was editor and publisher of the \"Yarmouth Herald\" from 1859 to 1870. He was elected speaker for the provincial assembly in 1882 but did not serve because he was ill.\n\nHis son George George Evans also served in the provincial assembly.\n<|endoftext|>Star of the Sea (disambiguation)\n\nStar of the Sea may refer to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Flavobacterium gilvum\n\nFlavobacterium gilvum is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped and non-spore-forming bacterium from the genus of \"Flavobacterium\" which has been isolated from sandy soil.\n\n \n<|endoftext|>Ariel Hernandez\n\nAriel Andrés Hernández Callejas (born 7 August 1995) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Deportivo Cali.\n\nHernandez's career began in the youth ranks of Envigado, prior to a move to Deportivo Cali.

Hernandez scored his first senior goal on 4 August 2015 in a 2–1 victory over Cúcuta Deportivo. The strike was his sixth of the season and proved to be the winner.\n<|endoftext|>Suspension (mechanical)\n\nIn mechanical engineering, suspension refers to a system of shock absorbers and springs designed to improve the ride quality of a vehicle or other types of machinery. It is an essential component in wheeled vehicles, providing a convenient way to deal with irregularities in the road surface.\n\nMost modern vehicles are fitted with some sort of suspension. It is the primary means of isolating the passengers from the road, as well as absorbing the bumps and vibrations from the road.\n\nThe suspension system on a vehicle provides the following functions:\n\nThere are many systems available that provide all or most of these functions, but most can be categorized by their design and motion characteristics.\n\nThe simplest suspension systems are rigid, and often called \"hard suspensions\", because they don't use any fluid damping. Instead, they rely entirely on the elasticity of the metal or the springiness of the suspension elements to soak up the bumps. Some early vehicles used torsion springs as suspension, but modern systems almost all use either coil or leaf springs, or shock absorbers.\n\nThe first and simplest suspension system was used by the French inventor of the wheel, Leonardo da Vinci. It consisted of four flexible limbs connected to the carriage. These limbs served as both the suspension and steering system.\n\nIn addition, Leonardo designed a system that included advanced features such as brake linings, bearings and a double-action brake system. A suspension system for cars was introduced by M. Thon in France in 1898. It consisted of a network of rubber bands that took the place of conventional springs. The rubber bands were enclosed in a conventional coil-spring housing. An advantage of this system was its light weight. Thon's design was introduced to the United States by John M. Curtis in 1904.\n\nBy the 1920s, many independent suspension manufacturers were using the pneumatic springing system as the basis of their systems, as well as using rubber or steel cords for springing. The principal disadvantage of the pneumatic system is that the spring-pressure increases with the compression of the suspension. In addition, a system that is not correctly adjusted will not ride well.\n\nThe third kind of suspension system was developed by the Morgan Motor Company, based in the UK. In this system, the spring is attached to the frame, and the shock absorbers are attached to a special hub, which attaches to the front and rear axles. This system is still sometimes seen in modern cars, since it is less expensive than the other systems and in most cases provides an adequate ride. This system has not been popular in Europe and North America since the 1930s.\n\nThe most common suspension system in modern cars, used in everything from Ford Model Ts to the Chevrolet Corvette, is the \"independent front suspension\", or \"live axle\". In this system, the suspension is a more or less conventional system of springs and shock absorbers, with the additional feature of a locating link (the king pin in an axle-based suspension). This allows the axle to move up and down relative to the chassis. The locating link ends are attached to the car body, which provides the rolling element to the system.\n\nThe other feature of this system is the axle, which provides the pivoting element of the suspension system. The wheel hub is attached to the ends of the axle, and the wheel itself is attached to the hub. The spring system, located in the body of the vehicle, is attached to the axle via the locating link. The body of the car, therefore, provides the \"pivot\" of the suspension.\n\nA number of variations on this design have been used, most notably independent rear suspension, in which the rear wheels are located by a trailing arm (a form of wishbone) instead of the traditional transverse leaf spring. Another design commonly found on trucks is the \"live rear axle\". In this system, the axle is located by an arm from the leaf spring. The rear wheels can move up and down relative to the chassis without any location from the body.\n\nA design commonly used on many racing cars and on some passenger cars is the DeDion or De Dion suspension, named after its inventors, the De Dion brothers. In this system, the two wheels are located by a triangular or \"semi-trapezoidal\" bar. The pivot is provided by a bearing block mounted to the car body, while the pivoting point for the wheels is a ball joint on the axle.\n\nThe DeDion design is an expensive design, due to the cost of the wheels, brakes and other parts. However, it does provide excellent wheel location, as the wheels can be moved by several inches in any direction without affecting the steering.\n\nRacing cars generally use the DeDion system, as the location of the wheels is the primary function of the suspension system. However, it is also used on a number of sports cars, including the Jaguar XK120, the Maserati 3500 GT and the Lamborghini Gallardo.\n\nOne of the main disadvantages of the DeDion suspension is that the front wheels are not located directly above the chassis, and there is significant scrub radius. For example, a wheelbase of 86 inches (218 cm) on a vehicle with a wheel diameter of 18 inches (46 cm) would produce a scrub radius of around 8 inches (20 cm). This can cause the car to steer and corner differently depending on the tire wear, since the scrub radius is at its largest when the tires are new.\n\nWhile an advantage of the DeDion system is that it is lighter than a comparable design, this is not a major consideration for racing cars. However, since racing cars are generally not driven at high speeds for long distances, the \"chassis bounce\" caused by the scrub radius is not an issue.\n\nOne of the first types of suspension system was introduced by Earle Crooker and was called \"Independent Coil Spring Suspension\". It was a brand name that existed only in the late 1920s. The name was used by C. G. Ames Co.\n\nIn this system, the springs are attached directly to the frame. In this system, the wheel is attached to the axle, which is supported by a bearing attached to the frame, not the car body.\n\nThe primary advantage of this system is the ease with which the wheelbase can be changed. In most cars, the wheels are located by a link that is attached to the axle and the frame, and the wheels can move relative to the car body. In this system, there is a much smaller length change, as the wheels move up and down relative to the axle.\n\nThe disadvantage of this system is that the body is no longer a \"pivot point\" for the suspension. The body is now part of the suspension system. This makes it very difficult to change the camber of the wheels (i.e., the angle of the wheel relative to the car body). In addition, the wheel can only move in one plane, as the upper control arm and the lower control arm limit the movement of the wheel. The car may need to be aligned more often, as the geometry of the suspension can change more than a suspension system where the wheels move relative to the body.\n\nThis system is commonly found on American cars built in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the Nash Ambassador, Hudson, and other brands. It is less commonly found on European cars, although it was used on some Mercedes-Benz models"

The aim of the project is to help these rough sleepers access the appropriate support services, whether it be residential or non-residential. The campaign highlights the issue of rough sleeping in Dublin city, which is rising at an alarming rate, with an increase of over 40% in the number of people living on the streets since 2013. The campaign’s focus is on raising awareness of this issue.\n\nThe campaign involves advertisements on the city’s LUAS and Dublin Bus, as well as featuring on O’Connell Street, Portobello and Talbot Streets. It also involves the installation of posters across the city, specifically in locations where the homeless are more likely to reside.\n\nSpeaking at the campaign launch, Minister Flanagan said: “Rough sleeping has reached record levels and has become a visible problem in our capital city. The launch of this campaign will increase awareness of the services provided by the Crosscare Pathways Project to rough sleepers, so that they are aware of the options available to them. Rough sleepers should be referred to the services that will best suit their needs. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am particularly concerned to ensure that rough sleepers are not penalised for begging and sleeping on the streets.\n\n“The Government is determined to prevent and reduce homelessness, to support rough sleepers to exit homelessness, and to prevent homelessness for others at risk. Over €70 million has been provided to support homeless services and prevent homelessness, which includes funding to frontline services such as the Crosscare Pathways Project, who work to prevent rough sleeping by providing outreach support to rough sleepers.”\n\nMinister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar said: “The ‘Living On The Streets’ campaign brings home the reality that the street is a harsh and unforgiving place to be, particularly during the winter months. The response from the public will be crucial if we are to address this problem effectively.\n\n“There are over 1,000 rough sleepers in Dublin city and unfortunately this is a significant increase on previous years. That is why it is so important that we engage the public, using this campaign as an opportunity to highlight the services available to rough sleepers, including the Crosscare Pathways Project. It is a complex problem that requires a complex response, involving a number of different organisations, as well as a societal change in attitude.\n\n“With the help of my colleague, Minister Flanagan, we have increased funding for the homeless to €70 million this year, which will provide more than 3,000 more beds in a wide variety of services. We have also agreed to provide an additional €5 million over the next two years.”\n\nCrosscare Pathways Project is a national organisation with local services based in Ballymun, Jobstown, Dublin city centre, Trim, Waterford and Wexford. It provides a range of services to homeless people and others at risk of homelessness, as well as people sleeping rough, particularly those sleeping on the streets of Dublin. The Crosscare Pathways Project also provides services for homeless people in Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin North, Dublin South and Dublin West.\n\nThe project’s services include outreach services, sleeping bags, socks, warm clothes, food, clothing, showers, laundry and toiletries.\n\nThe campaign is the work of the cross-agency Dublin Central Area Partnership (DCAP), which is comprised of An Garda Síochána, Dublin City Council, Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE), Dublin Fire Brigade, Dublin Regional Housing Executive (DRHE), Dublin Street Pastors, Homeless Hotline, Irish Red Cross, Samaritans, Simon Community and Street Reach.\n\nThe campaign is supported by a number of major partners including Dublin City Council, Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus, Dublin Airport Authority, Transdev and Luas Cross City.\n\nENDS<|endoftext|>During the war in Bosnia, in the capital city of Sarajevo, there was a hotel that was shelled repeatedly, and you could tell by the black marks on the facade which were caused by sniper fire and which were caused by shrapnel.\n\nHow do I know?

Some people may not have noticed the second fact. Over here, the NHS is now the NHS 2.0, or 3.0, or whatever they are on to. We’re getting used to the idea that it will always be changing, and changing in ways we’re not in total control of.\n\nWith my dry British sense of humor, I’ve always enjoyed the NHS. In fact, I like it so much that I even thought of emigrating to a country with an NHS – like, say, the USA. So what a treat to discover in my in-box this morning a compilation of jokes, half of them at the expense of the USA and half at the expense of the UK, about health-care reform.\n\nFrom London, Chris Salisbury compiled them, and here are a couple of samples. The first is about healthcare reform in the USA:\n\n“Have you heard about the new Congressional Health Care plan?”\n\n“Yeah, the government’s going to give you half of what it takes away.”\n\nAnd the second, about the NHS:\n\nA man is at the doctor’s office, and the doctor tells him, “I’ve got some good news and some bad news for you.”\n\nThe man says, “Well, I can’t take the bad news right now, so give me the good news first.”\n\nThe doctor says, “Well, the good news is that you have an 18-inch penis.”\n\nThe man looks stunned for a moment, and then asks, “What’s the bad news?”\n\nThe doctor says, “Your brain’s in your dick.”\n\nThese jokes may be inaccurate, of course. For example, the doctors’ pay packets are pretty great, and some of them can do much better work in the US than in Britain. But one thing I know is for sure: it’s great to see the NHS getting some serious attention in the American media. I bet it makes the doctors happy.<|endoftext|>Hello.\n\nI have been trying to download the RPM of a file that resides on a university FTP server.

Es zeigt die Interessen, aus denen sich die in der ersten Hälfte der Epoche gültigen Allianzen zwischen Reichswehr und Arbeiterschaft, den Kirchen, den Nazis und den Kapitalisten in der zweiten Hälfte zu so erstaunlich verschiedenen Gebilden wandelten.\n\n\n\n2\n\nDas Buch kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass der Rüstungsstaat, der heute aus der Weltkriegsgeneration stammt, sich schon in den letzten Jahren des Kaiserreichs vorbereitete und dass er nicht von der Weimarer Republik, sondern von dem inzwischen gescheiterten Gegner der Weimarer Republik konzipiert wurde.\n\n\n\n3\n\nEs schildert die Haltung des Kaisers und seines Adlatus Ebert zu der als Großmacht überlebenswichtigen Schwerindustrie und zu dem Staat, der seit 1871 für die industrielle Entwicklung garantiert hat.\n\n\n\n4\n\nEs stellt dar, wie und warum Hitler nicht auf einen Einmarsch in die Tschechoslowakei gefolgt ist und zeigt die Beweggründe für diese Entscheidung. Diese sind bis heute in der Diskussion über den Charakter des Nationalsozialismus vernachlässigt worden.\n\n\n\n5\n\nEs berichtet über die Zusammenarbeit von militärischer und ziviler Macht im Verwaltungsapparat der Wehrmacht während des zweiten Weltkriegs, von den Vorgängen im Inneren des Staatsapparats, der Gesellschaft und der Armee bis hin zum Prozess gegen die deutschen"
"Most of the novels I enjoy are focused on romance, in whatever form it may come. I believe that there’s something for everyone to enjoy, as the author does such a great job of portraying the characters in all their strengths and flaws. Sometimes they go a little over the top with the angst, and it isn’t very realistic, but I understand why. There are authors who never experience any type of conflict with their characters, and the books just feel very one dimensional. Some books can have some really crappy endings, but I have learned to stay away from books that end with the couple together and happy but someone was murdered or something along those lines. I don’t care for books that have the couple separated, but they’ll come back together in the end.\n\nWhat I want in a good romance book is a good, if not a great, ending that makes me feel good, no matter what happens to the characters. As I mentioned earlier, I don’t like books that end in tragedy, and they usually do end in tragedy. There are some that aren’t too tragic, but they just aren’t the endings that I like. This is where the author’s job becomes very difficult. They have to give the reader a reason to feel the way they want them to feel about the characters. If they feel bad, they’ve done their job. If they feel happy, they’ve done their job. As a reader, I’m not looking to be outraged, nor am I looking to be happy. I’m just looking for something that makes me feel.\n\nOn the flip side of that, I know a lot of people don’t want to be emotionally manipulated. They just want to read a book and enjoy it. They don’t want to be forced to feel one way or another. They want to feel neutral. Neutral, to me, is a huge accomplishment in a romance novel. To me, a romance novel has to be able to get a person, even if they don’t think it will, to feel something for the characters. In most books, people want to know how they can make a particular character do what they want them to do. In a romance novel, that’s the main character. They want to know how they can make the characters fall in love, because they see themselves in one or both of them. How would they do it? How would they fix it?\n\nThat is what a reader does when they read a romance novel. They want to know how to fix the problems that the characters have. This is why the ending is so important. It has to make the reader happy, but not to the point where they roll their eyes or feel like they were taken for a ride. I have a great example. In the movie Now and Then, a woman tells her daughter that she is happy. When her daughter tells her that she is, too, she tells her that it’s because they’re both lying. They don’t want to make each other sad, so they’re lying to each other. This is the exact thing that happens in a lot of romance novels, in my opinion. They’re trying to make the readers feel good, but in the process they’re lying. To me, the ending has to make the reader feel what the author was trying to make them feel, not what they want them to feel.\n\nI’m not saying that the book has to end the way I want it to. What I’m saying is that I want the author to be honest. I want them to give me a believable ending that isn’t just thrown together so that they can end the book. I want the ending to mean something, and I think that’s what most readers want. Most people like to be happy, and a good book will give them that. The ending has to be good enough that the reader doesn’t feel like they wasted their time, but also good enough that they’re not completely disappointed. They have to be happy with the story, even if it wasn’t exactly what they wanted.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite romance book endings?<|endoftext|>1) Running on behalf of a person\n\nThese dates are the running dates for campaigns on behalf of clients.

"The mainline of PC’s arrived on Friday in great shape. In addition to the newer No. 3 (blue) there was an earlier No. 4 (green), a No. 5, and two later No. 5’s. To fill the gaps between these 5’s I bought two…well, three…plows from another fellow who also had lots of couplers and castings. It’s good to have some of each for testing fit of things, but for permanent operation I’ll probably want to get a handful of No. 5’s.\n\nNow it’s back to finishing the minis and collecting the accessories. The insides of these last few cars could use some work, like fitting the walls for the corner curves. I’ll do that at the same time as adding the doors, and a couple of weeks should have them done. Once the house is done I’ll probably just keep building trains and cars for a while, rather than finishing the accessory set.\n\n-- Charlie M. \"Woodworking - patience = firewood\"<|endoftext|>To a certain extent, the goal of the Trump administration's trade policy, as explained in a speech given by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on March 1, is the creation of a \"reciprocal\" or \"two-way\" trading system in which all nations treat each other equally. While not naming China, the intended target of that policy was clear. The Chinese government, on the other hand, was not impressed.\n\nWriting in the English-language edition of China Daily on Monday, Ma Kai, vice-premier of the State Council, or China's cabinet, and chair of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), countered the Trump administration's position by arguing that China has been the most open to foreign investment in the world for the past three decades.\n\nIn Ma's view, China is playing by the rules of free trade. The problem is that the rules that America wants are not the same rules that America has been playing by. The United States wants to be able to sell its goods and services into China, but it wants to block Chinese goods and services from being sold in America.\n\nSpecifically, Ma pointed to the issue of the U.S. $347 billion trade deficit with China, which is the focus of a U.S. investigation to determine whether China's government has unfairly subsidized certain industries.\n\nBut China is not subsidizing its industries, according to Ma. The U.S. trade deficit is simply a function of America's industrial overcapacity and under-consumption, as well as Chinese market and regulatory restrictions on certain industries.\n\nIn Ma's view, there is an easy solution to the trade deficit, and that is to allow China to import more agricultural products, textiles, and auto parts from the United States.\n\nThis is not the first time Ma has been forced to explain the Chinese position in the ongoing trade war. Last week, he held an hour-long interview with Charlie Rose, the television host. In the interview, Ma also said that he would not criticize the Trump administration for the position it is taking. Instead, he is simply trying to point out to the Trump administration that it is China that has been working toward a free trade regime, and that the American government has not been as open as the Chinese government has been in allowing Chinese companies to invest in American businesses.\n\nWhat Ma is really doing is not simply trying to engage in a debate about the nature of free trade, but to make sure that Americans understand how the Chinese government is fighting to protect its own economy from the American tariffs, while at the same time, maintaining a narrative of the mutual benefits of free trade.\n\nMa's interview with Charlie Rose can be viewed here:<|endoftext|>WHY PEOPLE KEEP COMING BACK\n\nMany people come back again and again to our Salon.

China has been actively preparing for the summit and has invested in the improvement of its infrastructure and public services. However, the relationship between China and the US has deteriorated in the past few weeks. The US has asked the WTO to look into what it describes as unfair treatment of US companies in China. Furthermore, the EU, the US and Japan have called for retaliatory measures against China, after the announcement of a new Chinese law to allow China to bypass international patents. On the other hand, there are indications that the Chinese government will relax foreign ownership restrictions in its auto industry, and also encourage the outflow of capital from the country. The theme of the summit is \"Better Growth, Better World\", and the three themes will be \"growth\", \"inclusive growth\", and \"sustainable growth\".\n\nAccording to a recent report by the World Bank, China has a great economic potential, yet faces severe challenges. These challenges include maintaining the economic growth, the management of urbanisation, the fight against corruption, the increasing inequality and the aging population. On the other hand, the report also concludes that China has the opportunity to become a major contributor to global growth, thanks to the fact that China is an important producer of capital, the country is growing in the manufacturing sector, and is also important in terms of consumption, which is expected to grow by more than 6% this year. The report also highlights the fact that China has been the biggest contributor to the global GDP growth in the last 15 years, with a contribution of 30%.\n\nOn the other hand, China is also a top trading partner of the US, with trade between the two countries amounting to more than $600 billion. Therefore, the potential of a trade war between the US and China would be dramatic. As the leaders of the two countries are gathering in the same city, the G20 summit will be an opportunity to address many of the issues between the two countries. As an example, the summit will discuss the sustainability of trade, both for exports and imports.\n\nIt seems that the US and China may be heading towards a trade war. If such a trade war will occur, it will have devastating consequences on both the US and Chinese economies, as well as on the global economy. Furthermore, the WTO may face a severe problem, as it would probably have to be the court of the two parties involved in the trade war. Thus, the G20 summit will be an important meeting and will represent a key opportunity for the leaders of the two countries to reach an agreement.<|endoftext|>Culture and Tradition\n\nThe Sumerians, who were the first people to build cities, believed"

They've settled into their apartment, they're adjusting to working as a team, and even Chompy's finally feeling more like family than just another new roommate. They're finally back to their normal routine.\n\nExcept now, it's not.\n\nNow it's crazy.\n\nMax and Liz are supposed to be getting ready to take their first vacation in a very long time, but it turns out Liz isn't feeling up to it. She has a persistent cough, she's not sleeping well, and she's even started getting headaches. Max tries to be supportive as she talks about calling their doctor, but the more she says it, the more certain he becomes that something is seriously wrong.\n\nAnd then Liz stops talking. She won't talk to the doctor on the phone, she won't talk to Max, and she won't talk to the doctor when he comes to their apartment. She just smiles politely and lies to the doctor's face about how she's been feeling, and then makes Max drive her home as soon as the appointment is over.\n\nMax finally gets her to talk to him once they get home, but she can't tell him what's wrong. She just says that she's been feeling off, and doesn't know why. She refuses to go to the hospital, and eventually falls asleep on the couch, leaving Max alone to think about the phone call he has to make the next day.\n\nHe tells Hank, and his mind immediately goes to the worst case scenario. It doesn't help that when he went to visit Liz earlier, he saw a few of the guys from work lurking around outside their apartment. He had a feeling they weren't just paying him a social call.\n\nHe ends up calling Hank at two in the morning, rambling and stuttering and eventually saying it all in one long string of words. When he's done, Hank doesn't even need to tell him he was right.\n\nThe next day, Max wakes up to find Liz looking better than she has in weeks. There's a huge smile on her face, and she looks so happy. He's thrilled to see her finally feeling better, but he can't help but wonder if she's just hiding the fact that she's sicker than ever.\n\nHe can't bring himself to ask.\n\nShe starts working on her first assignment with a new partner a few days later. This new partner's name is Adam, and he seems like a pretty nice guy. Max watches Liz interact with him and can't help but wonder if he's doing the right thing by keeping her away from the wedding business. He knows how much she loves the job, and this is the first time he's seen her truly smile in a while.\n\nOf course, he doesn't get the chance to mention that to her. The moment he opens his mouth, she cuts him off and says she has a date with Adam.\n\nLiz goes on a date with Adam, and comes home late again. Max's heart sinks when she opens the door and he sees the smile on her face. It's not her usual smile, the one she saves for Max. It's the smile she reserves for Chompy and her art, and it's a smile he hasn't seen in a long time.\n\nMax knows what he's supposed to do, and he knows what's best for Liz. He knows that keeping her away from the wedding business is the best thing he can do for her. But he can't bring himself to do it.\n\nHe still isn't sure how she's going to take it when he tells her.\n\n\"Oh my god,\" she says, and Max's breath catches in his throat.\n\nHe doesn't get a chance to tell her that he's sorry.\n\nShe rushes off the bed and takes the two steps necessary to cross the room. She throws her arms around him, and Max's whole body tenses at the unexpected contact. He can feel her shaking in his arms, and the sound of her sobs echo through his apartment.\n\nShe tells him she loves him, and he tells her that he loves her too. She pulls away, and he can see the tears streaming down her face. She says that she has to go, and he knows he has to tell her what he did.\n\nHe knows she'll be angry with him, and he's not sure how she's going to react.\n\nShe kisses him on the cheek, and then disappears out the door.\n\nHe doesn't go after her.\n\nMax calls Liz the next day, and tells her to come over to his apartment. She's silent the entire drive, and he's not sure what she's going to do when she walks in.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he says, and she freezes in the middle of the living room.\n\n\"I have something to tell you,\" he says, \"and I'm going to need you to promise me that you'll stay calm.\"\n\nShe gives him a slow nod, and he knows she's not going to like what he's about to say.\n\n\"I called Hank, and I told him that you were sick. That's why you haven't been going to work. I told him that you needed to take some time off, because you had a really serious case of strep throat.\"\n\nShe opens her mouth to say something, but he interrupts her and keeps going.\n\n\"He didn't want to believe me at first, but I convinced him. I told him that it wasn't a big deal, but he needs to know if you start showing signs of weakness. He's going to call in a few days to check up on you. I told him you wouldn't answer your phone, and that's why he's calling here instead.\"\n\nHe sees the expression on her face, and he knows it's time to tell her the truth.\n\n\"You're really sick, aren't you?\" she asks.\n\nHe nods.\n\n\"How sick?\" she asks, and he knows this is the moment he's been dreading.\n\n\"Very sick,\" he says, \"It's Hodgkin's lymphoma. And it's probably already in your lungs.\"\n\n\"When did you find out?\" she asks, and Max can't stand to look at her. He turns away, and he's silent for a few moments.\n\n\"I knew as soon as we got home,\" he says, and she goes completely still.\n\n\"Max,\" she says, and he turns around.\n\n\"I was afraid,\" he says.\n\n\"You didn't have any right,\" she says, and he can see the tears in her eyes.\n\n\"It was a bad idea,\" he says, \"I know it was a bad idea.\"\n\n\"What about me?\" she asks, and he knows what she's asking.\n\n\"You have to promise me that you'll stay out of the wedding business for a while,\" he says, \"I can't risk you getting hurt.\"\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n\"You can't stop me from doing this,\" she says.\n\n\"Liz,\" he says, and his voice cracks.\n\n\"I'm not giving up on my dream, Max,\" she says.\n\n\"It's not a dream,\" he says, \"It's your life. It's your job, and I can't risk you getting hurt.\"\n\nShe shakes her head again.\n\n\"You can't tell me what to do,\" she says.\n\n\"I can and I will,\" he says.\n\n\"We're not a team,\" she says, \"We're not the Millers.\"\n\n\"You're not the Miller,\" he says.\n\n\"No,\" she says, \"I'm the Keller.\"\n\nHe's never seen her like this before, and he realizes she's not going to let him stop her.\n\n\"I'm doing this,\" she says.\n\n\"No, you're not,\" he says, and he can see the fire in her eyes.\n\n\"Don't tell me no,\" she says, \"Don't tell me I can't do this.\"\n\n\"I'm not telling you that,\" he says, \"You're going to do this, no matter what I say.\"\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n\"I can't stop you,\" he says, \"I know I can't. I'm not going to force you to do anything, but I am going to ask you to think about what you're doing.\"\n\nShe just stares at him.\n\n\"You're not going to stop, are you?\" he asks.\n\nShe shakes her head, and then walks out the door.\n\nLiz calls Max from work a few days later.\n\n\"Why did you do it?\" she asks.\n\n\"I thought I was doing the right thing,\" he says.\n\n\"I don't want to be a burden to you,\" she says.\n\n\"I thought you were sick,\" he says, \"I was just trying to help.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she says, \"And I appreciate it. It's just…I'm not really sick. At least, not anymore.\"\n"
"In this section we describe and analyze the effects of different problems on the model performance. In particular we consider the following problems: the serial position effect, the order effect, the semantic (in)sensitivity, and the distance effect.\n\nFigure 6.16 shows an example of text results of three sequences of three sentences. The whole process of filling and querying a WBS model is shown in Figure 6.17.\n\nWe can observe that in all three sequences the first sentence (“A citizen of A is driving a car”) is more frequently retrieved than the second sentence (“A citizen of B is driving a car”). The number of retentions for the first sentence is also higher than the number of retrievals for the second sentence, which can be attributed to the lexical and syntactic differences between these two sentences.\n\nAnother common problem in short sentences is the inter-sentence association: if a WBS model is designed to store sentences and not words, then the grammatical order of the sentences is kept in the model. Thus, the sentences that have the same word but a different order in the two sentences will be retrieved as if they had the same word. Figure 6.18 shows an example of sentences with the same words but a different order. As expected, the same sentences will have a higher number of retentions than the same words in the same order.\n\nThe serial position effect can be observed when words that occur in a specific position in the sentences are more retrieved than the same words that occur in different positions. This effect can be attributed to the influence of the semantic context on the recognition of the words that are at the same position in different sentences, and the words that are not in the same position have a different semantic context that makes them not to be recognized as if they were in the same position. Figure 6.19 shows an example of sentences with the same words in the same order but with a different position in each sentence. In this example, the word “of” in the position 5 of the first sentence is more retrieved than the same word in the position 7 of the second sentence, and the word “of” in the position 3 of the second sentence is more retrieved than the same word in the position 6 of the third sentence. This effect is more noticeable when the word “of” is repeated.\n\nIn this section, we present the results of a search on the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) [44] with the retrieved words and their respective sentences in a sentence. For each sentence, the average of the values of the retrieval frequencies for all the words in the sentence is computed. We show in Figure 6.20 the relative frequencies of the average values for each word-type for all the sentences of the corpus.<|endoftext|>In two years, after graduating with a master's in fine arts, he would do what he was paid to do: act in a studio's movies.\n\nBut then in the late 1960's, \"you couldn't see any kind of independent films,\" he said. \"We had two major studios, MGM and RKO. The independents didn't get a chance.\"\n\nSo he decided to make one of his own. After asking students at the graduate film program of the New York University Film School for help, he gathered friends and shot his first film, \"Mr. Mom,\" about a laid-off advertising executive who becomes a housewife, in 1970.\n\nThe low-budget, independent film, directed by a woman and starring a cast of talented newcomers, was ahead of its time. Many viewers laughed, he said, at the notion of a housewife as a career woman.

But she was interested in Mr. Moore's films, especially \"Slackness,\" which came out in 1981. She asked if he would like to work on a screenplay she was writing. He agreed.\n\n\"I thought this was a possibility to get out of the mess I was in,\" he said. \"It was a partnership. I had a chance to work on a screenplay with her. And she had a chance to write something. And then we got married.\"\n\nThey met in 1983. A year later they married and went on to make several more films.\n\nMr. Moore said that he and Ms. Chase had a very \"civilized\" divorce after 23 years. \"We've been married long enough that we have two children who are married, who are professionals,\" he said. \"They're both people who are not into the entertainment business. So they're good children.\"\n\nMr. Moore also has two other children. He did not see his first wife, Kay, and their children after they divorced in 1973.\n\n\"I didn't find it productive to go back into my son's life,\" he said. \"I didn't want to be a hero and make up.

He was 15 of 19 passing with no interceptions and no sacks against a second-team defense. He said after practice that he would play against the Titans if the game were today.\n\n\"It's great, it's great,\" Sanchez said of his arm strength. \"The most important thing with an injury is to get the strength back. We're seeing good results of that. ... That's the main thing.\"\n\nThe Jets quarterback was injured in the second quarter of Sunday's 24-17 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, and rookie Greg McElroy came off the bench and played well in relief. McElroy completed 13 of 19 passes for 153 yards and a touchdown and was sacked twice.\n\nSanchez said it's not hard to prepare to play in his first game since the injury.\n\n\"This is the first week I'm really getting to throw a lot,\" he said. \"I've got to get back into a rhythm. That's what it's about. ... I'm excited. I'm ready to go.\"\n\nThe Jets have to make a decision on their starting quarterback by Tuesday, when players return from their four-day Thanksgiving break. Coach Rex Ryan said it's not a tough call at this point.\n\n\"We'll see,\" Ryan said. \"We've got another day of practice. That's what we've got to look at and see how the situation unfolds.\n\n\"If you just look at where he is at this point, he looks good. You look at what Greg did, too. You look at what we did against a good team with a lot of different players.\"\n\nRyan said the decision to start Sanchez or McElroy has \"absolutely nothing to do with any kind of controversy or anything like that. We've got a good quarterback. We know we have two good quarterbacks. You guys want to make this some big controversy, but that's not the case.\"\n\nMcElroy said he is excited for Sanchez and happy for himself, as well.\n\n\"When you have two quarterbacks, you're going to get one of them going,\" he said. \"I'm excited to see Mark back. It's a good thing.\"<|endoftext|>"

His father was a physician, and his mother was the daughter of another doctor. He was educated at Fermoy Grammar School.\n\nHart's father died when he was twelve, leaving the family in financial difficulties. Hart was forced to earn a living and so took a job as a clerk in the Civil Service of the East India Company at a salary of £100 per year. He became fluent in Urdu and Hindi. After six years, he left the service of the East India Company and moved to China.\n\nHe joined the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs in 1851. He worked at Amoy in Xiamen and at Shanghai. He worked at Fuzhou and Hong Kong. He spent some time in Macau before moving to Canton in 1859. In 1863, he was promoted to Inspector General. Hart was promoted again in 1871 to Chief Inspector, and became Inspector General in 1882. In that position, he was responsible for administering and enforcing the Chinese Maritime Customs' rules and regulations and for conducting negotiations with other governments. He negotiated many new treaties with foreign powers. He retired from that position in 1897. He died in London in 1905.\n\nThe famous novel \"Lost Horizon\" by James Hilton has a British consul who is modeled after Hart.\n\nHart was created a Baronet, of Claremont in the County of Cork, on 10 August 1899. He received several honours and decorations from foreign governments, including the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath from the British government, the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold and the Legion of Honour from the Belgian government, and the First Class Order of the Double Dragon from the Chinese government.\n\nOn his death, he was succeeded as baronet by his eldest son Sir Ronald Hugh Stewart Hart, 2nd Baronet.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Chris Van Gorder\n\nChris Van Gorder (born March 16, 1955) is the former head coach for the women's basketball team at the University of Cincinnati.

During his tenure, he compiled a record of 157-108. Van Gorder was the first head coach of the Akron Zips women's basketball team.\n\nIn 2005, he was named Mid-American Conference Coach of the Year after his Zips finished 22-9 and went to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn the 2006-2007 season, the Zips started the season ranked 12th nationally but dropped out of the rankings following a 65-67 home loss to Western Carolina. Despite the loss to Western Carolina, Van Gorder's Zips won the Mid-American Conference regular season title and the Mid-American Conference Tournament. Van Gorder's Zips then lost to Tennessee in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn the 2007-2008 season, Van Gorder's Zips were not ranked to start the season. But after two early victories against ranked opponents, Van Gorder's Zips were ranked 25th in the nation. Van Gorder's Zips remained in the top 25 for a majority of the season and won the Mid-American Conference regular season championship for a second consecutive year. After a first-round loss in the NCAA Tournament, Van Gorder was named Mid-American Conference Coach of the Year for the second time in three seasons.\n\nVan Gorder was let go at the end of the 2012 season and hired by the University of Cincinnati on April 5, 2013.

It was the seventh round of the 2010 Formula One season. The 60-lap race was won by Red Bull driver Mark Webber, after he started from second position. Lewis Hamilton finished second for the McLaren team and Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso came in third.\n\nPirelli's prime tyre compound was the hard \"primes\", whilst the option tyre was the soft \"option\" compound.\n\nMark Webber took pole position for Red Bull, his first since the 2009 Belgian Grand Prix, while Fernando Alonso set the fastest time in Q2 and qualified second. The two Ferraris filled the next row with Felipe Massa ahead of Kimi Räikkönen. The two McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button were fifth and sixth, with Nico Rosberg in seventh place, having struggled all weekend with the handling of his Mercedes. Adrian Sutil in the Force India was eighth, followed by Sebastian Vettel in the second Red Bull and Nico Hülkenberg in the Williams. Paul di Resta, Sébastien Buemi and Michael Schumacher rounded out the top ten. At the start, Mark Webber led away from Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa while the two McLarens of Hamilton and Jenson Button slipped backwards, with Hamilton eventually being forced to pit with an electrical problem, and Button dropping to eleventh. Mark Webber's race soon went wrong as he came into the pit lane to switch to his wet weather tyres on lap 11, but was told to remain in his pit box as he had not switched off his engine, having forgotten to do so. This meant he was stationary for 23 seconds and dropped to fourth, before recovering to third by the time he rejoined the circuit. He also had to serve a drive-through penalty for passing Alonso on the grass, although he eventually finished fourth.\n\nAlonso and Massa pitted on laps 18 and 22 respectively, rejoining in second and third places behind the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton, who had made an early pit stop for dry tyres and was running a different strategy to the two Ferraris. With the track still wet, Hamilton, Massa and Alonso all switched to the intermediate tyres on lap 25, but at this point, the gap between the top three was only 1.3 seconds. The McLarens of Hamilton and Button were then unable to pass the Ferraris on the drying track and they began to slip backwards, eventually losing their fourth and fifth places to the two Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta. The latter had passed Sutil on the main straight on lap 30 after the Force India driver had made a pit stop and had a clear track in front of him, and held on to fifth place despite being passed by Sutil a few laps later. The two Toro Rossos of Jaime Alguersuari and Sébastien Buemi were the first of the lead lap cars to pit on lap 28, with Alguersuari dropping behind Rosberg in the standings after pitting earlier than the Mercedes driver. The other Toro Rosso of Sebastien Buemi managed to stay out longer and maintained his eighth place, before making a pit stop at the end of lap 34.\n\nFurther back, Jenson Button was the first of the two McLarens to pit for new tyres on lap 33, with a nine-second stop due to an electronics problem with the wheel gun which meant the front left tyre was not fitted correctly. Team-mate Lewis Hamilton followed suit a lap later and rejoined the race in twelfth place. Button rejoined the race behind Sébastien Buemi and passed him on lap 36, but was behind Adrian Sutil when he stopped for fresh tyres on lap 38, although Button was able to pass Sutil a few laps later, with Buemi also getting ahead of the Force India. At the end of the 43rd lap, Lewis Hamilton had managed to pass Paul di Resta and move up to eighth place, with Sutil falling to ninth, having been passed by both Buemi and Button. Hamilton's battle with Buemi came to an end on lap 44 as the two McLarens pitted together, with Hamilton getting ahead"

It was first introduced in a paper presented at the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER 2004) by the same name, and published in Cluster Computing in 2006.\n\nThe purpose of cluster switching is to maintain system services even when a node or the entire cluster fails. Cluster switching is often used in parallel or distributed systems where the nodes are not permanently connected to each other. In this case, it is possible to have one node fail without impacting the others. The challenge with cluster switching is that it requires the system to transparently move the workloads to other nodes without affecting their performance.\n\n<|endoftext|>Lozada\n\nLozada is a surname.

It was a single-engined, single-seat monoplane fighter designed to replace the A6M Zero, which was designed for shorter ranges.\n\nThe N1K was developed to replace the Nakajima A6M Zero in the long-range fighter role, and was the first fighter in the world to use the Type 3 \"Hakuryū\" 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, which was also used in the Kawanishi N1K1-J \"Shiden\" fighter. The Japanese Navy also gave it the name \"Kyofu\" (meaning \"Strong Wind\") as the manufacturer's symbol, the first time a name was given to a Japanese military aircraft.\n\nIn the end, only a handful of N1K1 fighters (armed with two 20 mm cannon and two 12.7 mm machine guns) were deployed operationally before the end of the war, and none ever engaged enemy aircraft in combat. After World War II, the Allied Occupation forces in Japan took possession of six N1K1 fighters and four N1K2 fighters. These aircraft were studied and flight tested by the Technical Air Intelligence Unit (TAIU) at Tachikawa. Test flights and subsequent analysis revealed that the N1K2 was the faster of the two types, but its lighter armament was deemed inadequate for combat, and the aircraft was regarded as lacking in manoeuvrability.\n\nFollowing the war, some of the N1K2 aircraft were provided to the USSR, and some were used by the \"Taiwanese Air Force\" (ROCAF), until all remaining aircraft were destroyed by a typhoon in 1950.\n\n\n\nThe only two remaining airworthy N1K2-J Shiden, on display in Japan, are preserved at the following museums:\n\nThe only remaining N1K1-J is on display at the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California.

The N1K1-J was removed from display in late 2013 for a full restoration, including flight testing, and returned to display on March 10, 2017.\n\nThe Soviet Union took possession of several of the N1K2-Ja variants and used them as the prototypes for the development of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15.\n\nTwo Shiden's survive in Taiwan.

Bushmaster was also the head of the ruthless Bushmaster drug cartel.\n\nContents show]\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nNot much is known about John Bushmaster's early life, except that he was once involved in organized crime. He became a drug lord and took over his brother's position as head of Harlem's Paradise. He later became involved in the criminal organization known as the Hand.[1]\n\nLuke Cage's Power\n\n\"Tell me where they took Misty Knight.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with me?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to let you walk away.\"\n\n\"Who's going to stop me?\"\n\n\"Luke Cage.\" ―Luke Cage and Bushmaster [src]\n\nWhen Bushmaster witnessed Luke Cage throw a man out of Harlem's Paradise for harassing some young women, he asked his brother, Quincy, to help him get rid of the unruly patron. The next day, Bushmaster called the man who was threatening to sue Harlem's Paradise and threatened to kill him. When Cage returned, Bushmaster tried to persuade Cage to leave by telling him he did not belong there. Bushmaster revealed to Cage that his name was John Bushmaster and that he was the owner of Harlem's Paradise. When Cage insisted that he would be staying, Bushmaster noted that he did not know who he was messing with before Cage told him he was messing with Luke Cage.\n\nCage remained in Harlem's Paradise and caused problems for Bushmaster, much to his annoyance. Bushmaster and his men began selling the Bushmaster drug throughout Harlem. Cage overheard Bushmaster's name when it was said by his brother Quincy during a phone call. When Cage visited Bushmaster at Harlem's Paradise and accused him of being behind the Bushmaster drug, he denied it and told Cage to leave. Bushmaster's men, however, confronted Cage and attacked him. Cage easily overpowered all of them and escaped from Harlem's Paradise.[1]\n\nChasing Misty Knight\n\n\"I'm getting sick of your bullshit.\"\n\n\"Is that what you tell all the girls?\" ―Bushmaster and Misty Knight [src]\n\nWhen Cage attacked one of Bushmaster's drug warehouses and threatened to kill Bushmaster if he did not tell him where he was keeping Misty Knight, Bushmaster told him that he did not know what he was talking about and Cage attacked him. Bushmaster ordered his men to shoot Cage while he escaped. The bullets did nothing to Cage as they could not penetrate his skin.\n\nBushmaster visited Pop's Barber Shop and threatened to burn down Pop's Barber Shop and kill everyone inside if he did not get a haircut, including the young girl named Tilda Johnson, who could do a mean cornrows, before he left. Tilda snuck out of the shop and stole Bushmaster's car while he was inside getting a shave. Bushmaster ran outside and found Tilda attempting to get away. He then chased after Tilda in the stolen car.\n\nTilda was able to evade Bushmaster's pursuit until he was able to push her car off the road and caused her car to roll over and crash. Bushmaster dragged Tilda from her car and found out who she was. Tilda, however, was rescued by a bystander who had witnessed the entire incident and called the police. Bushmaster was arrested for kidnapping, but he was released from police custody later.[2]\n\nBusiness Proposition\n\n\"Now, we are making money, yes, but not as much as we should. It's a competitive market, man. You're good. And that girl, well, she's something else. I'm offering you a piece of this action. 25% for the both of you.\"\n\n\"That's not how this works.\"\n\n\"You know what? It is how this works. It's time for you to grow up.\" ―Bushmaster and Shades [src]\n\nBack at Harlem's Paradise, Bushmaster offered Shades a percentage of his drug business, but Shades refused. Bushmaster made an offer to Diamondback to sell him some of his product in exchange for a fee. Bushmaster met with Shades, who berated him for not being a better businessman and selling to Diamondback. Shades told Bushmaster that he was selling drugs on his own, but Bushmaster told him that he had a plan to sell his drugs in Bushmaster branded bullets. Bushmaster then attempted to seduce Shades' wife, Tilda Johnson, but she refused his advances.\n\nThe next day, Bushmaster gave a speech to the patrons of Harlem's Paradise as they celebrated the end of their evening. Bushmaster boasted about his power and demanded that they bow to him, but was met with little response. Shades then insulted Bushmaster, who then drew his gun on Shades. Luke Cage then attacked Bushmaster, but Bushmaster managed to get the upper hand and beat Cage into submission. As Bushmaster prepared to shoot Cage, Tilda Johnson shot Bushmaster in the chest with a concealed gun and stole his gun, with Shades shooting the other members of Bushmaster's entourage before they could react.\n\nBushmaster and his men went into hiding at a warehouse, where Bushmaster furiously scolded Shades for his betrayal. Shades explained that he had been working with Diamondback, but now wanted to make a better life for himself and his wife. Bushmaster, realizing that Shades had a point, agreed to go into hiding for the night. The next day, Bushmaster was visited by Knight, Shades, and Cage. Knight had returned to take back Harlem's Paradise. Knight gave Bushmaster a chance to surrender, but Bushmaster refused and attempted to shoot Knight, but was overpowered by Cage and Knight, forcing him to surrender.\n\nWhile Knight and Cage prepared to transport Bushmaster to Ryker's Island, Bushmaster told them that the shipment of drugs would be arriving that night. The police tried to stop the convoy, but the SWAT team was gunned down by Bushmaster's men. Knight decided to attack the warehouse to stop the shipment from getting to New York.

Bushmaster told them that the guns had already been sold to a man named Ricky. Knight and Cage traveled to a diner to look for Ricky, where they found Ricky talking to his partner Rico. Knight threatened Ricky into giving her the location of the shipment. Once Ricky told Knight the location, she and Cage drove to the location where the guns were being shipped. Knight was able to steal the guns from the men who were shipping them, but one of Bushmaster's men threw a grenade into the truck. Cage managed to catch the grenade and toss it back at Bushmaster's men, but was then hit by the truck, knocking him unconscious. Knight ran Cage to the hospital while Bushmaster's men reclaimed their guns and returned them to Bushmaster.[3]\n\nPersonality\n\nTo be added\n\nAbilities\n\nExpert Combatant : Bushmaster was an expert hand-to-hand combatant, as he was able to easily fight off Luke Cage with little effort.\n\n: Bushmaster was an expert hand-to-hand combatant, as he was able to easily fight off Luke Cage with little effort.

"It's been more than a decade since the last major update to Britain's copyright law, and it's high time that the UK brought its copyright law into the 21st century.\n\nYou've probably heard that the Government wants to bring in a new Digital Economy Act, which includes a measure to require all ISP customers to opt out of a default-on filter for adult content. Here's how you can tell them that you're not happy with this proposal, using just your email address.\n\nWho?\n\nIf you're concerned about online porn, you might have already signed a petition on the government's website calling for the default-on filter to be dropped. And in the wake of the controversy around the DEA, you might also have signed a petition demanding that ISPs should automatically block sites known to be involved in the distribution of online child abuse imagery. (Both of those petitions are still open for signatures if you want to join in).\n\nBut now it's time to tell the Government about some of the other things they're doing that are not as sensible, and we'll help you do it.\n\nWhat?\n\nFor a long time now, the UK Government has wanted to bring in a new Digital Economy Act. Last summer, the new law was finally published. The Act is massive, and there's lots to argue with, but it looks like the Government may be preparing to rush it through Parliament without any further debate. That means there's a limited window of opportunity to discuss changes to the draft before it becomes an Act of Parliament, and the Government starts work on enforcing it.\n\nThe draft DEA proposes a number of controversial new laws, including the opt-out default filter that's being discussed so widely. But the Act also proposes lots of other worrying measures, and gives the Government a lot more power to interfere with our online communications. The Act's supporters will tell you that it will help to tackle online infringement, for example. But its many critics argue that it risks stifling innovation in online services, and giving the Government a free hand to censor the internet in other ways.\n\nOn Monday, we told you that you could email your MP to demand a debate on the DEA. Now we've got even more reason to tell the Government that we're not happy with the draft DEA.\n\nThis week, the Pirate Party UK submitted a response to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) on the Digital Economy Act, which responds to the Government's consultation on the proposals. We're not the only ones with concerns about the proposals; the Open Rights Group has submitted its own response (pdf) to the Government's consultation, and Index on Censorship has produced a response (pdf).\n\nHere's why we think the Government's proposals are a Bad Thing:\n\nThe proposals for an \"Extended Liability for Platforms\" could have serious unintended consequences for small internet service providers and independent content sharing websites, making them responsible for policing their services and preventing copyright infringement. We think this is likely to stifle innovation in new services, and also has serious implications for our online privacy.\n\nThe plans for an automatic filtering system to block content that is not classified by the state could lead to a drastic over-blocking of content. It could block more than just \"extreme pornography\" - it could block access to anything the Government decides is inappropriate. There's no requirement for these filters to be accurate or transparent, so we won't even be able to tell what's been blocked.\n\nUnder the proposals, the Government would also have the power to block websites that it claims are \"blatantly\" or \"unlawfully\" infringing copyright. This could be a serious threat to online innovation, and to our online privacy. And again, there's no requirement for these blocks to be accurate or transparent.\n\nThe DEA would make it much easier for the Government to put in place more blocking orders, and extend their scope. The wording of the legislation is vague enough that it could be used to order ISPs to censor content that isn't even illegal. The Government has already said that it wants to use its new powers to stop us from accessing websites that might be used to share copyrighted material.\n\nThe DEA is the biggest threat to our online privacy since the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act. If the Government gets its way, then they'll have the power to block websites and track what we're doing online. And they'll be able to do it without even telling us that it's happening.\n\nYou can read the Pirate Party's full response to the DEA consultation here (pdf).\n\nNow we need your help\n\nIf you're concerned about the DEA, you can join us in telling the Government what you think about the proposed Act.\n\nThe Open Rights Group's response (pdf) to the DEA consultation is still open for signatures. Once they've got enough names on the petition, they'll send their response to the Government.\n\nAnd now we've got our own response to the Government's consultation on the Digital Economy Act. Please support our campaign to stop the Act by signing our response here (pdf).\n\nWe'll be sending our response to the Government later this week, and we hope that it will give people the opportunity to stop the Act before it's too late.\n\nThis is the one chance we have to stop the DEA. But we need your help. Please support our campaign to stop the Act.<|endoftext|>BevMo Beverage Superstore in California is a chain of beverage and snack retail stores.

It’s a policy that seems to favour the government at the expense of foreign interests and brings into question whether or not the government has a commitment to fighting corruption and seeking justice.\n\nThe new policy has been met with much scrutiny both in Zimbabwe and internationally. Many have expressed concern that the implementation of the policy will be flawed and that it will ultimately lead to a worsening of the economic situation in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), has expressed its disapproval of the policy, stating that it will further marginalise Zimbabweans who aren’t involved in the government or who support the opposition.\n\nOn the international level, the Indigenisation policy is one of the latest changes to the Zimbabwean government that have raised concern. Since he took office in November 2017, President Mnangagwa has brought the central bank and the national oil company under government control. This has led to further speculation about the political and economic direction that the government intends to take.\n\nIs the policy legal?\n\nThe Indigenisation policy was initially announced in 2010 and later replaced by another policy called the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim-Asset). The Zim-Asset policy, which was issued in 2013, introduced a set of guidelines for the process of indigenisation. It requires that 51% of all Zimbabwean businesses be transferred to the country’s black majority. However, the policy has never been enforced.\n\nThe decision to revive the policy in 2017 has been widely criticised. Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement urging Mnangagwa to repeal the policy. HRW believes that the policy will only exacerbate the poor economic situation in Zimbabwe. The statement also notes that the government has never properly implemented the policy. It states that “the fact that no businesses have been indigenized in the past six years suggests that it is unworkable, and that it will not contribute to economic development or job creation.”\n\nAs a member of the African Union, Zimbabwe is bound to uphold the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights, which contains specific provisions regarding the protection of private property. These provisions state that the Charter guarantees the rights to private property ownership and the right to participate in the management of natural resources"

Ray, a professor of economics at Calcutta University, died last Thursday in Calcutta Medical College Hospital after a long battle with pneumonia.\n\n''I am running from pillar to post to try and get a post mortem,'' said Mrs. Ray, whose husband is also a professor of economics at Calcutta University. ''My father was very much against autopsy and it was his express wish not to have it performed.'' Ray A.B. Ray, 82, was born on the campus of Presidency College, one of the oldest seats of higher education in India. He came from a wealthy and cultured family and had gone abroad to study economics in London.\n\nOn his return he became a prominent figure in Calcutta's intellectual and literary circles, editing newspapers and translating the ''Futurology'' series of lectures by the great French writer Andre Malraux.\n\nHe was an adviser to Indira Gandhi in the early days of her political career. He served in Parliament as a member of the Congress Party until his retirement from active politics in 1976.\n\nHe was admitted to Calcutta Medical College Hospital on Feb. 4, and received treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit. His condition gradually deteriorated and he died last Thursday.\n\nHis daughter, Dr. Suchitra Ray, said she was not at all satisfied with the treatment her father received in the hospital and thought that medical staff had not done their job properly.\n\nShe said that her father had been suffering from pneumonia for three years and that he had been given an injection a few days before he was admitted to the hospital.\n\n''My father was extremely allergic to penicillin,'' she said. ''Injecting him with penicillin at a time when he was in a very bad condition was in my opinion a highly irresponsible act.''\n\nThe doctor in charge of the intensive care unit, Dr. Abhijit Gupta, said that he could not discuss individual cases but that he had had no complaints about the treatment of Mr. Ray.\n\n''We did all we could,'' he said. ''It was very sad. His condition was very grave. It was a heart attack that killed him.''<|endoftext|>RIGS Creator Platform Playstation 4\n\nPC Genre Shooter, Sports Release Date 29th October 2016 Price $59.99 (PSVR Only) $19.99\n\nRIGS is an action sports game exclusively for PSVR. It was developed by Guerrilla Cambridge (and published by Sony) and released on October 29th, 2016. It takes place in a futuristic sci-fi setting, where you play as one of a number of different characters. Each character uses a different kind of battle suit, allowing them to take part in 3 different sports. Those sports are essentially the 3 main games. They are called RIGS, Megaton, and Gravity Wars. These games play as though they’re real sports. They play more or less how you’d expect them to. You score points by hitting goals, and your objective is to take the ball, and score it in the goal.\n\nThe first game is RIGS, which is essentially a shooting game. There are multiple game modes. Each mode is the same, except you’re playing different characters, and there’s a different goal for you to hit. RIGS is the most fun game in the package, simply because it’s a FPS, which is something you don’t get a lot of in VR games.\n\nMegaton is a sort of bumper-car football game. It’s the second most fun game in the package, just because it’s an interesting spin on something we all know. It is also a lot easier to master than RIGS.\n\nGravity Wars is a very interesting concept, and very hard to master. The game has no physics, and you have to control your direction by using the stick on the right. It’s very challenging, and once you get the hang of it, it can be fun.\n\nRIGS: Mechanized Combat League is a game that is good fun for those who have VR. There’s nothing else like it. It has an interesting concept, and it makes for an interesting single player experience. The multiplayer is there if you want it, but if you don’t, you can use bots, and they will be enough to let you master the game. It does have a lot of potential, and if Guerrilla Cambridge do a sequel, it will most likely be worth it.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat for VR\n\nVariety\n\nWell made\n\nGood concept\n\nCons:<|endoftext|>Phantom ~ Opus 4 ~ Raw\n\n~ Chapter One ~\n\nTitle: Phantom ~ Opus 4 ~ Raw\n\nAuthor: Starfyre\n\nBeta: freddie-m\n\nPairing: Eventual MeixLu\n\nSummary: After 2 years of therapy, Liu is released back into the world and he returns to the only place he calls home.

It's a beautifully written story and I recommend you all check it out. I loved it so much I was inspired to write my own story of 2 boys on a trip to Shanghai. Since I am in no way the author that Inu'sLurker is, I apologize for my lack of originality. But I thought that perhaps if I wrote about something that happened to me I would find it easier to write a story like this.\n\nAnd what happened to me was that one year, the day before my birthday, my mother and I went to China. Now that I look back on it, it was a very exciting trip, though at the time I was rather sad because I was turning twelve. I had been dreading the day, and it was nice to be with my mom because she always made me feel better.\n\nIt was also an interesting trip because we were staying with my Grandfather for a few weeks. He lived in Shanghai, and he was the one that took us to China in the first place. So it was an adventure for me to be in a place that he lived. I only saw my Grandfather on holidays, and it was a great experience.\n\nI hope you all enjoy this story as much as I enjoyed writing it.\n\n- - - - -\n\nIt was just before eleven in the morning when we arrived at my grandfather's house. We had been traveling for quite some time and I was very excited to see him. He came out of the house to greet us"
"Rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft are under increased scrutiny after a self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian last week.\n\nThey’re called autonomous, but are they ready? It turns out not even close.\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that self-driving technology is more or less as old as the automobile itself. In fact, there are a number of cars on the road today with self-driving features, but they are only meant to assist the driver and not take over completely.\n\nOne such system, called Autopilot, was first launched by Tesla in October 2015. The main feature allows the car to drive itself on a highway, but it’s still supposed to be monitored by the driver.\n\nUnfortunately, Tesla and Elon Musk have become a lightning rod for scrutiny after an accident last week that killed a Model X driver using Autopilot. A series of emails have revealed that Tesla has attempted to make it clear that Autopilot is not a “self-driving” feature.\n\nIn a recent letter to shareholders, Musk wrote, “When used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.”\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? For one, this was an admission that the technology was not yet ready for public consumption.\n\nTesla is also being called to answer to whether or not the driver should have known that he was using the Autopilot feature. The company says the driver would have known since he was sitting in the driver’s seat and the car’s steering wheel was not in a locked position.\n\nA photo taken by a witness has been released, showing the driver looking down at something with his hands not on the wheel.\n\nThe automaker has since issued a recall to fix the issue and said it will be updating the Autopilot system to ensure that drivers stay engaged with the vehicle’s operation.\n\nUber said it will be disabling the self-driving feature in its fleet of Volvo XC90s after one of its vehicles ran a red light in San Francisco last week, killing the woman. The car was in self-driving mode and the Uber employee behind the wheel wasn’t able to take control of the vehicle in time.\n\nTesla and Uber are not alone in pursuing self-driving cars. Most automakers have some form of autonomous vehicle in the works, as well as companies like Google and Apple. Tesla is still the only automaker with a Level 5 vehicle that has no steering wheel or pedals, however.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Google’s self-driving cars have only been involved in 11 accidents over the course of 1.5 million miles of driving, but most were caused by human error.\n\nGoogle has said that the biggest hurdle for self-driving cars will be the creation of a trust between car owners and their vehicle. To that end, the company has been testing a number of prototypes over the last several years, which they claim have driven millions of miles without causing any accidents.\n\nVolvo has been developing its own version of an autonomous vehicle for some time now, but the company is not going at it alone. They’ve partnered with Uber, which bought some XC90 vehicles from Volvo, to run a fleet of self-driving Volvos for ride-hailing in Pittsburgh, where Uber’s research center is located.\n\nWith the recent incidents involving Tesla and Uber, the questions of what’s right and what’s safe have only been heightened. Tesla is going to fix the problem with its Autopilot system and Uber is pausing its own self-driving testing, but it’s clear that these vehicles are a long way from being ready for mass adoption.\n\nWill the driverless cars revolution ever happen? The answer seems to be a resounding yes, but it won’t be anytime soon.<|endoftext|>Truly great parties start with quality lighting.

It has however changed the way in which tax relief on contributions to personal pensions is calculated.\n\nThe current situation, whereby the actual value of the tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution, as opposed to the rate of relief, is included in the calculation of income tax, has led to some confusion.\n\nThere is a belief that the relief that is received on the sum of a pension contribution is reduced to 10 per cent and therefore is not as good as the relief received on ISAs, where the actual value of the relief is not included in the calculation of income tax.\n\nThis misunderstanding may well have led to some people contributing to ISAs rather than pensions in order to maximise tax relief.\n\nIn addition, if the actual value of the tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution is used as a deduction from the gross amount of the pension contribution then the level of relief has not changed at all. The actual value of the relief received on the sum of a pension contribution in the income tax calculation has increased in line with the amount of gross income that is subject to tax relief.\n\nFor example, a gross contribution of £10,000 would result in an actual tax relief of £7,500 under the current arrangements (the gross contribution is grossed up by 50 per cent to give the net pension contribution of £7,500).\n\nUnder the new arrangements, the gross contribution would remain at £10,000, but the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution would be £7,000. The relief on the actual value of the pension contribution is not reduced to 10 per cent.\n\nThe amount of gross income that is subject to tax relief is now £40,000. If you earned this amount in income before your pension contributions, then the actual tax relief on the sum of the pension contribution would be £30,000, rather than £7,500.\n\nWhat has changed is the way in which the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution is calculated. The net pension contribution (the amount actually deducted from the gross income) will no longer be grossed up to produce the actual tax relief received on the sum of the pension contribution.\n\nTherefore, the actual tax relief received on the sum of a pension contribution will always be lower than the actual tax relief received on the actual value of a pension contribution.\n\nIt is important to note that it is not the rate of relief that is affected. It is the actual value of the relief that is reduced. The rate of relief is not affected.\n\nPension contributions are still exempt from tax, although the amount of income that is excluded from tax is less than it would have been if the relief was given on the actual value of the pension contribution.\n\nSecondly, the changes to the regulation of pensions and ISAs have not increased the level of tax relief on pensions. The actual level of tax relief on pensions has not changed. The maximum level of tax relief is still 40 per cent.\n\nThe regulation of pensions has changed. Under the new rules, the maximum amount that can be paid into a pension pot, subject to tax relief, is £1.8 million. The maximum amount that can be paid into an ISA, subject to tax relief, is £7,000.\n\nBoth the maximum contribution level of pensions and ISAs has increased, but the maximum tax relief that can be obtained on both types of products is the same.\n\nIf you have already opened a pension plan, then you can only increase the contribution amount by £2,880 per year. Any extra contribution beyond the annual limit will not be eligible for tax relief. The full value of the contribution, regardless of how much it is, will have to be paid from your gross income.\n\nThe actual level of tax relief on ISAs has not changed. The maximum amount of ISA contributions that can be paid into an ISA in any tax year is £7,000. This has not changed. Any amount that is paid into an ISA in excess of this amount will not be eligible for tax relief. The full value of the contribution, regardless of how much it is, will have to be paid from your gross income.\n\nSo in summary, the actual level of tax relief on ISAs has not changed. The maximum amount that can be paid into an ISA, subject to tax relief, is £7,000.\n\nThe actual"
"How has music from Spain been perceived in its country of origin? After World War II, a new generation of composers, nurtured by the European avant-garde, began to write in a new, progressive, experimental vein. The growth of technology, which had already made its mark on the theatre, the visual arts, architecture and the cinema, had also started to make itself felt in the music world.\n\nSpanish composers, like their European colleagues, were attracted to the possibilities offered by the new electronic and experimental instruments, and soon took their place among the most important of the international avant-garde. This programme presents a series of fascinating compositions from this period of dynamic change, providing a fascinating insight into how this new generation of Spanish composers reacted to the environment in which they lived.<|endoftext|>During the first year of life, children change more than they ever have before. At this stage, parents play an important role in influencing their child’s development.\n\nPregnant mothers are able to greatly influence the infant’s life in many ways. During pregnancy, a woman is able to optimize her diet and avoid environmental pollutants. Even while pregnant, it is important for her to stay healthy and happy, as this will in turn make the baby happier. All of this is important in a child’s development.\n\nBelow are five milestones in a baby’s development.\n\nMovement\n\nYour child has been feeling his own kicks and punches for a while now. He may have even kicked his mom and caused her some pain. The child will also be moving his arms and legs in a jerky fashion. As the baby grows, his movements will become more fluid.\n\nChild’s Hand and Finger Development\n\nBabies are able to grab things because their hands are strong. They are also able to curl their fingers into a fist. During this time, the baby may be grasping onto a lot of things that are near.\n\nThe baby may also have strong movements, such as pinching your fingers. Babies begin to explore their world through their hands. They are also able to control their hands and fingers with ease.\n\nSitting\n\nA baby can begin to sit up on his own. This is because he has grown to a point where he is able to do this. The baby may also be able to hold his head up by himself.\n\nBabbling\n\nThe baby may also begin to make sounds that can be referred to as babble. Babies are able to make a lot of sounds and combine them together. This is a part of speech development.\n\nFeeding\n\nYour child may be starting to eat solid food. This may include mashed vegetables, cereal, and baby food. If your baby is too young to eat this type of food, it may not be a good idea to force it. This can cause choking or other complications.\n\nSource: BabyCenter<|endoftext|>This lecture introduces the practice of mining associations, relations, and dependencies from massive data sets.\n\nRelated Information\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThe exercises in the course support the textbook Data Mining and Predictive Analytics in the Biomedical Sciences, by Nicolas Le Novère, Yan Liu, Jeffrey Leek, and Balaraman Ravindran.\n\nFor background, also check out Jeffrey Leek's introductory lecture to this course.\n\nThis course is based on the book Data Mining and Predictive Analytics in the Biomedical Sciences, by Nicolas Le Novère, Yan Liu, Jeffrey Leek, and Balaraman Ravindran.<|endoftext|>New !\n\nTo access the complete course listing, please log in as a member of the Medical Imaging & Radiation Oncology Learning Community.\n\nMembership is free.\n\nCME Credit: 0.5 CME Credit\n\nNumber of credits allocated to this activity.

"For many years, and at many different homes, the grand game of monopoly was a nightly staple of our game playing regimen. Most of the time the game was played with one of my kids as the banker. The game required a bit of accounting to keep track of all the money. More often than not the game was a heated one and everyone, particularly the banker, enjoyed counting out money while money was being piled up all around the board.\n\nMonopoly is an interesting game for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, it requires the basic accounting function of making change. The cashier has to be able to count out the correct change for all the players. This seems like a very simple, but important function. If a cashier can’t count change, you would have to return the money, and you might not get it back.\n\nAlso, with any money that comes into the game there are some decisions that have to be made. For example, with a loan, how much should be charged to each player. More importantly, how much can the players afford to pay back?\n\nIn addition, how much does the bank loan to the players and what are the terms? What does the bank require to be repaid? At what time? What happens if there is not enough money to pay back the bank?\n\nThis seems like an easy concept, but a lot of my kids had a difficult time trying to figure out what they had to do to get out of debt.\n\nFinally, there are times when players simply get too deep into debt. They are forced to sell off a building, or even the entire game.\n\nThis seems like a pretty simple concept, but I found it interesting because it taught some of my kids a very valuable lesson about life. They realized how important it is to have a budget. More importantly, they realized how much money they had to spend. They had to spend wisely because they couldn’t go into debt.\n\nI think it’s easy to teach kids to balance their checkbook and keep track of their spending, but it’s much more difficult to teach them to spend wisely and stay out of debt.\n\nThe same goes for a family’s bank account. Families, just like the player’s in monopoly, need to keep track of the money coming into the bank account and what is going out. They need to make sure there is enough money to cover the things they need to pay for and that there is enough money to cover the things they want to spend money on. They need to be responsible with their money and realize they can’t go into debt.\n\nThe game of Monopoly teaches a lot of these principles. It is not a game of instant gratification. There are no easy money schemes. It’s a game that will test the mind and the ability to be responsible with money.\n\nIf you have kids, Monopoly is a great way to learn about personal finance. You don’t need to be an expert, but you do need to be willing to show them how to count and account for money.<|endoftext|>The Bengals fell just short of a win in Kansas City Sunday, falling to the Chiefs 31-13. The loss drops the Bengals to 7-9, a number that still includes a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.\n\nOne of the biggest stories to come out of this loss is the fact that star running back Jeremy Hill was benched in favor of Rex Burkhead. Hill didn't have a good game, and the Chiefs were able to put him in his place. Burkhead was also pretty good, and scored the only Bengals touchdown on the day.\n\nBoth running backs ran for over 100 yards, but the key difference was Hill fumbled twice, including once inside the Chiefs' 20. Hill had carried the ball 39 times before the benching, while Burkhead had just nine.\n\nIt was announced Monday that Hill is still the Bengals' starting running back going forward.\n\n#Bengals Jeremy Hill named starting running back in 2018, Mixon to see more action. https://t.co/jZ9624gBwO pic.twitter.com/jOKGewN4zq — Kevin Clark (@bykevinclark) January 1, 2018\n\nThis is an interesting decision, considering the way the Bengals used the two running backs in Kansas City. Hill has been a solid running back throughout his career, but has shown lapses in concentration, as well as fumbling issues. He's not been consistent, and that has made the Bengals hesitant to hand him the starting job.\n\nThe Bengals will likely be looking to get more out of their running backs next season. We saw how talented Joe Mixon is this year, and he's the one who should have the starting job next season.\n\nHill will still be involved in the offense, but this change is a sign that he won't be a starter for the Bengals next season.<|endoftext|>This is the brand new video for “Save Our Souls” from the German melodic rockers CASANOVA.

"Will the traditional establishment defend democracy?\n\nBy Alexandra Morton\n\nUBC-O Sea Around Us Project\n\nI am scared to my bones. For the first time in my life I am terrified that what I learned as a child is wrong. There is no more mother or father to turn to. There is no more food to count on. This is my last chance to sound the alarm that we are being systematically robbed and cheated and lied to and I don’t know what we are going to do about it.\n\nA few years ago I could not have imagined that I would find myself writing this. I was born and raised in the village of Old Massett on Haida Gwaii, also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, in Canada. We fish and hunt and gather food and make our own shelter and build our own community. This is how it has been for thousands of years. In modern language this is called subsistence living. We were the last people in Canada to sign treaties with our colonial oppressors in the 1800s. These documents were the foundation of our way of life.\n\nThen it all changed in the early 2000s when the first commercial aquaculture license was issued on our coasts. At first, like most people on Haida Gwaii, I thought that farming fish would provide income for our community. Little did I know that the promise of wealth would come with a heavy price.\n\nThe first evidence I saw that something was wrong was in 2006. The sea lice were everywhere and a fish farm had started using a pesticide called Slice. I saw the sea lice on the fish and sea lions. I saw sea lions coughing up blood, the bones on their backs visible through their skin.\n\nIn 2007, the open net pen at salmon farm salmon feedlots one kilometre off the coast of my village collapsed. An estimated two to three million Atlantic salmon, with a value of $6.5 million to $8 million, swam into the ocean. There was no monitoring, no analysis of the risk to wild salmon, not a word to local communities.\n\nAnd then the toxins appeared. In 2008 and 2009 people in my village became sick and died. In the village of Klemtu next door, children were born with flipper-like hands and feet. In Norway, which had a higher concentration of fish farms, brain tumours and other cancers were rising and women were giving birth to deformed babies.\n\nI looked at these stories and thought, “This can’t happen to us.”\n\nThis was followed by the closure of the Haida Nation’s only grocery store. People in my village and community started suffering from serious health problems, especially neurological ones. We were told it was due to influenza or SARS. We had no idea that a toxin, which our bodies have not evolved to handle, was being released into the air and our water. The Sea Around Us reported that fish farms were creating the most toxic area in the world, right next to the First Nations in Haida Gwaii. This happened, and no one told us.\n\nI realized I had to do something. For the first time in my life I realized that what my ancestors had always taught me was wrong. It was not nature that took care of us. It was we who were responsible for taking care of nature.\n\nI wrote my first letter to the local newspaper. It was my story, and I was afraid to publish it.\n\n“How many people have to get sick and die before they take this seriously?” I asked.\n\nWe waited and waited, and nothing happened. I wrote my second letter. Nothing.\n\nWe waited and waited. Still nothing.\n\nPeople in my village got sick and died, and the Norwegian scientists kept warning that their food supply was being contaminated. We were told that this was the price of progress, that it was our job to clean up the mess. And we had to do it on our own.\n\nAnd then the baby seals came. There are no young sea lions, so the seals started eating the herring. At first we thought it was cute. Then we realized they were killing the herring. There were too many seals.\n\nI wrote my third letter. I looked at the numbers and saw that Norway was killing 80,000 seals a year and there were only 80,000 seals left.\n\nI started to organize rallies and a campaign called Save the Herring, which caught the attention of major news outlets across the globe. By this time I had a voice. I was a professor of biology at UBC and one of the world’s experts on fish farming, open net pen fish farms, and marine pollution. I knew the science.\n\n“How many baby seals have to get cancer before they take this seriously?” I asked.\n\nIn the midst of this, Canada approved a massive new open net pen farm. This was the largest salmon farm in the world. Our local paper warned us that “the massive farm will increase marine pollution in the area.” This farm started dumping blood and feces into our waters. The evidence was mounting that we were at risk of a catastrophic collapse in our food web.\n\nBut no one cared. The aquaculture industry is worth $400 million a year. We can’t compete with that.\n\nA new form of ocean zoning called an impact assessment was supposed to keep salmon farms out of sensitive areas, but it was all a lie. The people who wrote it are in the industry. They gave themselves exemptions.\n\nThen I realized that I could make a living as a scientist. So I created a lab at the University of Victoria to study the toxins from fish farms. We started to find the pollutants in the mussels and the herring. I published more and more scientific papers.\n\nWe held more rallies, and I wrote more and more letters to the local paper. We were ignored and dismissed.\n\nSo we went to the Supreme Court. Our case was thrown out, but the judge was extremely critical of the Canadian government and gave them 18 months to fix their laws. But the government is now granting the aquaculture industry a blanket exemption from environmental laws and protections. The judge told them that they could not do this. But they did.\n\nI have studied toxicology for 30 years and I have never seen this. We know that these toxins are not getting into our environment accidentally. The only reason they are there is because someone put them there. It is like they are trying to poison us.\n\nAnd then we started to see a new toxin. This time it was a by-product of the feed used in the salmon pens.\n\nA Norwegian scientist tested a by-product of salmon feed. The test showed that it was toxic. The Norwegian government stopped using the feed. In 2015, that same scientist tested all the salmon feed used in the British Columbia industry. The results showed that there was another new toxin, this time a carcinogen. The Norwegian scientist said, “It is extremely unlikely that it could happen at such high levels by chance.”\n\n“How many toxins have to get into our food before we take this seriously?” I asked.\n\nThis time I knew that there was something wrong with my brain. We found out that Norway and Scotland were using the same feed. We had a toxic lab here in British Columbia, so what about Norway and Scotland? And the feed is approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and used in these salmon farms.\n\nIt’s hard to see who we are going to turn to.\n\nThen a woman in Ketch Harbour started asking questions. She wrote to the local paper and was ridiculed and insulted. She wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. He never replied.\n\nShe was not from my village. She was a white woman from Newfoundland. Her grandfather was a fisherman.\n\nI wrote to her, and then I realized I could write to everyone. And I did. I started to get hundreds of people to write letters, and we wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and to our Premier, the head of our government. We wrote to every MLA, the Members of the Legislative Assembly, and we were ignored and dismissed.\n\nSo we went to court again. This time we were supported by 30 affidavits from fishermen and local citizens.\n\nI went to the hearings. The minister did not even show up. His lawyer said that we should stop questioning him and just accept that he is doing the right thing. He had no explanation as to why the 30 affidavits were not enough evidence to put a stop to this industrial salmon farming.\n\n“If I had a million dollars, I could save Haida Gwaii,” I said.\n\nBut I have never been able to raise that money. The man who tried to stop me is now running for Premier, and he is the frontrunner.\n\nSo I wrote my fifth letter to the editor. I warned that if we continued to use this feed, we would all get sick and die.\n\nAnd then I realized that I could put this on Facebook.\n\nA few months ago, the BC government ordered the feed company to remove this toxin from their products. But they still sell it in other provinces. There is still no ban on the feed, even though Norway has banned it, the FDA has banned it, and Health Canada has banned it.\n\nAnd then I realized I could just get on a bus and go to Toronto and speak to people directly.\n\nSo that is what I am doing. I am going to make this my life’s work. I am going to stand in front of people, in universities, in public hearings, and tell them my story. I am going to explain that it is not"

He is also well known for his attempts to fuse the sciences with theology, something of a controversial topic for medieval theologians. The ontological argument itself is based upon the idea that God’s nature is that of existence. Therefore, to say that God exists is to say that God has the greatest nature, which in turn leads to the conclusion that God must exist. Some scholars argue that this is the proof’s most fundamental flaw, namely that God’s nature is unprovable and thus, cannot be equated to the definition of existence. Other critics point out that the greatest nature is really a metaphysic and therefore cannot be understood by people. The latter claim has been supported by Immanuel Kant and many other philosophers since. Kant’s work was not known to Anselm’s, but it is clear that the German philosopher would not have found much use in Anselm’s philosophy.\n\nThe foundation of Anselm’s ontological argument is a branch of philosophy known as natural theology. Natural theology is the search for a knowledge of God through the use of reason. The argument’s goal is to prove that God exists in some way, and as such is a concept that is widely accepted in the world of Christian philosophy. In many ways, Anselm’s argument for God’s existence shares many similarities with the arguments of many of his contemporaries. Anselm claims that God exists and that this conclusion can be proven using the method of defining terms. The proof proceeds from the claim that God is the greatest thing conceivable to the claim that God must also exist. Anselm’s argument does not satisfy many people because it does not provide any evidence to support the claim that God is in fact the greatest conceivable thing. This is one of the major weaknesses of Anselm’s argument, but it is also one of the weaknesses of most arguments for the existence of God. The ontological argument can be seen as an attempt to prove God’s existence without supporting any specific philosophical view of God’s nature.\n\nMuch of Anselm’s work focuses on the attempts to explain and prove God’s existence. He was one of the earliest of many philosophers to attempt to explain and prove God’s existence. The debate over the existence of God has continued over the years, and the arguments have been supported and refuted on many different occasions. Anselm’s work is important because he was one of the first philosophers to put forth the idea that existence itself was proof of God. He was also one of the first Christian philosophers to try and explain the idea of God in a non-theological way. Many of Anselm’s contemporaries had rejected his view on God’s nature, and they also criticized his work on natural theology.\n\nOne of the major debates over Anselm’s work was that of the ontological argument. This is a popular concept that states that God’s existence is a self-evident truth. The name of the argument comes from the phrase “something that is greater than which cannot be conceived”. This concept became widely accepted in the world of Christian philosophy, and it is still being debated today. The concept of God’s existence as a self-evident truth has been supported by many Christian philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas’ view of God was one of the most influential views of God’s nature in the Middle Ages. The ideas presented by Anselm and Aquinas on God’s nature were among the first attempts to view God in a logical way.\n\nMost of Anselm’s work focused on the idea of God and the way in which God was perceived. He focused on the idea that God was perceived through faith and that this idea had a real and substantial foundation. Many critics viewed Anselm as a philosophical follower of Augustine, and he was certainly influenced by many of Augustine’s works. The Confessions of Augustine were written in the fifth century, and they discussed the views of the time on God and the manner in which people should understand God. Anselm’s view of God is therefore quite different from many of his contemporaries, and he was heavily criticized for his work on natural theology.\n\nThe ideas presented by Anselm were extremely influential to his contemporaries. Although his ideas were at times criticized, many of his contemporaries found them to be the most logical views of God. His argument for God’s existence was extremely popular among his peers, but it is one of his most controversial works.\n\nAnselm of Canterbury Biography\n\nAnselm of Canterbury was born in 1033 in Aosta. He was the second of four sons and his parents were wealthy. Anselm’s father was an Italian who owned a noble estate. His mother was the niece of the archbishop of Rheims. Anselm was well educated, and he studied both rhetoric and literature as a young man. He studied law in 1057 at the cathedral school in Laon. During this time, he became close friends with Roscelin of Compiègne. Roscelin was an expert on logic, and he would be one of Anselm’s best friends and mentors for the rest of his life. He was also close to Lanfranc and eventually became his student.\n\nAnselm studied theology in the early 1060s at the cathedral school of Chartres. He also spent a great deal of time studying theology and grammar at the school of Benevento. Anselm spent two years at the school and was then called to the cathedral school of Canterbury in 1062. Anselm was called to the cathedral school to replace the archbishop. The archbishop of Canterbury was the highest ranking prelate in England and he was charged with the administration of the Church in England. Anselm quickly gained respect in his new position, and he wrote a new rule for the cathedral school. The rule was based on the Rule of St. Benedict, which was the most important rule for monasteries at the time. He was also responsible for the cathedral school’s many other duties and its administration. He established the system of electing canons and was also in charge of its finances. Anselm had a great deal of power in his new position, but he also was a reformer. He placed emphasis on the importance of education and scholarship, and he ensured that the students received high quality instruction. The rule at the cathedral school was seen as being high quality and the students at the school were trained in Greek, Latin, rhetoric, dialectic, and arithmetic.\n\nAnselm also established a library at the school. The library contained many ancient works, which were frequently read by students. He became an expert on the writings of Augustine, and he began his own writing career in the early 1060s. His writings were influential in the development of later philosophy, and his ideas on natural theology were both influential and controversial. In 1063, Anselm was appointed archbishop of Canterbury. This was an extremely important position, and Anselm would play a major role in the Christianization of England. He was a major contributor to the revival of learning in England, and he attempted to bring education to all of his subjects.\n\nHe was a skilled theologian, and he produced several important theological works. These included the Monologion and the Proslogion. The Monologion addressed the questions of the nature of God. The Proslogion addressed the questions of the nature of God’s knowledge and the proof for God’s existence. Anselm was influenced by Augustine in his writing of the Monologion"

It happens all the time, although it's usually because a sheriff's department employee who should have registered the convicted sex offender doesn't think the guy will do it again.\n\nSometimes a new chief or sheriff takes over the department, doesn't like the policy, and cancels the sex offender registry.\n\nHere's another scenario: When the convicted sex offender is released from prison, he is given a deadline by the parole board to register.\n\nIf the parole board gives the guy a year, the sheriff's department is probably going to give him a year.\n\nHowever, if the parole board gives the guy a year and the county sheriff wants him off the street, he will register the convicted sex offender that day.\n\nIn the case of Felix-Jimenez, the sex offender registry is mandatory and the deadline wasn't up yet, so how he is able to be on the loose is still unclear.\n\nThe good news is that Felix-Jimenez hasn't gone into hiding.\n\nIn fact, the most recent report shows that he is staying in a homeless shelter in Van Nuys.\n\nCalifornia doesn't want him there.<|endoftext|>Granted, my current policy does not meet what I want to do, so I have done some thinking on what changes would be nice. There are two major changes I think should be made.\n\nThe first would be to include the deletion policy as the first part of the “FAQ” section, as opposed to the second, where it is now. The issue here is that it is currently hidden away, and unless you know to go there, you might not even know it exists. This is why I believe the policy should be in the FAQ, in addition to the other policy changes.\n\nThe second major change would be to change the time periods for deleting and undeletion requests. Currently, these time periods are a month for both and can be extended for a total of 2 months. These time periods need to be shortened. If a user creates an account, and decides it is not for them within a week, they should be able to delete it without the issue being made public, since no other users have commented on it. If a user creates an account and decides that it is not for them within the first month, they should also be able to delete it without it being made public. Also, it is not fair to users who are newer, and decide that they do not wish to use the site for the first time period to only have it deleted. These users should be able to delete them after this time period if they choose. I believe these time periods should be a month for deletion requests, and 2 weeks for undeletion requests.<|endoftext|>Perhaps best known for their exploits during the First World War and the Gallipoli campaign in particular, the ANZACs, or Anzacs, are the legendary members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.\n\nTheir contribution to the military campaign in the Middle East, including the battle at Gallipoli in 1915, will be recognised this year, with the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign being commemorated by the nations involved.\n\nThe events of the Gallipoli campaign resulted in heavy casualties, with a staggering 258,000 deaths and an additional 156,000 injuries for the Allied forces, including 44,000 British deaths and 29,000 French deaths.\n\nThe staggering casualty figures have subsequently been seized upon by those who question the strategic worth of the campaign.\n\nOne figure, British historian Niall Ferguson, wrote that “the Dardanelles fiasco was one of the greatest military blunders of all time, a story of incompetence, vanity and wishful thinking out of which could have been constructed a textbook case of how not to run a war”.\n\nSo why were the Gallipoli campaign and the actions of the ANZACs so significant for Australia and New Zealand, and what did the battle mean for the two countries?\n\nArrival of the ANZACs\n\nFollowing the outbreak of war in 1914, the Australian and New Zealand forces began arriving in Egypt. On February 25 1915 the first ANZAC troops arrived at Gallipoli, a total of 11,000. The rest of the 20,000 strong force arrived over the following weeks.\n\nMany of the ANZAC troops had volunteered at the outbreak of war, lured by the romantic and patriotic view of warfare and by a yearning for adventure.\n\nJust as the troops were largely made up of volunteers, the casualties at Gallipoli were also predominantly made up of volunteers.\n\nIt has been estimated that 10 percent of all the Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli were killed during the campaign.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies commented that “the experience of war for Australians would always be Gallipoli”.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the ANZAC troops, the British had launched an attack on the Gallipoli peninsula on the 25th of April 1915.\n\nThe Allied attack consisted of five divisions, with most of the troops coming from the British Army. It was hoped that the landings would help the British Navy to get through the Dardanelles, a narrow strip of water separating the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara, which leads to the Bosphorus and the Black Sea.\n\nHowever, the initial landings met with great opposition from the Turkish defenders, and the Allied forces soon became pinned down on the beaches and unable to advance.\n\nThe ANZAC troops arrived at Gallipoli, the capital of the Ottoman Empire’s European territories, just over a month later on the 19th of May 1915.\n\nThe ANZACs had initially been part of the British and French force in Egypt. They were moved to a separate command under General Ian Hamilton, with Australian General William Birdwood as his deputy.\n\nA General Order issued on the 3rd of May stated that the Australian and New Zealand troops were to be given “separate and distinct” duties from those of the British.\n\nThis was not intended to be interpreted as any form of segregation. Rather, it was due to the fact that the Australians and New Zealanders, despite being part of the British Empire, were soldiers who had volunteered from their own country, and who had formed a unique sense of national identity and pride.\n\nIn order to maintain a clear distinction between the Allied forces and the enemy, the ANZACs also adopted their own distinctive insignia, such as a yellow or red poppy on their badges and hats.\n\nHowever, despite the greater efforts to set the ANZACs apart from their Allied allies, the treatment of the soldiers at Gallipoli was the same as that received by the British.\n\nThe ANZACs were given responsibility for the defence of the Anzac Cove, at the northernmost tip of the Gallipoli Peninsula.\n\nThe cove was strategically important to the Turks because of its proximity to the Narrows, the strip of water which separated the peninsula from the Dardanelles.\n\nThe Anzacs were also expected to hold on to the various hills and ridges along the peninsula, despite the fact that the Allied positions were in constant danger of being shelled"

The Ekobrew takes a lot of the guesswork out of the whole process. Fill the hopper with whole coffee beans, twist the top to open, drop the portafilter in, turn the handle a few times and you’re ready to make your espresso.\n\nThe container is made of a non-porous material, so you can put ground coffee in it. It also has a couple of holes on the side, so that you can clean it and store it without having to remove the portafilter. The concept is pretty ingenious, but I had some difficulty in actually getting it to work properly.\n\nIn theory, the machine takes a lot of the stress out of making espresso. When it works, the espresso is good. It has a big enough capacity that I could probably make it twice before having to refill it. It would be nice if there was a better way to tell how full it was.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s a fairly unreliable method of extracting espresso. You can only have it set to brew for a specific amount of time. You can’t use any sort of fancy steaming wand to make sure the pressure is exactly right, or adjust the grind to get a specific flavour. I think this device is designed for making a quick shot in the morning and then tossing the puck after the shot is made.\n\nThis is the kind of device that I can imagine being useful to take on a trip, or maybe for an RV or camper, but not in a regular espresso bar or cafe. At the price of $50, I can’t really recommend it, though I do think that it has potential. If it were a bit more inexpensive, I think it would be worth experimenting with.<|endoftext|>I like it!\n\nI like it!\n\n$750 DSQUARED2 Short dress is on sale! $375\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\n$170 CRISTINAEFFE Short dress is on sale! $72\n\nI like it!\n\n$290 CHRISTIES À PORTER Short dress is on sale! $206\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\n$340 ERMANNO DI ERMANNO SCERVINO Short dress is on sale! $254\n\nI like it!\n\n$440 Jil Sander Short dress is on sale! $323\n\nI like it!\n\n$138 TROU AUX BICHES Short dress is on sale! $85\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\n$460 Alberta Ferretti Short dress is on sale! $322\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\n$219 CRISTINAEFFE Short dress is on sale! $117\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\nI like it!\n\n$104 JUST FOR YOU Short dress is on sale! $70\n\nI like it!<|endoftext|>Horses, rabbits and fish swimming around in glass globes are an enticing attraction at Hanging Lake Lodge in Fruita. But, for more than a century, the people have had a passion for Hanging Lake.\n\nChildren, horses, deer and pet dogs are all welcome to stay at Hanging Lake.\n\nDogs are welcome at Hanging Lake Lodge, as long as they don't swim.\n\n\"There were (people) that were always trying to get to the lake,\" said Dale Hanks, whose great grandfather built the original Hanging Lake Hotel.\n\nHanks has been running Hanging Lake Lodge since 1972, and says his customers are almost always from out of town.\n\n\"They've been told about it by their neighbor, they've been told about it by their son who visited last year, they've been told about it by friends in Colorado, and when they're here they just have to come,\" Hanks said.\n\nMany visitors are drawn to Hanging Lake by the nearby Red Canyon, as well as the Colorado National Monument. The lake is located in a canyon along the Colorado River, nestled at the base of a rock formation called the Palisades. The National Monument, also known as The Dots, is a rock formation of mostly red and orange that spans for about a mile along the Colorado River.\n\nThe Dots.\n\nHanging Lake is a water body that was formed by lava over millions of years, according to the National Park Service. The water body is fed by a small underground river and water seeps out through the canyon walls to form the lake.\n\nHanging Lake is known as one of the most picturesque lakes in the country, and often the photos seen online or on Instagram have a filter on them. The color of the water is bright blue, the rocks are a fiery red and orange, and the waterfalls are turquoise blue.\n\nA tourist sits by the Hanging Lake waterfall.\n\n\"It's an excellent opportunity to do some waterfall photography,\" said Ben Lin, a Denver resident. \"That is what drew me here, the waterfall, and I don't know why, but it is very hard to take a bad picture here.\"\n\nLin has been to Hanging Lake several times, the first time in 2015. He came with a small group of about 10 people, and the people in his group were in awe at the sight.\n\nThe fall\n\n\"This is the best,\" Lin remembers one person saying. \"This is the best picture, we are so lucky.\"\n\nThe water temperature in the summer is about 45 degrees, and not many people are willing to dive into the water, which Lin says is a shame.\n\n\"I feel like you should be able to swim here, it's a beautiful place to swim,\" Lin said. \"The problem is the lake is only as deep as your chin. When you're done swimming there is all that debris and gunk on the lake, you can't see it from up above, but as you're swimming you feel the gunk and rocks in the bottom of the lake.\"\n\nAlthough swimming is prohibited, people do still swim in the lake, which causes the algae to increase, according to the National Park Service.\n\nHanging Lake is one of the first stops for many travelers, but after leaving the picturesque sight, many people don't realize there is so much more to Fruita than Hanging Lake.\n\nNext time you are passing through the small town of Fruita, consider stopping at Hanging Lake Lodge for lunch, a short hike, or an afternoon in a hammock. The history behind the town and the visitors will not disappoint.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to correct information about Hanging Lake.

"During my first month of graduate school, I received a call from my aunt on a weekend when I was in the middle of working on my thesis. She needed help moving out of a rental property she owned. I went over that weekend and helped her clear out the house.\n\nAfter it was all done, she said to me, “You know, a lot of people would be really upset at me for making them do this.”\n\nI smiled.\n\n“That’s why I am here.”\n\nIt’s funny how a simple answer can change the dynamics of a relationship.\n\nI continued to help my aunt after that weekend. She would ask for my help, and I would drop what I was doing. She asked, I gave. I took it for granted that it was my responsibility to help her out, to be available. I also took it for granted that she was comfortable asking me for help.\n\nA few years ago, I went to see my aunt in the hospital. She was having a difficult time recovering from her medical procedure, and I was her first call. I didn’t think twice about dropping everything and going over to her place to take care of her and her dog, especially since she had just moved to an apartment that didn’t allow dogs.\n\nBut I got to the hospital and found out that my uncle was also at the hospital. I didn’t realize that he was in the hospital, and, by the time I found out, he was asleep in a nearby room. I talked to my aunt and we came to the realization that it was important for her to have my uncle there. She needed him in a way that she didn’t need me. I left.\n\nI don’t think my aunt and uncle even realized how much I had changed. I was not as available to help as I used to be, and I knew my time was better spent on other things. I was a graduate student, after all, and I had a whole other life to live.\n\nAs a result of all of this, my aunt and uncle started to depend on others to help out more. They hired a house cleaner and a housekeeper. They began to call people in order to receive the help they needed. I had thought that they would not want to go through the hassle of finding someone to help, but they did.\n\nIt’s as if they needed to be reminded that it was okay to ask for help. They needed to realize that asking for help wasn’t a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. That asking for help meant you were confident in who you were and what you had to offer, and that you weren’t afraid to ask for help if you needed it.\n\nIn doing so, my aunt and uncle showed me what it meant to ask for help, and I realized that asking for help could be a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>Une analyse de la CNIL\n\nBac d’information, traitement automatisé, robots, IA… nous avons tendance à penser que les systèmes automatisés ne sont pas faits pour répondre à nos besoins de compréhension, de sensibilité et d’empathie.

The Object class is an abstract class and doesn't have a constructor. If you don't have any idea what I'm talking about here, don't worry about it for now. I'll explain it in detail in Chapter 5. You can't instantiate an object from the Object class, so the only real purpose of the Object class is to serve as a base class for other classes. You can think of the Object class as being like a template that all other classes derive from. If you want to learn more about how classes work and how you can customize Excel's classes to create your own customized classes, check out my Microsoft Press book Microsoft Excel VBA and Macros (ISBN 0-7356-1845-0).\n\nWhen you create a class module in your Excel application, you must specify the class name as a string literal. For example, if you create a class module called Class1, Excel uses the following syntax in the declarations area of the class module to specify the name of the class:\n\nPublic Class Class1 End Class\n\nAs with any other module in Excel, a class module doesn't do anything until you create an object from the class module. Creating an object is a two-step process: You first instantiate the object, and then you call the methods and properties of the object. For example, to create an object from the class named Class1, you use the following code:\n\nDim obj1 As New Class1\n\nOnce you create an instance of the object, you can call the methods and properties of the object by preceding the method or property name with the name of the object. For example, if you created an instance of the class named Class1, you would use the following code to call the method named Display:\n\nobj1.Display\n\nIf the object contains an object variable that represents another object of the same class, you can also call the methods of that object. For example, if the object named obj1 created in the preceding code contained an object variable named obj2 that represented another object of the same class, you would use the following code to call the Display method of the object named obj2:\n\nobj1.obj2.Display\n\nThe property and method names of a class are preceded by the name of the class, as shown in the preceding examples.\n\nIf you create a class module that contains a custom collection object, such as a collection of cells in a worksheet, you must use a new operator to create the collection object. For example, the following statement creates a collection object named myCol1 that is a collection of worksheet cells:\n\nDim myCol1 As New Collection\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you specify the type of object that the collection can contain when you define the type of the collection.\n\nFor example, the following statement creates a collection object that can contain only the cells in a worksheet:\n\nDim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range)\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you can add items to the collection object by using the Add method of the collection object.\n\nFor example, the following statement adds a range named \"Region\" to the collection object named myCol1:\n\nmyCol1.Add mySheet.Range(\"Region\")\n\nThe Add method takes two arguments:\n\n■ The object that you want to add to the collection object\n\n■ The collection that you want to add the object to\n\nWhen you create a collection object, you can add an object to a collection object that is an instance of a different class, but the type of the objects in the collection must be the same.\n\nThe following code example adds the range named \"Region\" to the collection object named myCol1. This code example assumes that you've created the objects in the declaration section of the class module.\n\nSub AddObjectToCollection() Dim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range) Dim myRow As Long, myColumn As Long Dim strName As String ' Obtain a reference to the collection ' that contains the first worksheet in ' the active workbook. Set myCol1 = Sheets(1).Range(1, 1). _ SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible) ' Initialize the name of the cell ' to the value of the Name property. strName = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Value ' Determine the address of the cell ' and store it in the myRow and myColumn ' variables. myRow = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Address myColumn = myCol1.Cell(1, 2).Address ' Create a new Range object. Set myRange = Worksheets(\"Sheet1\"). _ Range(\"Region\") ' Add the new range to the collection. myCol1.Add myRange End Sub\n\nThe following code example calls the AddObjectToCollection method to add the range named \"Region\" to the collection object named myCol1. This code example assumes that you've created the objects in the declaration section of the class module.\n\nSub AddObjectToCollectionWithMethodCall() Dim myCol1 As New Collection(Worksheet.Range) Dim myRow As Long, myColumn As Long Dim strName As String ' Obtain a reference to the collection ' that contains the first worksheet in ' the active workbook. Set myCol1 = Sheets(1).Range(1, 1). _ SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible) ' Initialize the name of the cell ' to the value of the Name property. strName = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Value ' Determine the address of the cell ' and store it in the myRow and myColumn ' variables. myRow = myCol1.Cell(1, 1).Address myColumn = myCol1.Cell(1, 2).Address ' Create a new Range object.

Energy production has increased over the same period, but the country’s domestic energy supply has not kept pace. The growth of energy demand outpacing domestic production resulted in a significant reduction in oil and natural gas stocks. The country became increasingly dependent on imported energy.\n\n\n\nDomestic energy production is also likely to experience a plateau"
"Many people who oppose the minimum wage assume that raising the minimum wage is bad for the economy and will cause a lot of unemployment. This is mostly false. A new study has revealed that raising the minimum wage does not kill jobs. This is not just good news for the people who will now get a raise, but also for the economy as a whole.\n\nOpponents of the minimum wage often say that it will create a lot of unemployment and that this is proof that the minimum wage should be abolished. They argue that it creates a job loss on an economy-wide scale. However, this new study has proved that the minimum wage will not cause massive job loss. This is not just great news for the people who get a raise, but it also means that the economy will benefit.\n\nThe study comes from the National Employment Law Project (NELP) and reveals that raising the minimum wage does not cause massive job loss. In fact, only two percent of the workforce is impacted by a minimum wage increase. This means that the economy will benefit, but not that much. However, it is still a positive impact.\n\nHowever, the study also shows that the country would have to raise the minimum wage by $2.13 to achieve the same number of jobs as a similar increase in the 1990s. This is not really a surprise, as the economy was growing more rapidly back then.\n\nRaising the minimum wage was also seen to boost the economy. The study found that a $1 increase in the minimum wage would increase the GDP by $2.62. This is a significant amount and would be great for the economy as a whole. In fact, it could even boost the economy so much that it could lift more people out of poverty.\n\nWhile a raise in the minimum wage does not have a massive impact on the economy as a whole, it still has a positive impact. This means that the people who will now get a raise will enjoy it. This will also help the economy, and make the country a better place to live in.\n\nThose who oppose the minimum wage should know that it does not create massive unemployment. This is also great news for the economy, and it means that raising the minimum wage is great for everyone.<|endoftext|>“\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending you to the body of workers in Australia, either in Railway or Country Tramways, or Electrical construction.

"Borodino (village), Moscow Oblast\n\nBorodino () is a village (\"selo\") in Odintsovsky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Tvertsa River.\n\nThe village of Borodino was first mentioned in 1611 as part of the Tsaritsyn \"oprichnina\".\n\nIn 1812, the Battle of Borodino, a major battle of the French invasion of Russia took place near Borodino. The village is now a site of the museum and the memorial. The French lost the battle, but went on to win the war in 1814.\n\nIn 1898, Borodino was the place where Nikolai Basargin and Nikolai Morozov organized a commune and founded a school of commune life that lasted from 1898 to 1902.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century Borodino was also the place where Andrey Voznesensky had a summer dacha.\n\nThere is a railway station in Borodino.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Michal Hašek\n\nMichal Hašek (born April 8, 1980) is a Czech professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently playing with HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga. He previously played in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Colorado Avalanche, Ottawa Senators, and Florida Panthers.\n\nHašek spent the 1996–97 season with HC Pardubice's junior team, and then joined the Czech Extraliga club HC Vsetín, appearing in 29 games. Hašek was a member of the Czech Republic national under-18 team at the 1997 European Junior Championships, playing in two games and posting a 1.51 GAA.\n\nThe next season, Hašek joined HC Pardubice, which was then playing in the Czech 1. Liga. Hašek played well for the team, and was chosen by the Colorado Avalanche in the sixth round, 162nd overall, in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He remained with HC Pardubice, and in his final season with the club, he posted a 2.30 GAA in 37 games. Hašek was signed by the Avalanche, and on March 9, 2000, he made his NHL debut, against the Detroit Red Wings. He played two more games for the Avalanche before returning to the Czech Republic to join HC Pardubice for the 2000–01 season.\n\nHašek played in 11 games for the Avalanche the next season, but spent the majority of the 2001–02 season with the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, where he posted a 2.20 GAA in 44 games. He remained in North America the next season, playing five games for Colorado and 59 for Hershey, and was then traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for a sixth-round pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft on March 10, 2003. Hašek played well for the Blackhawks in 2003–04, with a 2.11 GAA in 37 games.\n\nThe next season, Hašek played well for the Blackhawks, with a 2.22 GAA in 36 games. However, he was unable to maintain his form, and was replaced as Chicago's starting goaltender by Nikolai Khabibulin, who had been acquired by the Blackhawks in a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Hašek was then traded to the Ottawa Senators on March 9, 2005, for a second-round draft pick in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nIn his first season with the Senators, Hašek played in 40 games, and posted a 2.26 GAA. He then missed the majority of the 2005–06 season after suffering a shoulder injury. He appeared in just five games for the Senators, and was traded to the Colorado Avalanche for Patrick Eaves, a second-round draft pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, and a third-round pick in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft on September 25, 2005.\n\nHašek quickly returned to form with the Avalanche, playing in 54 games and posting a 2.22 GAA. In 2006–07, he played in 57 games, and posted a 2.30 GAA. Hašek was an important factor in the Avalanche's playoff run, as he posted a 1.65 GAA in eight games.\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Hašek signed a two-year contract extension with the Avalanche. The following season, he played in just 35 games due to a groin injury, and his GAA rose to 2.88. He was then sidelined for the rest of the season after having shoulder surgery.\n\nOn June 30, 2009, Hašek signed a two-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings. He recorded the first win of his Red Wings career on January 2, 2010, in a 3–1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nOn January 1, 2011, Hašek was named the First Star of the Week for the week ending December 26. Hašek compiled a 3–0–0 record, a 0.67 goals-against average and a .984 save percentage. He led the Red Wings to their fifth four-game winning streak of the season. During the streak, Hašek stopped 135 of 138 shots and yielded only one goal in a span of 140 minutes and four seconds.\n\nOn January 20, 2011, Hašek was selected as the NHL's Third Star of the Week. He went 2–0–1 in three appearances, with both victories coming against Central Division rivals (January 14, 3–0 win at Chicago and January 16, 4–1 win at St. Louis), and recorded a 1.00 goals-against average and a .962 save percentage.\n\nHašek finished the 2010–11 season with a career-high 41 victories, just one win behind league leader Martin Brodeur.\n\nOn March 29, 2011, Hašek scored a goal against the Los Angeles Kings. The goal, a result of a breakaway due to an errant pass by Kings defenseman Slava Voynov, was the second of Hašek's career. His first goal was scored against the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2008. The goal also made him the oldest goaltender in NHL history to score a goal in a game. The record was previously held by Tommy Salo, who scored a goal in a game at the age of 35.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, Hašek underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder.\n\nHašek was injured during the 2011–12 preseason, and on October 2, 2011, was placed on long-term injured reserve by the Red Wings. He returned from his injury to back up Ty Conklin for a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on November 29, 2011.\n\nOn July 5, 2012, Hašek signed a one-year, $2.05 million contract with the Florida Panthers. He was named the starting goaltender in the Panthers' inaugural game in the 2012–13 season against the New Jersey Devils. He was subsequently pulled in the first period after allowing 4 goals on 15 shots. He was replaced by Scott Clemmensen, and on January 24, 2013, Clemmensen was named as the Panthers' starting goaltender for the remainder of the season.\n\nHašek was placed on waivers by the Panthers on June 13, 2013. Hašek was then bought out from the final year of his contract on June 15, 2013. He was then signed by the Detroit Red Wings for the 2013–14 season to backup starter Jimmy Howard.\n\nHašek became an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, and on September 11, 2014, signed his first contract abroad, agreeing to a one-year deal with HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga. After one season in Pardubice, Hašek opted to continue in the Extraliga, signing a two-year deal with HC Vítkovice. In his second season with Vítkovice, Hašek helped his club claim its first league title since 1999, appearing in 15 playoff games. He left as a free agent to sign a one-year contract with HC Pardubice on June 19, 2017.\n\nHašek played for the Czech Republic at the 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 World Championships, winning bronze in 2004 and 2005. Hašek was the starting goaltender for the Czech Republic team that won the gold medal at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.\n\nIn 2003, Hašek became a Canadian citizen, but had already represented the Czech Republic in international competition, and he was therefore eligible to play for either national team. On November 7, 2005, he announced that he would continue to represent the Czech Republic, even though he had been approached by the Canadian team and was eligible to play for Canada. Hašek's younger brother Ondřej also plays professional hockey.\n<|endoftext|>Helium leak\n\nA helium leak is a leak of helium from its container.\n\nHelium is a diatomic gas and therefore more difficult to confine than many other gases. The inert gas may diffuse through even very small leaks into other parts of a vacuum system, or it may leak into the atmosphere. Diffusion is facilitated by higher pressure on one side of a barrier. One way of countering this effect is to use helium's very low solubility in common materials. Helium also may leak into vacuum systems from poorly-made, improperly-applied, or damaged seals. \n\nHelium leak detectors use a small electric current through a coil inside the container to detect leaks. They are often found in high-vacuum and ultra-high-vacuum systems.\n\nAt room temperature, helium leaks through most materials at a rate of about one molecule every 10 seconds. If a"

That is exactly the case with Andreas Antonopoulos. He has reportedly been bombarded with requests from individuals who want to make donations to his projects. But he has no means of receiving them.\n\nIs Andreas Antonopoulos Being Misled?\n\nMost people know Andreas Antonopoulos by now. He is one of the most popular and prolific figures in the Bitcoin world. However, the widespread adoption of Bitcoin has led to a lot of new users, many of whom do not have a great understanding of the technology. That is not necessarily a bad thing, though.\n\nIt now appears as if a lot of people think Andreas Antonopoulos accepts donations, whereas he doesn’t. As such, people keep bombarding the Bitcoin community icon with messages asking how they can make a donation. This leads to quite a few jokes being made about it on social media. However, Andreas Antonopoulos is well aware of the situation, as he keeps getting the same questions.\n\nHowever, the most intriguing part of this situation is how Andreas Antonopoulos makes it clear he doesn’t accept donations. For some reason, some people continue to pester him about it. Some individuals even claim they are only able to donate a small amount of money, which would make no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe Andreas Antonopoulos Donation Account\n\nInterestingly enough, Andreas Antonopoulos is quite open about Bitcoin donations, but only to the extent of signing them over to projects. That is not what most people would expect, but it makes a lot of sense to give this money to a good cause. For example, Antonopoulos has donated over US$5,000 worth of Bitcoin to help rebuild the war-torn Marawi in the Philippines. It is evident this money came from donations he received, which is a very interesting development.\n\nThat being said, donations can still be made to Andreas Antonopoulos, even though it is done in a different way. Instead of sending money to his personal wallet, a public Bitcoin wallet has been created for donations to be sent to. That wallet has been active for some time now, and users can send money to a wide range of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash wallets.\n\nDo you think donations should be sent to Andreas Antonopoulos? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nread original article here<|endoftext|>Rottnest Island\n\nThe second island in the chain, after its neighbours Fremantle and Rottnest, is Barrack Street. In 1831, a convict ship called the “Duke of Wellington” (there are other tales about the origins of the name) ran aground here and was eventually abandoned. The women were moved to Fremantle Prison. The wreck is still there, but it is being eaten by the sea. You can walk to it on a path from Waterhouse Beach. The best way to see the island is by bike, though, because it is so small and flat. The bikes are provided by a company called Island Experience Rottnest. This is a great way to see the island. It costs around $25, which gets you a bike and the unlimited use of it for three hours. They give you a map and instructions, but you can see the whole island by walking in about an hour.\n\nThere are very few buildings here, but what there are have a very interesting history. For example, there is the Weeroona Hotel, the oldest operating hotel in the state. It is run by a company that is owned by the island’s inhabitants. The oldest building is called the Round House. It was built in 1833 and has been restored to the 1830s period. It used to be the men’s quarters. There is also a small cathedral that was built in 1901, and is called St Mary’s Cathedral. There is also a cricket ground here that was originally established in the 1840s. This island was once the penal colony. The ruins of two of the prisons, the Governor’s residence and the convicts’ huts can be seen. They are located at a place called Settlement.\n\nCamel Rock\n\nThis is the most important landmark of the island. It is visible for many miles, and is sometimes mistaken for a camel. The sandstone is interesting, as it was formed from quartzite, which is a very hard stone. Some of the grains have been turned to iron oxide, which is a reddish brown. This was done by chemical reactions that were the result of oxygen and iron.\n\nSome rock formations can also be seen at the Quobba station, which is a restored 19th century railway station. There are a few lookouts here, but the best is at Arch Rock, which is a short distance from the main road. There are about 200 species of birds here, and there is a sanctuary that is managed by a conservation group called the Rottnest Island Conservation Society. This is home to the Tawny Frogmouth, the Black-breasted Button-quail, the Malleefowl, and the Rottnest Island White-tailed Black-Cockatoo.\n\nThere is also an Interpretive Centre that explains the history of the island and its different birds. Another reason to visit this island is the fact that the Aboriginal people, the Wadjuk, were here first. There is an Aboriginal reserve that is in the northern area of the island, and there is also a sacred site that can be seen there. The site is called Yanjul, which means “man with spear”. The local Aboriginals still refer to the island as Wadjemup, which means “Island of Peace”. The First Fleet stopped at this island, and as such it is the only island in the world where two different nations fought for control.\n\nPlaces to Stay\n\nThere are a few different places to stay on this island. Most of the accommodations are self catering. There are also a few bed and breakfasts, and there is even a four star hotel called the Sheraton Rottnest Island Resort. There are over 250 different cottages to stay at, some of which have been converted from old army barracks. The Great Western Hotel is the only hotel here that has electricity and telephone connections, so you may want to stay there if you want to be near the center of things. There are many hotels here, but most of them are more expensive than the average.<|endoftext|>This great vinyl adhesive cloth tape is waterproof, flexible and conformable to curves.

Yesterday, I got a letter from Robert D'Orta, the writer who's suing Paramount for copyright infringement over the Star Trek reboot. He wants to settle. And I've got to say, my heart just jumped. A settlement means that Paramount's going to have to pay some kind of damages, and I get to share in it. Maybe I get a check, maybe I get some percentage of whatever they owe to Robert. I can't believe it. That one line. \"Paramount's counsel has been in contact with me about settlement.\"It just keeps me going.

It was one of the books that inspired me to get into fantasy fiction. The author, J.R.R. Tolkien, was a legend in the world of fantasy fiction, and it was considered one of his greatest works.\n\nAt the time, I hadn't heard of this series. If I had, I probably would have thought \"Ew, it's another fantasy book.\" It would take me several years to learn that it's not another fantasy book. This is the one that started it all.\n\nThe story was great, and I really liked how Tolkien put all his imagination into it, and wrote a story that was unique and innovative. The story itself was fascinating. I loved the idea of Hobbits, which are little people that lived in an idyllic area, with their own language and customs. This book had a dark side, and even the humor in it was dark. There was a lot of death, evil, and destruction in the book. That's something that stuck with me, even though I really didn't appreciate it at the time. I was in my tween years, and just didn't understand it."

The body piece is way too long for a normal sized girl, there’s so much extra material, you can barely make it look like the girl in the picture. It doesn’t look as cute as the other girls ones, and the extra length isn’t easy to shorten, because of the netting on the bottom.\n\nFun! Love this costume! My daughter is small and the medium was perfect! Can’t wait to see her in it at school on Halloween!\n\nBeautiful! This costume is beautiful! It fits true to size and looks great!\n\nGorgeous costume I love this costume and it fits true to size. I have a slender 7 year old, ordered the size 6-8, and it fits well with some room to grow into. The only drawback I see is the flippers are sewn into the gloves so she won’t be able to wear them separately, but that’s a small sacrifice for the beauty of this costume!\n\nCutest! Love it! My 5 yr old loves her new swimmer costume. It's made well, super cute and just the right amount of \"bling\"!\n\nSO STINKING CUTE! This costume is exactly what I was looking for!

Since the release of the current champion rotation, only five champions have been released. Each of these champions (except for Xerath) was tested in the PBE at some point, so we knew what to expect when the champion was released.\n\nXerath was the next to last champion to be released. He came out in the middle of the season and, because of his kit, has been popular for quite a while. He didn't really have that many people against him, and it didn't take him long to climb into the current meta. He was picked a total of 11 times in the North American Championship Series and showed a 65 percent win rate.\n\nZed, like Xerath, was released at the beginning of the season, but there are still people who have not really mastered him yet. His popularity in the NA LCS was fairly low and his win rate was only 58 percent. Zed's popularity has since risen to the top and he is now played regularly in the NA LCS.\n\nBrand is another interesting case. His play rate has risen from 0 percent in the NA LCS to 3 percent. His win rate is not that great (44 percent), but because he is a burst caster, he fits in with the current meta. As long as you have the ability to lock down one person for a period of time, Brand is pretty strong.\n\nFinally, Vi was the last champion to be released, but her popularity is still a bit low. She has been played nine times in the NA LCS, with a 43 percent win rate.\n\nWith those three champions, Riot has shown that it will not just dump out new champions on the game, and that champions will still have to be tested on the PBE before being released.<|endoftext|>Photo by Gracie Malley for Cannabis Now\n\nAs California rolls out its new cannabis rules — the most relaxed marijuana laws in the country — state and local law enforcement officials are attempting to implement the new system with an unprecedented blitz of raids on illegal pot businesses.\n\nWith the stroke of Gov. Jerry Brown’s pen, California became the largest state to legalize marijuana for recreational use and the sixth in the nation to make cannabis available to the general public. Yet, the history of cannabis in California has been a long one — and not without its rocky moments.\n\nCalifornia’s medical marijuana laws were first approved by voters in 1996 and ushered in a sea change in cannabis culture and use. Yet even in the heyday of Proposition 215, there were raids on medical dispensaries, law enforcement shutting down shops for violation of local zoning codes and municipal zoning laws, local municipalities levying taxes on dispensaries and even offering up community space in which to open shops.\n\nThe result of these early legislative setbacks? The displacement of a long-established network of dispensaries and cultivators. Those who could no longer get by in the state moved to Oregon, Washington, Colorado and other legal states — essentially exporting the cannabis culture they had created. Now, a new generation of cultivators and distributors are starting businesses in California, with new methods and processes that are a result of the new cannabis industry.\n\nEven as recreational marijuana use became legal in California in January 2018, there has been an uptick in raids of these newly legal businesses, which remains illegal under federal law. In the first week of 2018, there were a reported 26 raids of legal dispensaries in the Bay Area, with 25 arrests and the seizure of $16,000 in cash and seven pounds of cannabis.\n\n“Law enforcement is going to go after illegal operations in any case,” said Sean Donahoe, executive director of the California Cannabis Industry Association. “These folks who are doing illegal activities, that’s something they have been doing all along.”\n\nIn California, the rules on commercial cannabis businesses are numerous and complex, he said. The fact that a business may be operating legally, that doesn’t mean it isn’t being targeted for a raid, according to Donahoe. In order for businesses to get permits to operate legally, they have to first get permits to be established.\n\n“Some of the communities, their local government entities have decided"
"Hillary Clinton was a no-show at the opening of a new museum dedicated to women's history and equality in New York City on Tuesday, a day after she cancelled campaign events because of a stomach virus that left her dehydrated and dizzy.\n\nClinton's Republican opponent Donald Trump and his wife Melania did not attend the high-profile opening either.\n\nClinton's doctor said in a statement Monday that the Democratic presidential candidate had been \"diagnosed with pneumonia\" on Friday.\n\nThe museum is dedicated to women's history and feminist causes. Clinton's ties with the National Museum of Women in the Arts go back many years.\n\nShe presented the museum's founding patron, Mercedes T. Bass, with a leadership award in 2009. The museum's chair, Susan Henshaw Jones, has been a top Clinton donor.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton said on Monday that the former secretary of state \"continues to feel better,\" but he didn't indicate when she would resume campaigning.\n\nCampaign spokesman Nick Merrill said the Democratic presidential nominee has had an allergy-related cough, and that \"several hours of sleep\" and some antihistamines helped.\n\nThe illness struck just after Clinton flew back to New York City from a weekend trip to California.\n\nOn Monday, her doctor Lisa R. Bardack said in a statement that Clinton had had an examination of her pneumonia in a chest CT scan.\n\nBardack said the Democratic nominee \"is recovering nicely\" and has been \"advised to rest and modify her schedule\" as she continues to recuperate.\n\nClinton abruptly left a 9/11 anniversary ceremony Sunday in New York City after feeling overheated, according to her campaign. She retreated to her daughter's nearby apartment, but later emerged and told reporters: \"I'm feeling great. It's a beautiful day in New York.\"\n\nShe left Sunday's event at Ground Zero shortly after she arrived. Her campaign said she felt \"overheated\" and departed for her daughter's apartment in New York's Flatiron neighborhood.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander showed Clinton apparently struggle to get into a vehicle as staff members held her up by the arms.\n\nClinton, 68, did not immediately disclose the pneumonia diagnosis. Her aides initially said she had overheated.\n\nBardack said Clinton is \"re-hydrated and recovering nicely\" after attending a 9/11 anniversary event Sunday.\n\nThe health issue was not mentioned at a fundraising event Monday in Manhattan for Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland of Ohio, according to participants.\n\nAsked if the candidate's health was a campaign issue, spokesman Jesse Ferguson said, \"No.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan Lemire in New York and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.<|endoftext|>The former CEO of St. Louis-based Boeing said he will plead guilty to charges that he approved the improper use of millions of dollars in company funds on home furnishings, a casino and a separate investor-relations matter.\n\nThomas W. Jones, 67, was charged with approving improper expenditures at the request of his predecessor as CEO, Philip M. Condit, 63.\n\nBoeing Co. fired both men after the company's internal investigation uncovered what prosecutors called \"improper and illegal conduct.\"\n\nProsecutors said that, in addition to Condit, four other Boeing executives and a Chicago interior designer would plead guilty to various charges related to the kickback scheme.\n\nJones and Condit each face up to 10 years in prison and fines of $250,000 on the conspiracy charge. The other defendants face up to five years in prison and $250,000 fines.\n\n'Systemic fraud'\n\nU.S. Attorney James A. Graves Jr. described the alleged conspiracy as \"systemic fraud.\"\n\n\"This was a company that had an ethical culture, and we find it deeply disturbing that a company like that could have employees commit such fraudulent acts,\" he said.\n\nCondit, Boeing's former chief operating officer, said in a statement that he agreed to plead guilty \"to the company's disappointment, but to help resolve the situation and put this issue behind us.\"\n\nA number of the alleged kickbacks involved funds that were earmarked for aircraft engine development, according to the criminal information filed in the case.\n\nBoeing is based in Chicago, but the scheme occurred in St. Louis, which was home to its defense and space unit until 2003, when the company moved it to Washington state.\n\nBoeing spokeswoman Bonnie Rodney said Friday that the company has cooperated with authorities and overhauled its expense approval procedures. She said the company is not aware of any illegal expenses related to the company's government contracts.\n\n'Widespread misconduct'\n\nIn a filing Friday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis, prosecutors said that \"certain Boeing employees, including several executives, had conspired to engage in the improper and illegal approval of corporate expenditures.\"\n\nThe filings said that Boeing officials believed there was \"widespread misconduct\" that included theft of company funds and illegal personal use of company funds.\n\nIn a \"factual resume\" filed in court, the government alleged that the executives conspired to authorize company expenses for a variety of items, including theater and concert tickets and interior furnishings for Condit's home, without any business justification.\n\nThe money was funneled through a design company in St. Louis. Prosecutors alleged that about $2.5 million was spent on the house, including $130,000 for a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, and $18,000 for a home theater with stadium seating.<|endoftext|>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a group for anyone interested in all things data science.\n\n\n\nWe host a variety of talks and events, including:\n\n\n\n•Talks: Short tech talks, panels and panel debates, and longer presentations on a wide range of topics\n\n\n\n•Workshops: Data science and coding workshops on Python, R, data exploration and analysis, visualization, and other topics.\n\n\n\n•Meetups: Events around the world with data science-focused talks, panels, and panel debates\n\n\n\n•Hackathons: Hackathons where attendees work on data science projects using Python or R.\n\n\n\n•Data science team building: Escape the room and board games to improve teamwork, communication, and data science skills\n\n\n\nThis group is a project of the Data Science DC meetup (http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-DC/).<|endoftext|>The mooring cable holding the stricken Rena, which has been stranded on the Astrolabe Reef off the north east coast of New Zealand's North Island since October 5th 2011, is fraying at an \"unacceptably rapid rate\" and the ship could break up in as little as a week.\n\n\n\nIt could even go as early as Tuesday night, according to New Zealand authorities.\n\n\n\nThey had been expecting the ship to sink, as currents beneath the sea would pull the vessel into the reef, and it would begin to break apart as the tides took it apart. However the \"churning\" around the ship has actually been slowing the process of the ship disintegrating.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the crews on board are clearing the decks of the ship, as the removal of the fuel is to begin today, a job which should take a week or two. The removal of the fuel would then free up the mooring cables and allow the ship to break apart and eventually sink.\n\n\n\nHowever if the cable did break, the pieces of the ship could drift away, or worse, float across the Hauraki Gulf and into the Bay of Plenty.\n\n\n\nThe most recent attempt to free the ship from the reef failed, with the bow slipping from the rocky coral. No one has been aboard the ship since a New Zealand Navy ship fired shots at it in January, when the Rena's crew threw their passports over the side.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese-flagged vessel broke free from its tugs in the Bay of Plenty and hit the Astrolabe Reef, spilling 1,700 tons of fuel into the sea. The damage to the reef has been assessed as being very severe.<|endoftext|>To help raise awareness of depression and suicide, a group of engineering students from the University of Waterloo have designed a robot that can create artwork with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMental illness is a huge problem that often gets ignored, or underplayed. Although the majority of the time you can tell if a person is suffering, there are some cases where it can be harder to identify, especially if you're just talking to them on the phone.\n\nThe team of eight, led by Chris Cui, spent four months designing their robot, which is called DepressionBot.\n\nDepressionBot is now available to help raise awareness of depression and suicide 1:03\n\n\"The robot is meant to help raise awareness for depression and suicide,\" said Cui, a third-year industrial design student, in an interview with CBC's The Morning Edition host Craig Norris.\n\nIt's no secret that mental health issues affect a lot of people, but it's not often that we see people, especially students, take time out of their day to help those affected.\n\n\"It's a really personal subject to a lot of people, but there's a lot of stigma around it, so a lot of people don't want to talk about it,\" said Cui.\n\nSketchbook artwork from DepressionBot.

"To be blunt, the video you linked to does not really prove anything one way or the other. That video is trying to make it seem like some statements made by Dan Abnett about the use of the term \"boy\" or \"son\" when applied to the Raven Guard during the Horus Heresy was a form of apologism for using \"boyz\" when referring to Orks. This is not the case. While it is true that Abnett's statements were inappropriate, the content of that video fails to really show it. For example, where the video claims that Abnett said \"Raven Guard don't ever call themselves boys\", Abnett was in fact saying that Raven Guard did not ever call themselves \"boyz\" or any other similar slang. He specifically mentioned \"boyz\" in the context of Orks as an example, and it is the video that is now misrepresenting his words. In other words, Abnett's statements on the subject of Orks are accurate, and the video's attempt to show him in a negative light is based on a misrepresentation.\n\nAdditionally, your claim that the Imperium is \"far from perfect\" is not true, as the Imperium's culture is based around the worship of the Emperor, who has deified himself and is often referred to as a god by Imperial citizens. This means that the Imperium has absolutely no separation between religion and government, which means that your claim that the Imperium is \"far from perfect\" is also a form of apologism, as it is ignoring a key element of the Imperium that should be readily apparent to any Imperial citizen. The use of \"Apologetic\" is a misuse of the word and also misrepresents what the author is trying to say, as you have misrepresented the claim he is making.\n\nThe author's second \"claim\" is incorrect on many levels, and is also based on a misrepresentation of facts. Firstly, let's take a look at the quote he links to:\n\n\"If we wanted to do a straight-up Space Marines game, we would have done Space Marines, right? They’re the coolest guys.\"\n\nThis quote is taken out of context. The quote actually goes on to explain why they chose to do the Space Marines as they did. In fact, the quote was in response to a question about why they decided to make Space Marines so \"stereotypically heroic\" in terms of a tone. The statement that follows in the quote states that it is because Space Marines are the \"coolest guys\" in the galaxy. What the author is doing here is taking a single quote and presenting it as if it is the entirety of the explanation of why Space Marines are the way they are in this game, when that is not the case.\n\nThe author's next claim is that he does not agree with the statement about the inclusion of certain races, but instead of explaining why he disagrees, he simply says that it is \"wrong\". This does not actually prove that the statement is incorrect, and is a form of dog-whistle politics, as it is deliberately vague and meant to be interpreted as \"political correctness\" or \"SJW\" or \"Cultural Marxism\" and similar things, all of which are highly charged words. He could very easily have explained why he disagrees with the statement, but he did not. Instead, he chose to attempt to shut down any further discussion of the topic with a rather obscure quote, while also using a misrepresentation of the quote to try and do so.\n\nThe author's final claim is based on another misrepresentation of the source material. In his article, the author linked to an article that states that the developers actually took fan-feedback into account when designing the Space Marine Chapters. In fact, the developers mentioned that they were \"watching\" the fans' reactions to the game, and were taking note of how the game was received and what fans' concerns were, which is in line with what the developers have said about their reasons for making the Space Marine Chapters they did.\n\nOnce again, the author is trying to use his article as a form of dog-whistle politics, as he is taking these claims and trying to make it seem as if the developers were lying. However, even if the developers were lying about this, which they are not, that does not invalidate the author's argument. In other words, the author's claims that the developers are lying about this are irrelevant to the argument the author is making, and should not be considered when assessing the validity of his arguments.\n\nIn the author's first sentence, he claims that it is \"common knowledge\" that the Imperium of Man is based on Nazi Germany. However, I do not believe that this is actually true, as I have never heard this before, and the idea seems rather outlandish. In fact, the idea that the Imperium of Man is based on Nazi Germany is so outlandish that it makes me question the author's sanity. Furthermore, his claim is an appeal to emotion, as the author does not really explain why he thinks this, and instead simply uses an emotionally charged accusation.\n\nIn the author's second sentence, he claims that the Space Marine Chapters, as well as the Emperor, are based on \"fascist leadership\". I have already addressed the author's claim about the Space Marine Chapters, and I will now address his claim about the Emperor. While I cannot speak for the Emperor's actual policies, he is still worshiped as a god by most of the citizens of the Imperium, which does not actually fit with the definition of \"fascist leadership\". Furthermore, the author does not really explain how he came to the conclusion that the Emperor is based on fascist leadership, and instead simply asserts it without any real explanation.\n\nThe author's third claim is based on a misrepresentation of facts, and is yet another form of dog-whistle politics. His claim that a representation of the logo of the White Legion is on the flag of the Imperium is a misrepresentation of the source material. In the source material, it is explicitly stated that the White Legion and the Imperial flag are two separate things, with the author's claim making it seem as if the White Legion is the official flag of the Imperium of Man. This is, of course, untrue. In fact, the White Legion is not even in the same star system as the Imperium, so the White Legion's flag is actually irrelevant to the argument that the author is making.\n\nThe author's fourth claim is also based on a misrepresentation of facts, as well as yet another form of dog-whistle politics. The author claims that the developers stated that the Imperium is \"an alliance between Humans and aliens\". While I cannot speak for what the developers actually stated, I can point out that they did not state that the Imperium was an alliance between Humans and aliens. The author's statement that this claim is \"common knowledge\" is false. In fact, if this was common knowledge, then the author would not have needed to claim that this was what the developers had said. Instead, he would have just cited the developers as having said it. In other words, his claim that this is \"common knowledge\" is also a form of dog-whistle politics, as it is a claim that is designed to be interpreted as \"political correctness\" or \"SJW\" or \"Cultural Marxism\" and similar things, all of which are highly charged words.\n\nIn the author's final claim, he says that the Orks are portrayed as a generic enemy of the Imperium, when in fact they are a threat to the Imperium. The author claims that \"Boyz\" is used as an insult by the Imperium, when in fact it is used to refer to any Ork. In other words, his claim that the Imperium is \"far from perfect\" is incorrect, and in fact is a form of dog-whistle politics.<|endoftext|>The general consensus in psychology is that intelligence is a singular entity that can be measured and is unchangeable, and that any issues with intelligence will remain constant throughout a person’s life.\n\n\n\nIn general, the accepted view of intelligence is based on a series of experiments carried out in the 1940s and 50s, commonly referred to as the IQ tests. These intelligence tests measured intelligence by identifying patterns and memory, and tested mental agility. But the modern view of intelligence is much broader, and focuses on a person’s ability to learn and their capacity to understand their environment.\n\n\n\nResearch carried out by a group of psychologists in New York have challenged the accepted view, and shown that people’s IQ levels do not necessarily remain the same throughout their lives.\n\n\n\nThey found that if a person has an early traumatic experience, then the level of intelligence is likely to reduce significantly.\n\nThe study\n\nThe study used a database of IQ scores for each person, which was then divided into three groups: people who were not exposed to early trauma, people who had experienced trauma before they were 18 and people who had experienced trauma before they were 16.\n\n\n\nThe study then looked at how the group with early trauma had scored after 16 years. What they found was that people who experienced trauma before the age of 16 scored lower on intelligence tests at the age of 30. Those who experienced trauma before they were 18 scored even lower than those who were traumatized before they were 16.\n\n\n\nThey also found that the difference between the group who experienced trauma and those who did not was three to five points, which is a significant amount.\n\n\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of understanding trauma and how it can affect people throughout their lives. It also shows that traumatic events can influence how a person learns and that this will have a lasting impact on their lives.\n\n\n\nThe other important thing to note from this study is that the effect of trauma was found to last for 20 years. Even though trauma had occurred so early in a person’s"

He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. The striving to free oneself from this delusion is the one issue of true religion. Not to nourish the delusion but to try to overcome it is the way to reach the attainable measure of peace of mind.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1938)\n\nWho would have thought that the the famous scientist, whose ideas took a leap of imagination that seemed to defy common sense, had so much wisdom to share.\n\nEinstein's wisdom, delivered in a simple, direct manner, is of a philosophical nature. And yet, as we have seen, his wisdom is based on a scientific perspective, not a philosophical one. It is a perspective that, as we shall see, stands in contrast to the beliefs of the average person.\n\nThe ultimate source of Einstein's wisdom is his sense of awe. He speaks of being in awe of what he observed in nature, as if these observations of nature had moved him to the core of his being. But this awe was not the end of the matter for Einstein. He does not speak of being in awe and then simply stop and say: \"What a wondrous world it is.\" Rather, he looks to this sense of awe as a source of inspiration to do more.\n\nEinstein's wisdom is the result of a personal approach to understanding and the sense of awe that this approach has produced. It is, therefore, both a personal and a shared source of wisdom. The person sharing this wisdom is not speaking on behalf of some outside authority, like a philosopher or a scientist. His wisdom is simply the result of a personal quest, not a more generalized, impersonal, public investigation.\n\nEinstein did not discover his wisdom by himself. He spoke about his awe at the \"dignity\" of nature, by which he meant that the world of nature is majestic, not cheap. Einstein was aware of the sense of awe that his discoveries had evoked in him and he wished to share this feeling with others. In this way, Einstein's wisdom was, at its roots, a shared resource, because the more people who can feel and express awe at the majesty of nature, the better it is for all of us.\n\nIt is as though Einstein had an innate wisdom that he wished to share with others, and as though he felt compelled to do so. Einstein's quest for wisdom was not an abstract exercise in which he wished to understand nature or the meaning of life. Rather, Einstein was driven by a need to share his insights. As the physicist Stephen Hawking has pointed out, the very nature of the scientific enterprise is a social activity, and this is as true of Einstein as it is of Hawking himself.\n\nLike Hawking, Einstein had the good fortune of being born into a social context that could support his quest for wisdom. He lived in an environment in which he was exposed to an intellectual culture that had been nourished by many philosophers who were also his contemporaries. He could, therefore, both draw from the wisdom of his predecessors and challenge them by articulating the insights that he had achieved.\n\nIn addition, the new physics that he helped to develop has spawned many technologies that have radically transformed our understanding of the world and has introduced new scientific disciplines, such as quantum physics, that have enriched our understanding of nature. Our scientific knowledge has become a shared resource that can be used as a basis for developing a new kind of wisdom, one that does not exist in the history of human thought before the twentieth century.\n\nAs we can see, the search for wisdom and the sharing of wisdom are based on a wide array of factors. To create a context that will allow for the growth of a new kind of wisdom, one that can benefit the common good of humanity, it is necessary to invest in science and in a new philosophical perspective.\n\nIn other words, a new kind of wisdom can only arise as the result of a new synthesis, one that links scientific knowledge with a philosophical perspective. It is this new synthesis that will be explored in the final chapter of this book.<|endoftext|>Gone are the days of fighting with finicky and slow 3D printers; with the new Prusa i3 MK3S, you get the benefits of simplicity, accessibility, and a whole lot more.

"Jonathan Chait at New York Magazine says we should start ignoring Donald Trump.\n\nTrump gets endless media coverage, which he then uses to insist he should be treated fairly by the media.\n\nThe fact that Trump is now president makes his demand for fair coverage a valid concern. So Chait’s right that ignoring Trump isn’t the solution.\n\nBut Chait is also wrong that Trump doesn’t deserve any media coverage. He’s just like any other president.\n\nJust not as good at it.\n\nChait notes that Trump uses the press to get out his message:\n\nThe president of the United States is an extremely powerful figure. Even if the entire country agrees that the president of the United States is, in fact, a buffoon who speaks only in unintelligible gibberish, the president of the United States is still very powerful.\n\nChait is correct. Trump may have been a complete loser in the private sector. But in politics, Trump’s clearly been a winner.\n\nThere are many reasons Trump has been a success in politics. Some of these reasons have to do with his political positions. But most of the reasons have to do with his personality.\n\nTrump is the ultimate salesman. He is a chameleon, able to change his tone and style to appeal to his audience. He’s also the consummate bullshit artist, able to make false promises sound plausible.\n\nAnd Trump’s made one of his signature moves since he began his political career. He completely ignores his Democratic opponents and talks directly to his voters. He’s smart enough to understand that his opponents aren’t really interested in actually talking to him.\n\nTrump has always understood how to get his message out, even if the message isn’t all that important. It’s why he never had a detailed health care plan. He wanted to talk to people who agreed with him about how terrible Obamacare was.\n\nHe’s never really been interested in a detailed plan. He’s interested in getting media coverage, because he knows the media will talk about what he says.\n\nTrump is constantly in search of free media coverage. The media gave him endless coverage during the campaign, and he won. And they’re giving him endless coverage now, and he’s still president.\n\nThe problem is that Trump is terrible at getting his message out in an organized and coherent way. He’s also terrible at actually getting anything done.\n\nTrump’s behavior is extremely damaging. But the damage doesn’t come from the fact that he’s in the news. It comes from the fact that he’s so terrible at what he does.\n\nPeople who work for him never know what’s going to come out of his mouth. And they’re never really sure what he’s going to do.\n\nBut his supporters always know where Trump stands. He’s going to get rid of illegal immigrants. He’s going to bring back jobs from overseas. He’s going to put coal miners back to work.\n\nThat’s the message he has for his supporters. And they know that even if his administration doesn’t do what he says, Trump is still fighting for them.\n\nAll presidents have to use the media to get their message out. The difference with Trump is that his message is essentially nonexistent.\n\nTrump isn’t president because he has an interesting policy agenda. He’s president because he knows how to use the media to his advantage.\n\nThat means that we have to talk about him, whether we want to or not.<|endoftext|>On the evening of October 23, 2017, the celebrated actor Will Smith hosted an invitation-only event in Las Vegas, hosted by UNICEF to support vulnerable children around the world. During his remarks, Smith reflected on his recent trip to Madagascar, where he met a family who lost their three children to diarrhea. “When I say my faith was tested, it was tested. You understand? It was like I was in the Bible.”\n\nSmith is a committed Christian. In 2007, when he was named the most bankable star in Hollywood, Smith made the bold claim that he’s the only top-grossing actor who is a professed Christian. At the time, a study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that just 18 percent of Americans consider Hollywood stars to be good role models, and just 10 percent said the same for politicians. “If the group that you are the leader of is viewed that way, you have to examine what you’re doing.” Smith said.\n\nOn this day, Smith was concerned about children around the world who are not receiving the care they need to survive. As he read about the dire need for vaccines, Smith thought about his own two kids, and how helpless he would feel if they were sick and dying. “I can’t imagine what that must be like. So for me, the easiest thing to do is to support UNICEF. Because when my children get sick, it’s my job to get them help, and if they die, they die. I’m not gonna stop that. I’m not God. But when children around the world get sick and die, it’s God’s responsibility. And I have to believe that God will ask him, ‘Are you there?’ And when He says, ‘Yes, I’m there,’ he’ll say, ‘Are you there?’ And he’ll say, ‘I’m there,’ and God will say, ‘Well, why didn’t you help these children?'”\n\nIn one year, UNICEF vaccinates 46 million children against preventable diseases. Every dollar invested in immunization results in $44 saved in treatment. UNICEF reaches children in 190 countries and territories. Each year, with the help of its many partners, UNICEF supplies more than 50 million children under the age of five with immunizations against the six life-threatening diseases: pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrhea, polio, measles, and tetanus. UNICEF also supports the vaccination of pregnant women in countries where the practice has been shown to prevent transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to newborns. In addition, UNICEF is the largest distributor of antiretroviral medicines for children and pregnant women with HIV in the developing world.\n\nUNICEF also provides thousands of training opportunities for community health workers to deliver health services to children in their own communities. UNICEF, through its extensive network of child protection partners, also provides psychological support and counselling for children and adolescents affected by violence, abuse and exploitation. For millions of children who would otherwise die, it is UNICEF that saves lives.\n\nIn response to the global refugee crisis, UNICEF is at the forefront of emergency response efforts to help children and families who are fleeing conflict and violence. The agency has distributed more than 1 million emergency packages in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan, and has provided over 1.5 million people with emergency supplies including tents, kitchen sets, heaters and sleeping mats. UNICEF has established 41 child-friendly spaces for traumatized children in the region and continues to provide medical and psychosocial support, protection and assistance for refugees.\n\nIn 2016, UNICEF’s commitment to the protection of children in conflict was formally recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Prize was awarded to UNICEF “for its work for children in developing countries, and for long-standing advocacy in favor of children’s rights.”\n\nThe U.S. and UNICEF first partnered in 1953, to help children devastated by the Korean War. From that time, their relationship has strengthened. In fiscal year 2015, the U.S. government provided UNICEF with more than $77 million to support its humanitarian efforts. UNICEF also works with the U.S. government on a number of global health initiatives. These include ensuring that every child is fully immunized and preventing HIV transmission from mother to child. UNICEF also works with the U.S. government on the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n\nThrough PEPFAR, the U.S. government has invested more than $80 billion to combat global HIV/AIDS since 2003. PEPFAR is a cornerstone of U.S. global health efforts, and it is the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease. The program provides 11 million people in over 50 countries with lifesaving antiretroviral treatment, and has contributed to a 40 percent decline in AIDS-related deaths since 2004. In fiscal year 2017, the U.S. contributed $4.2 billion to PEPFAR.\n\nChildren born with HIV and AIDS in Africa, including those living in remote rural areas, can now receive treatment. PEPFAR is working to ensure that every child is tested, identified, and started on treatment. New initiatives are also helping to treat HIV-positive mothers and prevent them from passing the virus on to their unborn children.\n\nIn the five years since the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was launched, more than 40 countries have invested in the development of a National Emergency and Medical Preparedness and Response Plan. To date, more than 15 countries have published plans. In 2016, the GHSA received a boost when the U.S. committed to invest $1.3 billion through 2020. This funding will support the purchase of 50 million doses of vaccines to help save lives from infectious diseases like"

Szerző: Király Zoltán\n\nAz elmúlt időszakban többször is már témát tettünk a honlapra, amelyekben a kivándorlás és a bevándorlás problémájáról, valamint a bevándorlás befektetési lehetőségeiről beszéltünk. Az itt szereplő írásokat mindenkit arra kérjük, hogy ismertesse ajánlásainkat, sőt: közreműködjön velük, ha és amennyiben kedve tartja. Hogy végül ez az egy kicsit kevésbé szemléletes leírás is az időszakon áttekinthető legyen, témánk megosztásával, szeretnénk színesebbé tenni azt.\n\nBevándorlás külföldön: jelentkezés az online képzésekre!\n\nEz a közel-keleti származású konzul bejelentése, hogy magyar diplomával is lehet amerikai állampolgár. Persze ez csak amolyan költséges tanúsítvány, amivel többek között az amerikaiaknál és a skót függetlenségi referendumnél is segítette ezt az országot. Nem akarunk erről semmit elárulni, mert igen sokan csak ezzel a különleges diplomával mentek tömegesen az USA-ba. Szerintünk ezt a témát egy kicsit megkönnyebbüljük, ha leiratjuk a „Re: Érdeklődés angol nyelvű műszaki képzésére” és „Re: Fókusztábor aulás képzés, IAS vagy EC” feliratokat is. Ugyanis a bevándorlás nyitott kérdés, nyilván nem tudni, hogy megmaradhat-e a hazai diákvizsga, vagy azt is el kell-e engedni, amihez a hatalom több közt képes és akar is. Úgy tűnik tehát, hogy az elmúlt időszakban nem ez a téma kapta el a fősodor fölényét, hanem inkább az, hogy a diplomákat használva bevándorlásra készülnek, mert szeretnék külföldön folytatni tanulmányaikat.\n\nDe miért is történne ennyire széleskörű bevándorlás, ami a diplomát kapók számát is magába foglalja? Mert a diplomával rendelkezők ugyan egyre kevesebben vannak, mégis akad bőven olyan, aki tud és akár öröm is a tanulás, a munka, de legalábbis a külföldi út. Ugyanis nemcsak a magyar felsőoktatás gondot szenvedett, hogy az elmúlt húsz évben az egyre képzettebb munkaerő létszám egyre csökkent, hanem még a diplomával is rendelkezők száma is egyre kisebb. Az emberek számára a külföldi pályázatokat is nézve, igazolni tudom, hogy nincs egyáltalán olyan képzés, amelynek ne lenne részben- vagy teljesen online képzése is. Ugyanis a mai informatika, oktatás és kultúra nagyon nagy szerepet kap a dolgokban, ezért érdemes elgondolkodni azon, hogy nem kell kénytelen vagy bármi okból kiszolgáltatott állapotban végezni az oktatást.\n\nAz online képzések jelentik az újat, amit ma a diplomával rendelkezők a legnagyobb arányban vesznek igénybe, és szerintem nem is egy rossz döntés, ha valaki le is teszi az online képzést. Ami még érdekesebb az egészben, az az, hogy nem csak a bevándorlásra készülnek az online képzések segítségével. Valójában még a saját országunkban is egyre több jelentkező van olyan online képzésekre, amelyekkel más országokban tömegesen jelentkeznek. Ez tehát előny és hátrány is egyben, de szerintünk a legtöbben inkább a jelentkezés következtében a szerencséjükre vannak. De hogy mi a jelentkezés eredménye? Kivándorlás vagy bevándorlás, de a legtöbb helyen egyelőre még azt sem lehet tudni, hogy van-e lehetőség a bevándorlásra, vagy sem. De a fenti címen érdemes bejelentkezni, és utánajárni, hogy van-e itt online képzés. Kérjük, hogy többször is utánajárjon, mert a keresés egy másik címre is elérhető, és egy jó okos program lehetővé teszi azt, hogy az eredmények szemléltetése legyen a lehető legjobb.\n\nA magyar diplomával is lehet amerikai állampolgár?\n\nA témát komolyan vegy"
"Twitter is the perfect platform to get the word out there about anything you are trying to promote. I am a huge fan of using Twitter as a marketing tool, even more than Facebook. It’s a great way to network and reach out to people who are interested in what you have to offer. Here is my list of 10 tips to help you promote anything you are selling on Twitter:\n\n1. Use Hashtags\n\nI love using hashtags on Twitter. They help to promote the things you are interested in and create a sense of community within a group. I will admit that it can be hard to remember hashtags to use for all the things you promote. One way I suggest to overcome this is to put your hashtags in a Twitter search to make sure they are not already being used. This will save you some time and help you avoid any issues down the road.\n\n2. Retweet\n\nIf you like a tweet, retweet it! I’m sure most people are familiar with the concept of retweeting, but I just wanted to put it out there to make sure it was stated. Retweeting is a great way to share the things you like, and can be a great way to show your audience that you are involved in the social media community and help them feel more comfortable doing business with you.\n\n3. Mention\n\nMentioning someone on Twitter is a great way to show your audience that you are engaged and want to interact with them. It is important to mention other people within your field of interest in order to show your audience that you are well connected. I always make sure to mention people who have liked or retweeted my stuff as well. It makes me feel good when I get a mention and it shows that the people I engage with are interested in what I have to say.\n\n4. Post About Your Daily Life\n\nThere is nothing wrong with posting about your daily life and about other stuff you like. I’m sure you all know about the Twitter feeds that are all business. I don’t like following people like that because I feel like it takes away from the idea of the social aspect of Twitter. By being a person and talking about your life, you can show your audience that you are a real person and are interested in other people’s lives as well. I’m sure you have seen some tweets about people’s lives that you thought were really cool, and the people that posted those tweets have engaged you because of it.\n\n5. Be Social\n\nDon’t forget to be social. I’m sure that when you first started out you didn’t know what to do on Twitter. My suggestion to you is to find some people who are interested in the things you are and start a conversation. You will see that the conversations that start on Twitter are real and can be interesting. One of my favorite things to do on Twitter is to start conversations with people. It gives me the chance to learn from other people and also helps them learn about me.\n\n6. Use Pictures\n\nI love using pictures on Twitter. I know a lot of people like to include pictures when they post about things, and I would like to suggest that you do so as well. Including a picture with your tweet can get you more retweets and likes, and can really help to boost the effectiveness of your post. I like to use pictures from Instagram with my tweets, but you can really use any picture. If you want to make a picture of yourself that has an impact on your audience, I would suggest using a tool like Socialbakers.\n\n7. Use Hashtags That Make Sense\n\nI’ve touched on this before, but I want to emphasize it again. It is important to make sure that you are using hashtags that make sense. You don’t want to hashtag your tweets with irrelevant hashtags just to get a retweet or a like. You also don’t want to make hashtags that are too long. I would suggest keeping your hashtags short and relevant.\n\n8. Direct Message\n\nThere are times when a DM is more appropriate than a tweet. You will be surprised at how many people DM you. I think a lot of people just use it to ask questions, but you can also use it to network. I think a lot of people don’t use DMs because they don’t think their audience will see it. If you are going to send a DM, make sure it is personal. Send it to someone who is following you. It’s a lot less likely that they will check the people they follow to see who is sending them a DM, so if you DM a person that is following you, they are much more likely to respond.\n\n9. Use Images\n\nI want to encourage you to use images with your tweets. Images are the first thing people look at, so you want to make sure that you are using good images. One thing I like to do is to include images with my tweets. I’m sure you have seen a lot of Twitter profiles that do this. It helps to keep your tweets interesting and make your tweets more unique.\n\n10. Be You\n\nThis last one is really important. You want to be yourself on Twitter. The more genuine you are, the better. People can see through a fake personality. You want to engage with your audience and show them who you are. When they see you as a real person, it will help to build a more trusting relationship between you and your audience.\n\nThere you have it! I hope these tips help you to improve your Twitter account and that your business gets better because of it. I always love getting comments from you all, so if you have any more suggestions or questions, feel free to drop me a comment below.<|endoftext|>Auszeichnungen\n\nBuchnerstatterin des Jahres, Österreichischer Buchpreis 2017, Österreichischer Phantastikpreis 2017, Burgenländische Literaturpreise 2017, Internationale Literaturpreise der Wiener Buchmesse 2018, österreichische Kurzgeschichtensammlung des Jahres 2017, Deutscher Phantastik Preis 2018\n\nAwards\n\nAustrian Book Prize 2017, Austrian Fantasy Award 2017, Burgenland Literary Prize 2017, International Literary Awards of the Vienna Book Fair 2018, Austrian Short Story Collection of the Year 2017, German Fantasy Award 2018\n\nThema des Monats<|endoftext|>Watermelon Fried Rice\n\nPrint This\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 can chicken broth\n\n1 lb boneless chicken, cut in strips\n\n3 cups cooked rice\n\n2 tablespoons butter\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n3/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped\n\n2 cups watermelon, seeded and chopped\n\n2 green onions, sliced\n\n3/4 cup red bell pepper, seeded and chopped\n\n1/2 cup red onion, diced\n\n1/4 cup cashews\n\n1/4 cup raisins\n\nDirections:\n\nCombine chicken broth and chicken in a bowl.

First of all, you're expected to wear a hideous dress that you've never worn before. Second, you're required to spend your evening catering to everyone else, acting as the host of the event. Most importantly, however, you're required to smile a lot and appear happy.\n\nAt the wedding I attended, everyone was happy, especially the bride and groom. I was happy for them, but I wasn't the happiest bridesmaid in the crowd. In fact, I was the exact opposite.\n\nWhy was I so unhappy? I wasn't the one getting married; I was the maid of honor. I was so annoyed that I was even standing up for my ex. We'd broken up last month because I thought he was cheating on me with a blonde bimbo named Summer. I was at the wedding because my best friend Alicia insisted that I go, but if she knew how much I hated the groom, she would have probably asked me not to go at all.\n\nAnyway, this was the part of the wedding that was pissing me off: the proposal. I was trying my hardest to hold back my tears, but I was failing. I didn't love him anymore, and I never would again.\n\nI glanced over at my ex-boyfriend, Blake. He was really handsome, but that's not what was important right now. He was going down on one knee and was about to propose to the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.\n\n\"Andi, will you marry me?\"\n\nI cringed. He'd asked me the same question about ten times, but I was too busy being angry at him to remember. This time was different, however, because he was now asking the blonde bimbo he was sleeping with.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, finally accepting the proposal.\n\nAs soon as he slid the ring on her finger, everyone in the room erupted into cheers. I just stood there, my mouth wide open, in complete shock.\n\n\"Yes, that's my girl,\" said Blake, \"And now she's my fiancée!\"\n\nAs they walked out of the church and into the limo, Blake leaned over and kissed her cheek. A couple seconds later, I lost it.\n\n\"Bastard,\" I muttered. \"Bastard.\"\n\n\"Andrea?\" said Alicia.\n\n\"He just asked that whore to marry him,\" I said. \"It was my turn. I was the one who should have been there. I'm the one who was supposed to marry him!\"\n\n\"Yeah, well I know that,\" she said, rolling her eyes. \"But it's over now. You just have to be a big girl and accept it.\"\n\n\"He doesn't love her,\" I said, \"I know it. He was with her while he was with me, remember?\"\n\n\"Andi, I hate to say this, but it's too late now,\" she said. \"He's getting married. You can't do anything about it.\"\n\n\"I could show up at the wedding,\" I said, \"and say that I'm his girlfriend and I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\"Andi, that's insane,\" she said. \"You know it's not your baby. You're going to destroy his wedding day if you pull something like that.\"\n\n\"That's the point,\" I said. \"I want him to feel the way I feel. I want him to feel miserable for a change.\"\n\n\"Look,\" she said, \"I'll go with you, but you can't tell Blake anything. If you do, you're going to be the biggest loser in the room, and you're going to lose your best friend.\"\n\nI hesitated. I knew she was right. If I ruined the wedding, I'd be in a lot of trouble.\n\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"I won't tell him anything.\"\n\nA few days later, I arrived at the church. The doors were open, so I wandered in. The church was completely empty, which made it look a lot bigger. I could hear some talking coming from the altar, so I walked in that direction. The first person I saw was Blake, wearing a brand new suit and looking like the happiest man on the planet.\n\n\"You look so beautiful,\" he said to the blonde bimbo who stood next to him.\n\nI thought I would be furious when I saw her, but I wasn't. I was heartbroken and sad, but I didn't hate her. In fact, I didn't feel anything towards her. I was just jealous, and the sight of her made me remember how much I'd wanted to marry Blake myself.\n\nI walked up the aisle, ignoring the fact that I was completely alone. I sat down in the front row, and began to think about what had happened.\n\n\"How did it happen?\" I said to myself. \"Why did we break up?\"\n\nI knew that I loved him, but I was certain he didn't love me. My best friend Alicia and I had discussed it, and she agreed with me. She was convinced that Blake was cheating on me with a blonde bimbo named Summer, but I wasn't convinced.\n\n\"It can't be her,\" I said. \"How did he meet her? Where did they meet?\"\n\nJust then, a woman walked up to the front of the church. She was dressed in a black robe, and she had short, black hair.\n\n\"Are you Andrea?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"but the wedding has been cancelled.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"Blake is getting married in Las Vegas,\" she said.\n\n\"But I'm his fiancée,\" I said, \"And I'm supposed to be here.\"\n\n\"You were never his fiancée,\" she said. \"The bimbo, Summer, is the one he's getting married to.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Neither do I,\" she said, \"but I was supposed to tell you the wedding was cancelled. So, that's what I'm doing. Sorry for ruining your night.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" I said. \"It's not your fault.\"\n\nI knew I had to get out of there. I could barely stand being there as it was, so I hurried out the door. I walked down the sidewalk, not knowing where I was going.

I'm just here because your father paid for the wedding.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" he said. \"We're getting married in Las Vegas tonight.\"\n\n\"Really?\" I said.\n\n\"Andi, we've got to go,\" he said, \"it's going to start any second.\"\n\nI took one look at his face, and I knew that he was telling the truth. I felt the tears well up in my eyes.\n\n\"So, this is it?\" I said. \"You're really getting married?\"\n\n\"Andi, I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't know how to tell you. My father forced me into this, and I couldn't say no. If I had it my way, you'd be my wife right now. But this is the way it has to be.\"\n\nI felt a tear escape my eye, and I quickly wiped it away.\n\n\"You look beautiful,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not going,\" I"

This book wasn't hot and steamy. Not even a little bit. There was one sexy scene between Jay and Davey but that was about it. But it was such a great story. The storyline kept me interested the whole time and I was really rooting for them to have their happily ever after.\n\n\n\nDavey just recently moved from Ireland to get away from his family and the drama that comes with them. He loves working at a video game store and is really happy there. He has a steady boyfriend but that doesn't mean that Davey is 100% out of the closet. Jay is his friend from work but Davey doesn't know that Jay is in love with him.\n\n\n\nJay is totally in love with his best friend Davey. He thinks that Davey is perfect but he can tell that Davey is hiding something. Davey has a hard time trusting people and Jay doesn't know why. But Jay can tell that Davey is hiding something so he just decides to wait it out until Davey is ready to tell him. He's hoping that one day, Davey will realize that Jay is in love with him and he will finally be able to be with the man he loves.\n\n\n\nI really liked the characters. I felt really bad for Davey and how his family was treating him. I also really liked Jay. He was such a great guy. He was just really honest about his feelings for Davey. And I loved that about him.\n\n\n\nIt was a really great story. I loved the characters, I loved the storyline, and I was really rooting for these two to be together.<|endoftext|>La ministre fédérale de la Santé, Maggie De Block (Open VLD), n'entend pas se mettre à genoux devant les réclamations de ceux qui réclament un déremboursement du soin médical de base. \"J'entends les gens, mais je pense qu'il faut se tourner vers d'autres solutions\", explique-t-elle au soir de l'anniversaire de la prise du pouvoir par le nouveau gouvernement de coalition fédéral. \"Je vais en débattre avec les partenaires sociaux, dans la société civile, avec les élus régionaux et les élus locaux\", ajoute-t-elle.\n\nLes chiffres sont là. Selon les calculs de la Drees, le coût du maintien du système de soin de base en Belgique est de 2,8 milliards d'euros par an. Une somme qui n'est pas forcément optimale dans un contexte budgétaire tendu. En 2014, par exemple, des remboursements aussi massifs ont provoqué un manque à gagner de 1,1 milliard d'euros pour le gouvernement fédéral. Un déficit qui s'ajoute au budget annuel d'environ 21,5 milliards d'euros de la santé publique.\n\nLa ministre se montre prudente, parce qu'il ne faut pas se tromper de combat. Il ne s'agit pas de réformer le système de soins de base pour une raison financière, mais pour l'améliorer, précise-t-elle. \"Je ne suis pas pour le déremboursement de la médecine de base, mais je veux prendre un nouveau départ, et que tout le monde y trouve son compte\", ajoute-t-elle.\n\nMaggie De Block a d'ailleurs entamé une série de consultations, avant de rendre son rapport final. A ses yeux, le \"temps de l'improvisation est passé\", car les gens attendent des résultats concrets. Le gouvernement libéral flamand et le PS, ainsi que des institutions nationales, mais aussi internationales, auront leur mot à dire dans ce débat.<|endoftext|>Hello, I hope I'm posting this in the right area, I'm not sure. But I am in a bit of a predicament. I got my first laptop (Dell Inspiron 15R) for Christmas, and when I put it on my first university assignment it worked fine, for like 3 days. Then all of a sudden it starts turning off by itself. I've tried it on multiple chargers and outlets, still the same. I then found out that the reason why it would do this was because I had the processor set on High Performance, which I've now changed to Balanced, but that's still not fixed the problem. I have had this laptop for 2 weeks, and it's really beginning to make me feel insecure in a laptop.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know what this could be, and how to fix it?

Już niebawem w Olsztynie!\n\nZdjęcia z filmu zrealizowane przez Alfonso Cuaróna, do którego grają gwiazdy jak Daniel Radcliffe czy Emma Watson, zapowiadają się niezwykle okazałe. Zaangażowanie mieszkańców, światło, charakterystyczne elementy miasta będą w tym filmie częścią wizualnej uczty dla każdego fanu Harry’ego Pottera.\n\nPlanowana datą startu projektu jest październik 2019 roku. Projekt będzie realizowany przez Filmowy Obóz Gier, Współpracujących ze Stacją Filmoznawczą im. Andrzeja Wajdy i Stowarzyszenie Pomocy Inicjatywom Kulturalnym Miasta Olsztyna.\n\n- Miejscem realizacji filmu będzie miasto Olsztyn, zarówno starówka, jak i inne części miasta, a prawdopodobnie także same Podlasie. Trudno jednoznacznie wskazać przeznaczone obszary, gdyż pozyskamy najlepsze miejsca do filmowania. W pobliżu rzek, na szlakach turystycznych, w zabytkowych okolicznościach, w obiektach, które byłyby dostępne dla produkcji, przy budynkach kulturalnych, w wojskowych obiektach - mówi Mariusz Łazicki, prezes Filmowego Obozu Gier.\n\nTymczasem początek pracy twórców zaplanowany jest na 21 września w Centrum Kultury w Olsztynie. Wejście na teren projektu jest bezpłatne, a pierwsze próby rozpocznie się w październiku, równolegle z realizacją obiektu.\n\nPodczas wyprawy filmowców po Europie, pracę twórców poprowadzi amerykański reżyser.\n\nWśród uczestników będzie miała również swoje miejsce Olsztyńska Fabryka Form Filmowych - eksperymentalna scenografia - największy tego typu obiekt w Europie.\n\n- Ten nowy obszar pracy filmowej przejdzie gruntowną renowację, w tym nowa przepustowość dla tłumu widzów. Olsztyn i teren przy Fabryce Form Filmowych wyróżniają się na tle innych miast w Polsce, ale i w Europie. Dzisiaj już niebawem możemy wystawić szyld w kraju i na świecie - mówi Łazicki.\n\nOd 2008 roku, czyli od czasu pojawienia się pierwszych prac reżyserskich w tym miejscu, powstaje kilkanaście prac, dzięki czemu ma miejsce w Europie, wykorzystywane na potrzeby filmowe i komercyjne.\n\nObecnie w przyszłym roku zaplanowana jest realizacja kolejnego filmu o losach czarodziejki, gdzie Olsztyn będzie głównym miejscem akcji.\n\n- Jedna z produkcji ma za zadanie pokazać mieszkańcom miasta, a za pośrednictwem filmu z całego świata, jak Olsztyn został wybrany do filmowania. W przyszłości obiekt wykorzystany jest do realizacji dalszych produkcji z unikalnym potencjałem. Takie miejsce ma szansę powstać tylko raz na kontynencie - podsumowuje prezes.\n\nW przyszłości, w obiekcie będą realizowane kolejne filmy, nie tylko te komercyjne.\n\n- Konsekwencją pojawienia się Fabryki Form Filmowych, jest potrzeba dalszej rozbudowy obiektu. Twórcy nie zapomną o Olsztynie. Chcą, aby fabryka stała się prężnie działającą wydarzeniem kulturalnym i edukacyjnym, dającym pracę tysiącom ludzi w Polsce. Jak i też nie zapominają, że fabryka powstała dzięki Polakom, którzy działali w tym miejscu pod nazwą Fabryka Filmowa \"Kolor\" - mówi prezes.<|endoftext|>Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\nTimeless creator Eric Kripke wants a season 4 to resolve the show's cliffhanger ending.\n\nThe time-travel series, starring Abigail Spencer, Matt Lanter, Malcolm Barrett and Goran Visnjic, was canceled after two seasons on NBC. However, after a last-minute bid from Sony Pictures Television, it was ordered to a special two-part finale. The shows were meant to resolve the cliffhanger, and answer why Rufus was shot and where Lucy and Wyatt ended up. However, when the episode aired, nothing was resolved.\n\nRelated: Timeless Fits Perfectly Into The Revival TV Movement\n\nIn an interview with Syfy Wire, Kripke revealed he's hoping for a season 4 so that the show can get a proper ending.\n\n\"We always conceived of [the finale] as a potential series finale, because we couldn’t get canceled! So that’s just what it ended up being. It’s like, “OK, we can’t end the show, so let’s end the arc.” It felt really appropriate and full circle, and everybody at NBC, Sony and Warner Bros. was like, “That’s a perfect place to end this.” We’re not ruling out a future for the show. Who knows? We still feel passionately about it. Maybe there will be a season 4. I think everyone at the studio and the network felt really good about where it ended.”\n\nIf"

"A/N: Before I start, I must confess. I lied. In an interview with Josh Radnor from earlier this year, he claimed he would only do a spin-off if it was centered around Ted and Barney, with the two of them going off to some far off place (New Zealand? Australia?) where they lived in a beach house and watched sports. I laughed. A lot. And now that I have come up with a sequel for The Only Person Who Didn't Run from Ted Mosby, I don't really have a plot for it...\n\n(Disclaimer: This is a work of fan fiction. Any resemblance to any other work of fiction is entirely coincidental. Not to mention a little insulting)\n\nI sat on my bed, looking down at my phone. There was only one person who could help me write this...\n\nI knew it was kind of a lame excuse. I mean, my sister works at a museum, for Pete's sake. She can't help me with a stupid paper. What was I thinking? And I had a really good excuse to tell my girlfriend when I get home. We had a date. But, in order to give me that good excuse, I have to write this stupid paper and get it done. I have to talk to my sister.\n\nI dialed the number to my sister's work, and it started ringing. My sister, Gloria, picked up.\n\n\"What's up, D?\"\n\n\"Glor, do you think you can help me with a paper? I really need some help.\"\n\n\"Sure. What is it about?\"\n\n\"It's a paper about JFK.\"\n\n\"Oh. Cool. Yeah, sure. What do you need?\"\n\n\"I need some help finding some good sources for this. I need to know how to start a paper.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you asked.\"\n\nAnd I was off to a good start. I sat at my desk, making notes. The paper was going to be really easy to write. It would probably only take a couple hours. I knew it. And I would be home before Lily.\n\nThe paper was starting to look really good. I had a bibliography in place, a couple of good paragraphs, and a nice introduction. Everything was great.\n\nI had a paper ready to turn in the next morning. It was almost done, and I was free to go home. But I had a date to get to.\n\n\"Bartender!\" I called. \"One more, please!\"\n\n\"You sure, man? You're not gonna make it home tonight.\"\n\n\"Nah, man. It's all good. I'll just be getting home, like, ten minutes later than I would.\"\n\n\"Okay, man. Whatever you say.\"\n\nI started walking out the door, but I took the bar stool with me. I had to carry it around to make it look like I was in a drunken stupor. If my girlfriend saw that I was drunk when I got home, I would never be able to keep my secret.\n\nAs I made my way through the train station, I heard a strange beeping sound. I turned my head to the side, trying to find the source of the noise. It was coming from my phone. There was a text message. I opened my phone, and read it.\n\nI was starting to feel a little tipsy. It was a good thing I was carrying a bar stool around. It made me look like I had a reason for not walking right.\n\nThe message was from Lily. I read it.\n\nThe good thing about living in New York was the night life. I was lucky enough to be able to spend an evening at a nightclub, so I would be home in no time.\n\n\"Yeah, man,\" I said. \"I don't know why I even did this, dude.\"\n\nI walked out of the nightclub and back into the train station. I knew it was late, but the train wasn't too crowded. I sat down in a seat, trying to get some sleep. I would be home soon enough.\n\nI woke up as the train pulled into the station. I was close to home now. It was getting a little crowded on the train, but I managed to squeeze myself into the seat. I was a little more aware of the fact that I was still carrying my bar stool, but I decided to go on anyway.\n\nI stumbled out of the train station, still carrying the bar stool. I made my way through the crowd, out into the parking lot, and across the street to my car. I put the bar stool in the trunk, and got in the car. I turned on the engine, and drove off.\n\n\"Hey, Lily. Yeah, I'm on my way home. I'm sorry, but I ran into some trouble. It shouldn't take me long to get home.\"\n\n\"You said that you were just going to be a few minutes late. You said you were on your way home, and then you don't show up for three hours. You call me and say you're sorry? That doesn't even make sense!\"\n\n\"I know, I know. It's just that it took me a little longer to get home than I thought.\"\n\n\"You lied to me! You said you were going to be home at 8:30! I waited until midnight! You were just trying to get out of our date!\"\n\n\"It wasn't like that, Lily. I had some trouble with a paper, and then I was at a nightclub. I had a lot of stuff on my mind.\"\n\n\"So, you didn't want to come home. You just didn't want to spend time with me. And now you're calling me after it's all over and trying to explain yourself. And I don't want to hear it! Goodbye!\"\n\nI was standing at the door to my apartment, keys in my hand, when I heard my phone ring. It was Lily. I stood there for a moment, trying to decide whether or not I should answer. I looked down at the floor, and then back at my phone. I answered.\n\n\"Lily, I-\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear it, Ted. I told you that I don't want to hear it.\"\n\n\"No, no, it's just that I really have to tell you something. I can't wait until tomorrow. I really need to tell you right now.\"\n\n\"Well, fine.

"Former Arizona Sen. John McCain died after a yearlong battle with brain cancer.\n\nMy fellow Republicans, John McCain was a true American hero. https://t.co/YlNEJ2KRAS — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) August 26, 2018\n\nArizona Sen. John McCain, the maverick Republican whose war record and outspokenness against abuses of power made him an American icon, died on Saturday. He was 81.In a statement, McCain’s office said he died at 4:28 pm local time at the family’s home in Arizona surrounded by family members. The cause of death was not immediately known.The former Navy pilot, who was imprisoned and tortured during the Vietnam War, rose to the top of American politics after emerging as a prominent critic of President Donald Trump.An upstart presidential bid in 2000 did not succeed but after he won the Republican nomination in 2008, he lost to Democrat Barack Obama.Despite the loss, his image soared and he emerged as one of the most influential members of the Senate, willing to work with Democrats on issues like campaign finance reform.By the time he ran for president again in 2016, he seemed like a throwback to a bygone era of civility and bipartisanship. McCain ran against Obama again in 2008.He continued to play a pivotal role in American politics, becoming chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee after the Republicans regained control of the Senate in 2015.McCain in the past had been a thorn in the side of Republican presidents — George W. Bush and Trump.He was also well known for reaching across the aisle.He took a secret trip to visit Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad during the early years of the country’s civil war, and was one of the final Republicans to speak with the president before his firing last year.He was a long-time critic of the U.S. use of torture against detainees.He held out against Republicans’ efforts to dismantle Obama’s signature healthcare legislation and refused to support the Graham-Cassidy bill last year.He was a harsh critic of Russia, and one of the earliest supporters of sanctions against Russian officials. He played a role in seeking to keep the United States from launching a pre-emptive attack against North Korea in the face of its nuclear provocations.McCain was one of the first Republicans to support Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. But when the “Access Hollywood” tape emerged, he withdrew his support, and famously said in his 2017 memoir “The Restless Wave,” “I do not know how I could have spoken so disrespectfully about the commander in chief of the Armed Forces.”He also repeatedly denounced what he called Trump’s “cheap rhetoric and insults” against U.S. allies, and after Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2018, called it a “tragic mistake.” He was one of the loudest Republican voices criticizing the president for his performance at a summit with Putin in Helsinki.Trump mocked him as “a clown,” and even at the end of his life, he was still a target for the president, who reportedly resisted hosting a state funeral.On Saturday, Trump said he sent his “deepest sympathies and respect” to McCain’s family.“The nation mourns the loss of a great American patriot, a statesman who put his country first and enriched this nation every day he served.”Former President Barack Obama called him a “giant of American politics,” and his one-time opponent in the 2008 presidential race said he was “a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order.”Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, called McCain “an American hero” on Twitter.McCain’s funeral service will be held at the Washington National Cathedral and the ceremony will include eulogies from former President George W. Bush, former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Sen. Joe Lieberman, the former vice-presidential candidate who was a close friend.After the service, he will be buried in Annapolis, Md., at the U.S. Naval Academy.McCain was born at a naval station in the Panama Canal Zone, where his father was stationed. After his father’s career in the Navy, the family settled in the Arizona desert, where he attended high school.McCain studied at the Naval Academy and became a pilot in the Navy, serving on a ship that was shot down in Vietnam. He spent five-and-a-half years in captivity, which included torture, before he was released in 1973.McCain returned to the U.S. and was assigned to the Senate as a liaison to the Navy. He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1983 and eventually the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce.During his 2008 presidential bid, he secured the GOP nomination in the face of much skepticism. At a dinner in 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama joked that after losing to Obama, McCain would be on a beach sipping a drink with “an umbrella in it.”The Republican-led Senate, which was much closer to McCain than to the president, overwhelmingly passed a resolution earlier this year that censured Trump for his “bigoted and racist” remarks about four members of Congress.In his memoir, McCain said that he regretted that his choice of Sarah Palin as a running mate did not propel him to the White House. He said he made the choice based on who he thought could become president, but that was wrong.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

"Power Consumption\n\nIdle: Windows Vista Aero sitting at the desktop (1280x1024 32-bit) all windows closed, drivers installed. Card left to warm up in idle mode until power draw was stable.\n\nMulti-monitor: Two monitors connected to the tested card, both using different display timings. Windows Vista Aero sitting at the desktop (1280x1024 32-bit) all windows closed, drivers installed. Card left to warm up in idle mode until power draw was stable.\n\nAverage: Crysis 2 at 1920x1200, Extreme profile, representing a typical gaming power draw. Average of all readings (12 per second) while the benchmark was rendering (no title/loading screen).\n\nPeak: Crysis 2 at 1920x1200, Extreme profile, representing a typical gaming power draw. Highest single reading during the test.\n\nMaximum: Furmark Stability Test at 1280x1024, 0xAA. This results in a very high non-game power-consumption that can typically be reached only with stress-testing applications. Card left running stress-test until power draw converged to a stable value.\n\nBlu-ray Playback: Power DVD 9 Ultra was used at a resolution of 1920x1200 to play back the Batman: The Dark Knight disc with GPU acceleration turned on. Playback started around timecode 1:19, which has the highest data rates on the BD with up to 40 Mb/s. Playback was left running until power draw converged to a stable value.\n\nCooling modern video cards is becoming more and more difficult, especially when users are asking for quiet cooling solutions. That's why the engineers are now paying much more attention to power consumption of new video-card designs.For this test, we measured the power consumption of the graphics card only via the PCI-Express power connector(s) and PCI-Express bus slot. A Keithley Integra 2700 digital multimeter with 6.5-digit resolution was used for all measurements. Again, the values here reflect only the power consumption of the card measured at DC VGA card inputs, not of the whole system.We choseas a standard test representing typical 3D gaming usage because it offers the following: very high power draw; high repeatability; is a current game that is supported on all cards because of its DirectX 9 roots; drivers are actively tested and optimized for it; supports all multi-GPU configurations; test runs in a relatively short time and renders a non-static scene with variable complexity.To measure the power consumption of our testbed we used a digital power meter (Keithley Integra 2700) connected before the power supply. The power consumption measurement of the system is based on the power consumption of the drives, not of the graphics cards. All cards were tested with a total of four SSDs: one in the system, one used as a primary test drive in a slot without a powered connector, and two additional drives in the system (not used for testing). The SSDs are Western Digital WD360GD (362GB), WD1500HLHX (150GB), Samsung SSD 830 (128GB) and OCZ Agility 3 (240GB).Idle power consumption of the whole test system (at the desktop) is measured after sitting idle at the desktop for 30 minutes. The cards are not closed. The result is presented as the average value of all four cards.Please note that after extensive testing, we found that measuring idle power consumption only, as seen in many other reviews, can be misleading. Due to different testing methodology and environments, this number can be significantly lower than the real power consumption. Also, in many cases, the card does not reach the desired idle temperature, so it will draw more power. In our test setup, the cards reach their idle temperature very quickly (in a few minutes) and in a climate controlled room (22°C).Therefore, we use this only as a rough indication of the cards' power consumption.Please note we are using different adjustements to test the performance of our graphics cards. Our testing methodology is detailed here . It's worth mentioning that our method allows us to perform a more thorough test that's free from GPU bottlenecks. It's also free from variations caused by dual-gpu/hybrid configurations.The following two values are the peak power consumption and the maximum power consumption of our testbed (without speakers/headphones) measured after long periods of use (at least 15 minutes) with Windows Aero enabled. The peak power consumption is the maximum power draw of the graphics card only, measured in the most stressful situation (generally, when it's overclocked). The maximum power consumption is the maximum power draw of the complete testbed, including the monitor, speakers, hard-disk, SSD, etc.The results are impressive. Idle power consumption is a tiny bit higher than that of the GTX 580. All cards operate at fairly low power levels in idle. NVIDIA has done a good job reducing idle power consumption of its GTX 680. Under full load, the GTX 680 is only slightly more power hungry than the GTX 580. Compared to AMD, the GTX 680 fares even better as it uses slightly less power than the HD 7970.All graphics cards tested consume quite a lot of power during Blu-ray playback. Interestingly, this is one area where NVIDIA can't keep up with AMD.<|endoftext|>This is an experiment in one-shot plays.

Kearney\n\nStephen Watts Kearney (June 17, 1794 – October 31, 1848) was an officer in the United States Army who is best known for his leadership in the Mexican–American War, in particular the Battle of Monterrey and the Battle of Buena Vista.\n\nKearney was born in Newark, New Jersey. He was a descendant of John Kearney (1635–1701), a native of Ireland who was the first of the family to settle in what became the United States. John's son Richard (1668–1734) was born in Bristol, England, but became a fur trader in what was then the English colonies and later became New Jersey. Richard was commissioned as an ensign by British colonial governor Jonathan Belcher in 1709.\n\nRichard's son James (1703–1785) was a general in the New Jersey colonial militia during the French and Indian War. James's son Stephen Watts Kearny, the namesake of the general, was a captain in the War of Independence and was at the surrender of General John Burgoyne. His home, the Kearney Mansion, has since been preserved in Newark.\n\nIn 1794 he moved with his parents to Louisville, Kentucky. His father, Alexander Morris Kearney, a native of South Carolina, was a captain in the American Revolutionary War. In the War of 1812, Kearney participated in the Battle of Lundy's Lane, where he was wounded and captured by the British. After being released, he joined the Missouri Rangers and, in 1813, married Mary Radcliffe Matthews. In 1814 he joined the 5th United States Infantry as its sixth lieutenant and served in the war against the Creek nation. In 1819 he was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Infantry. Kearney resigned from the Army in 1822 and became superintendent of Indian affairs at St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIn 1832 Kearney was appointed as governor of the New Mexico Territory, where he was active in promoting settlement and negotiating treaties with the Native Americans. Kearney participated in the Gila Expedition of 1837 and then commanded the Army's Third Dragoon Regiment in Florida in 1837 and 1838.\n\nDuring the Mexican–American War, Kearney was appointed colonel of the 1st New York Dragoons on June 30, 1846. Kearney's new regiment was sent to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to reinforce the Army of New Mexico under Col. Stephen Watts Kearny (no relation). There they joined the march on the capital of Mexico City. On the way, Kearney's regiment carried out several successful raids, including the Battle of La Mesa, where he captured a large amount of ammunition and supplies. He took the Puebla de Los Angeles without opposition on December 7, 1846. There he received word that his promotion to brigadier general had been approved.\n\nKearny, reinforced by the 3rd Infantry and Mormon Battalion, took the city of Monterrey on September 25, 1846. During the battle, a cannonball tore away part of Kearny's jaw and neck.\n\nFollowing the battle, Kearney was carried to Saltillo for medical treatment. While he was recovering, Lt. Colonel John Garland was given command of the 1st Dragoons. In February 1847, Kearney returned to the army and resumed command of the dragoons. Kearney served in the Battle of Buena Vista, and later he fought in the Taos Revolt. He returned to the United States in October 1847 and was assigned to Fort Leavenworth in the Kansas Territory.\n\nKearney, a bachelor, died of cholera at Fort Leavenworth at the age of 54. He was buried in the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery.\n\nSeveral U.S. Army installations are named in honor of Kearney, including Kearney Barracks in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, the Kearney Building at Fort Leavenworth, and Fort Kearny, Nebraska, which is now a state historic site.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Los Ríos Province, Chile\n\nLos Ríos (Spanish for \"The Rivers\") is one of four provinces in the southern Chilean region of Los Ríos (IV).

"In many places there are no longer any young men at all. According to the World Health Organization, \"in countries with very low fertility, the proportion of young people may halve in the next 40 years\". At this rate, by 2100 a majority of the world's population will be over 50. We will then have to find a way to accommodate the needs and aspirations of an unprecedented number of very old people in a society that has been moulded for decades around the needs of youth.\n\nNowhere is this more true than in Japan, the world's fastest-ageing country. The greying of Japan – \"silver tsunami\" or \"grey goo\" as it is known – is by now well known. There are a number of reasons for this. Japanese have one of the longest life expectancies in the world, with women expected to live to 87 and men to 80. Meanwhile, a long-standing national emphasis on having small families and long working hours – for both men and women – have kept the birth rate below replacement levels. And Japan's postwar economic miracle has not been kind to the young. The country's population is shrinking, partly because of a low birth rate and partly because of a high level of immigration.\n\nBut what is less well known is that this graying of Japan – and other nations such as Germany, China, South Korea and Thailand – is not just due to longer life expectancy and lower birth rates. There is another factor in play, and one that could have dramatic implications: very low fertility rates, particularly among younger women. It's estimated that around a quarter of the population will be aged over 65 by 2050.\n\nIn Japan, the \"total fertility rate\" (the number of children a woman is likely to have in her lifetime) is just 1.4 – and has been for the past 20 years. Among women aged between 15 and 24, the rate is even lower at 0.8, lower even than the famously low rate in Germany (which is 1.38). And in Tokyo, that rate is even lower at 0.7. By contrast, in 2010, the average rate in Europe was 1.6. The fertility rate in England and Wales in 2010 was 1.9.\n\nThe world's media are full of breathless stories about Japan's crisis of depopulation. Last year, an article in the International Business Times said that \"Japanese women are rejecting marriage and motherhood at a staggering rate\". In the New York Times, another piece claimed that Japan is \"exporting its young women\" and is now \"facing a demographic crisis of epic proportions\". More soberly, the BBC's business editor Robert Peston has written: \"Without a dramatic increase in its birth rate, Japan will face economic and social ruin.\"\n\nThe sense of panic is understandable. \"The number of young people will go down by two-thirds by 2035,\" says demographer Toshio Kanazawa. \"That means not only a decline in the size of the workforce but a dramatic increase in the number of retirees. Who will pay for them?\"\n\nThe answer is \"women\" – or more specifically, their wombs. And in this, there is something not quite right.\n\nIn Tokyo, I meet Nana, a 29-year-old who is employed in the financial sector. She is smartly dressed in a suit and speaks good English. She tells me she has a boyfriend and they are very happy. She is, she says, the typical \"She Economy\" – a young woman working in the city and her parents are very pleased. \"They want me to settle down,\" she says, \"and have children.\" But she's not so sure.\n\n\"It's too late,\" she says. \"I've got to think of my future. And I just don't know if I could afford it – having children. I'd need a bigger flat, and pay for childcare, and a new car.\"\n\nFor Nana, and for many Japanese women like her, the economic reality of having children is daunting. \"I have two brothers,\" she says, \"and they have wives and children. The wives don't work, and they have one or two children. One of my sisters-in-law doesn't even work outside the house. They don't have much money, but my parents love them. They are very happy. So I know what my parents want for me. But it's impossible. I can't do it.\"\n\nThis is a scenario that is playing out in homes across the country. The situation is, in many respects, rather unique. As Peston points out, Japanese women who stay in employment tend to have children later. As a result, while there is a generation of Japanese in their early 30s who have given up on having children, there is a generation of younger women who are still trying to get pregnant.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much impossible to have two or three children in Tokyo,\" says Seiko, a 35-year-old marketing executive. \"I don't think I could afford it. You have to pay so much for childcare. And then, you've got to give up work. I just couldn't do it.\n\n\"But, still, my mother is pressuring me to have children. If you have a boyfriend, you can't get married. It's impossible. You have to marry first, then have children. So, if you are a working woman, you have to get married, have children, and then stay at home with your children. That's it. And that's what everyone wants. That's the ideal.\"\n\nAt the root of this ideal is Japan's traditional gender-role society – one that has stayed remarkably the same since the end of the second world war. It is not, perhaps, surprising that such a rigid society is under strain. And not only for women. It is also under strain for men.\n\n\"Women in Japan are not treated well,\" says Toshio Kanazawa. \"They don't earn a lot of money. They are discriminated against in many ways. That's why there aren't enough babies.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees. \"I don't think it's true,\" says Nana, who, I've noticed, has referred to herself as \"boku\" (which means \"I\") all evening, rather than the more feminine \"watashi\" (which means \"I\"). \"Women in Japan are strong. They do well at work and they earn a lot of money. They can do everything. So why should they have children?\"\n\nIn some respects, Nana has a point. Japan is a country in which young women are breaking glass ceilings. The number of women in senior management in Japan's 3,000 largest companies is at a record high. And in 2013, the World Economic Forum rated Japan the fourth most \"gender-equal\" nation in the world.\n\nThe Japanese government has encouraged this development. Ever since the Second World War, successive prime ministers have tried to get more women into the workplace and have even gone so far as to tell men to \"say goodbye to their bonuses if they refuse to let their wives and daughters work outside the home\".\n\nBut while some Japanese women are finding their way into senior positions, many are also facing a harsh reality: most large Japanese corporations have an unofficial \"marriage bar\" that prohibits the promotion of women who are married and have children. This is particularly true of men. According to a study by the Japanese government, 61.5 per cent of male managers are married. By contrast, only 42.2 per cent of female managers are married. This means that women with children can be in a very difficult position, because – as Shihoko Goto of the Wilson Center points out – they face a choice between marriage and career. And that is not a choice that men face.\n\n\"If you look at people in their 30s,\" says Seiko, \"I think many of them are not getting married and having children. If you don't have children, you have more time and money to enjoy your life. So why not?\n\n\"I don't think that women are rejecting marriage and family,\" she says. \"It's just that if you want children and you are a career woman, it's impossible. There is no way. You can't do both. And so you have to make a choice. Either you go for your career or you go for marriage and family. That's what I think is happening.\"\n\n\"In Japan,\" says Goto, \"it's very difficult for men and women to be able to balance work and family. So, if you are a career woman, you will have to sacrifice family. That's the problem. That's why so many women don't have children. Because they want to focus on their career.\"\n\nThis is a view echoed by Ai Kato, a 29-year-old tax accountant. \"It's true that if you work in a large Japanese company, you cannot get married or have children if you want to keep your job,\" she says. \"That's the reality. It's a matter of the company culture. It's difficult to balance both. And so people are having fewer children.\"\n\nJapan has never really known anything else. \"Since the Meiji era [from 1868 to 1912] Japan's population has been very stable,\" says Kanazawa. \"So they think that is normal. But it's not. If you look at Germany, their population is falling too, but they are getting immigrants. And in the US and the UK, the population is stable, but people are having more children. So there are many different types of demographic change, and Japan is one of the most extreme.\"\n\nWhat is less clear is why this is happening. The popular explanation is that Japan is a victim of the phenomenon known as the \"demographic time bomb\" or \""
"Australian Computer Emergency Response Team\n\nThe Australian Computer Emergency Response Team (AusCERT) is the recognised national computer security incident response team of the Australian Government. AusCERT works closely with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the Department of Defence (Defence), the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), and other government departments and agencies to deal with computer security incidents on an operational level. The organisation also provides specialist security incident response advice and services to the private sector.\n\nAusCERT was established in 1987 under the auspices of the Australian Computer Society (ACS) and is funded by the Australian Government through the Department of Communications and the Australian Government Information Management Office (AGIMO).\n\nAusCERT provides services to the public and private sectors in the following areas:\n\nThe headquarters for AusCERT are in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, and are situated at the ACS Victoria. Other AusCERT team members are located around the country, including in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Australian federal government recognised the need for a computer emergency response capability and developed the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) concept. The first CERT team was established in December 1987 as the Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) under the auspices of the Australian Computer Society (ACS) at the University of Melbourne. In the mid-1990s, CIAC changed its name to AusCERT and moved its headquarters to the Department of Communications in Canberra. Since then, it has moved to the AGIMO building in Belconnen, ACT. In January 2013, AusCERT relocated to the City of Melbourne.\n\nAusCERT is a specialist organisation that provides advice and assistance in computer security incidents to its constituent members. As an operational unit, AusCERT:\n\n\nAusCERT's incident management process incorporates the Australian Signals Directorate's Incident Handling Working Model, an approved Australian Standard, AS 4801-2005.\n\nAusCERT is the designated lead agency for computer security incidents within Australia's Critical Infrastructure community, as defined by the Communications and the Arts portfolio of the Commonwealth Government.\n\nSince 2001, AusCERT has been responsible for issuing national warnings and alerts on a number of security issues, as directed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).\n\n\nAusCERT is active in a number of national and international computer security forums. AusCERT regularly participates in the Cyber Storm exercises conducted by the US Department of Homeland Security, as well as the Cyber Storm exercises hosted by the Singapore Infocomm Development Authority. AusCERT has also participated in the Cyber Security Exercise Series (CSES) developed by the Government of New Zealand. In 2003, AusCERT attended the UK's National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC) / British Computer Emergency Response Team (BCERT) course, and was the first international agency to receive the NISCC's Advanced Incident Handling course.\n\nOn 8 September 2005, AusCERT signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Homeland Security's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to formalise cooperation in the areas of:\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Dick Carr\n\nDick Carr (born March 23, 1941) is a former American football player and coach.

On July 18, 2005, Ahmed Harkat was arrested under a Security Certificate by the Government of Canada, at his home in Ottawa, on the grounds that he was involved in terrorist activities, in particular in association with the al-Qaeda organization. On November 23, 2005, Ahmed Harkat was detained indefinitely by the Federal Court. He was released on strict house arrest conditions on February 1, 2006, after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that his detention was unconstitutional. On December 13, 2007, the Court of Appeal for Ontario found that Harkat was detained lawfully. However, the Court ordered a new detention review hearing to be held before the end of June 2008. The Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear his appeal on February 15, 2008.\n\nHarkat applied for a judicial review of the decision of the Minister of Public Safety to order his detention. The Federal Court of Canada dismissed his application on December 14, 2006. Harkat has appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Federal Court decision came a week after the United States Senate rejected a bill to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nIn August 2008, Harkat was living under 24-hour house arrest, with some restrictions.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the security certificate under which Harkat was detained was valid and that he must be deported.\n\nOn July 29, 2015, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld a lower court decision and ruled that Harkat could stay in Canada. The ruling meant that Harkat could not be removed from Canada and remained under a strict form of house arrest.\n\nOn January 12, 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear his appeal.\n\nAhmed Harkat was born in Pakistan in 1971, and he came to Canada in 1995. He speaks some English and has a wife and three daughters. He is a pizza delivery driver in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nHarkat worked in Peshawar, Pakistan as a relief coordinator for Care International Pakistan, an international humanitarian organization, until 1999. He then went on to work as an accountant and cashier at Afghan Relief in Peshawar, a project of the National Council for Voluntary Social Services (NCVSS).\n\nHarkat came to the attention of Canadian intelligence officials after being deported from Dubai in April 2000, after he failed to obtain a visa for the United States. He has never visited Afghanistan, a key requirement of a security certificate. Harkat also states that he was not involved in any terrorist activity, and has never supported or associated with a terrorist organization.\n\nHarkat was arrested on December 10, 2002. He was charged with knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity and knowingly participating in the activities of a terrorist group.\n\nOn January 23, 2003, a judge granted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an order to monitor his activities and to search his home. On March 20, 2003, Harkat was released under a strict curfew. The surveillance and house arrest was lifted on September 11, 2003.\n\nOn February 10, 2004, the judge in the case ruled that Harkat would not be allowed to work as a relief coordinator in his community or to interact with a list of specified persons, including the media. On March 10, 2004, Harkat's curfew was changed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., and the list of people he was not allowed to contact was expanded to include more than 100 people, including several Members of Parliament.\n\nOn May 11, 2004, the judge in the case ruled that Harkat would not be allowed to attend community events, and that he would be required to meet regularly with RCMP officials.\n\nOn August 16, 2004, Harkat was accused of writing love letters to two married women, one of whom was an RCMP officer.\n\nOn September 15, 2004, the Attorney General of Canada, under Paul Martin, asked that Harkat be detained for an additional six months, which was approved by a judge on October 12.\n\nOn September 30, 2004, Harkat's wife, Sophie, appeared on a news show, the \"National Magazine\" on CBC.\n\nOn January 21, 2005, the Federal Court of Canada ordered Harkat to remain under a 24-hour surveillance and under house arrest. On January 23, 2005, he was required to surrender his passport.\n\nOn May 1, 2005, a Canada-wide arrest warrant was issued by the FBI for Hark"

In addition, you'll gain Overcharge stacks while attacking enemy champions and playing as Summoner's Rift objectives. The more you participate, the faster you charge!\n\nWith the PROJECT pre-season approaching, we're giving Overcharge a test run on the PBE!\n\nHow do I get Overcharge?\n\nYour team starts with a fixed number of Overcharge tokens that reset when you recall. You earn more Overcharge by killing enemy champions and playing as objectives.\n\nObjective Total tokens Rift Herald 2 Scuttle Crab 2.5 Dragon 4\n\nKilling an enemy champion generates 1 stack, but if you earn more than 5 stacks, you'll go into \"overdrive\" and get a short burst of additional movement speed and attack speed!\n\n1-5 stacks: +8% AS / 10% MS\n\n6-10 stacks: +16% AS / 20% MS\n\n11+ stacks: +24% AS / 30% MS\n\nOverdrive lasts 1.5 seconds and grants up to +120% bonus AS and +180% bonus MS!\n\nOverdrive ends immediately if you're dealt damage greater than 4% of your maximum health or if you activate Stormguard Banner.\n\nPROJECT: Hunters\n\nPROJECT: Hunters rewards map objectives and creating map pressure for your team.

However, Exhaust should feel more effective against high attack speed targets because its slow should be more powerful.\n\nWe're doing this by reducing the duration of the slow by 10% but increasing the duration of the debuff that prevents the target from autoattacking by the same amount. Overall, this means that it'll be easier to reach the minimum Attack Speed slow but harder to reach the maximum Attack Speed slow.\n\nAlso, this means Exhaust won't affect attack speed-based champs as much because it'll take more time for the debuff to tick down.\n\nWe'll continue to assess Exhaust and other individual adjustments to hit our goals in the pre-season.<|endoftext|>Unemployed people who refuse a job offer will have their benefits cut under Government plans.\n\nThe Government will tighten the conditions which allow unemployed people to refuse work offers.\n\nWork and Income (WINZ) has been told it must provide greater support for people to get into work.\n\nBeneficiaries who refuse a suitable job offer will have their benefits reduced under new measures announced by Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Government plans crackdown on parents who won't work\n\n* PM takes aim at beneficiaries who refuse to work\n\n* Thousands of solo parents' benefit slashed under 'tough love' plan\n\n* More sanctions on beneficiaries as Government claims welfare reforms are working\n\n* Benefit sanctions have forced hundreds to quit job search\n\n* Beneficiaries told 'get a job' in get tough letter\n\n* Benefit sanctions 'designed to make you feel like you're doing something wrong'\n\n* No Job? No Benefit.\n\nThere will be exceptions for those who cannot work due to illness or disability, and those in serious financial hardship.\n\nThose who had been receiving a sickness or invalids benefit, such as the invalids benefit, the sickness benefit, or the severe disabilities benefit for at least six months in the past two years, will be exempt from the tougher requirements.\n\nHowever, all job seekers who had been on a sickness benefit for six months or more would be required to actively look for a job, even if they were on a sickness benefit.\n\nThe measures, contained in a Ministry of Social Development discussion paper, would apply to new and existing beneficiaries.\n\nThey would also apply to beneficiaries who are looking after a child under six months old, or a child who is in the \"prescribed age range\" of six to 12 months, or is aged under two years old.\n\nPeople with children over two years old would be expected to look for work once the youngest child turned two.\n\nBennett said jobseekers needed to be active and look for work, rather than wait to be told what to do.\n\n\"We don't think the system is working very well at the moment. The policy is asking for more people to go into paid employment.\"\n\nThe Government is under pressure to get more people into work, particularly with a labour shortage.\n\nJob vacancies were at a 10-year high, but there were not enough skilled workers to fill them, Work and Income chief executive Glenys Coughlan said.\n\nThere were also not enough job offers to meet the needs of unemployed people, Bennett said.\n\n\"We know there are around 28,000 job seekers who have been unemployed for a year or more, and nearly 30,000 unemployed who have been unemployed for at least two years,\" Bennett said.\n\n\"We want to get these people into the workforce.\"\n\nThe Government's target is for 55 per cent of people aged between 18 and 64 to be in paid work by the end of this year.\n\n\"This is a national problem. It's going to require a lot of hard work from all of us to solve it.\"\n\nThe discussion document is out for public consultation, and the measures are likely to be introduced in September.\n\nIf the measures are adopted, there will be increased reporting requirements, and consequences for not meeting work obligations.\n\nThere will be four levels of compliance measures.\n\n\"Where a person is placed at the highest level of compliance with their obligations, it would mean that a person may be subject to reduced or no benefit payments if they are not meeting their obligations,\" the discussion paper said.\n\nPeople on a benefit would be expected to have regular interviews with a case manager, and have mandatory obligations to get training and development.\n\n\"The expectation is that the person will be actively looking for work, and not sitting on the benefit,\" Bennett said.\n\n\"They can say no to jobs, but they will still need to look.\"\n\nThose who refused a job offer three times would be placed on the work preparation programme. They would be expected to actively look for work, and attend job interviews, if they were suitable for the position.\n\nIf the person did not have a suitable job offer, they would be expected to participate in the work preparation programme.\n\nThose on a benefit who refused to participate in the programme would have their benefit reduced.\n\nWork and Income would also actively seek out job opportunities, and encourage beneficiaries to apply for the jobs.\n\nBennett said the work preparation programme would not be mandatory.\n\nBut \"if you have two years of not being in work, you should probably have a little bit of pressure on you to do a little bit more\".\n\n\"I wouldn't want to see a situation where there was lots of sanctions. I think there will be exceptions.\"\n\nThe work programme already had a requirement for those who were work-ready to actively seek out work.\n\nThe changes were \"very targeted\", she said.\n\n\"If you've been on a benefit for a long time, we want to make sure you are taking steps to get into work.\n\n\"It's about saying to people 'get with it or we'll move you along'.\"\n\nThe tighter requirements for beneficiaries were part of a wider review of the welfare system.\n\nThe changes could see beneficiaries' obligations reduced if they were taking care of a seriously ill or dying family member.\n\nBut if the sickness was self-inflicted, such as drug and alcohol abuse, there could be tougher requirements.\n\nCoughlan said there was already a work-ready requirement for job seekers, but that it was flexible.\n\n\"I think we're not as prescriptive as Australia. I think they're much more prescriptive.\"\n\nShe said it was important to keep the labour market up to date.\n\n\"That's part of our focus, to make sure that we've got the market that matches up with the right skills.\"\n\nThere had already been a move towards a more results-based approach, she said.\n\n\"We're already in the business of 'what are the outcomes for the people we serve'?\"\n\nThe discussion document said the proposed measures would help reduce the number of beneficiaries, while supporting those who were genuinely unable to work.\n\n\"It is proposed that these policy changes will provide a tighter fit between the requirements for beneficiaries to engage in paid work, and the exceptions to those requirements,\" it said.\n\nThe new measures are part of the Government's welfare reforms.\n\n\"There is a real concern that people are falling out of the benefit system.

"Filth was first made into a play for the BBC’s series of television plays in 2003, featuring Ewan McGregor, as a detective called Bruce Robertson. I don’t think it’s too far fetched to say that Bruce is the Scottish version of Neil Buchanan in American Psycho. Not necessarily in terms of the content of the story, but in the sheer fact that he is a very messed up guy, one who people can’t stand, but at the same time can’t stop looking at him.\n\nThis character is played to perfection by Jonny Lee Miller in the new film adaptation of Filth. The novel follows Bruce Robertson (Miller) a detective who, after starting the story off as a drunken, bitter asshole, finds out that he has cancer and so takes leave to get himself checked out. This action in turn leads to Bruce discovering that he is actually a massive pervert. He becomes obsessed with performing the most unspeakable of actions in order to be like the perverts that he so despises. The film follows Bruce as he conducts an investigation to find the person responsible for him being a terrible person and while he is still struggling with his illness.\n\nWhat is great about this adaptation is that it keeps the nastiness and the gritty, unpleasant content that is in the book. That might be what stops this film from being a complete success because this film is a difficult watch. It’s not so difficult because of the content but because you will be so incredibly frustrated by the main character. He is an unpleasant person who you don’t want to spend time with.\n\nIt’s a testament to Miller’s performance that he makes you want to keep watching even though you can’t stand him. It’s this nastiness that he exudes that makes him so engaging to watch. You will want to know how his investigation turns out and what his next move is, because he is truly awful. It also helps that he looks incredibly creepy, like he would kill someone at the slightest provocation.\n\nBruce is helped by a fantastic supporting cast. Jon Skellern plays Bruce’s best friend Simon. You can tell that Simon has his concerns for Bruce and that his concern for him will only continue to grow as Bruce’s behaviour becomes worse. Simon acts as the voice of reason when it comes to Bruce and does his best to help him, only to be shut down by Bruce’s barbs and by Bruce himself. Kelly Macdonald plays Bruce’s wife Susan. While Bruce gets into scrapes with his fellow detectives, Susan is struggling to cope with him and his illness. It’s obvious that Susan is struggling with her husband’s condition, and you will feel for her throughout the film.\n\nThere are a lot of big names in this film that will be recognisable to most people. Jonny Lee Miller, so good as Sherlock Holmes, plays Bruce with a brilliant blend of ferocity and uncertainty. While he is fully committed to the disgusting nature of his character, he also seems like he could completely lose it at any minute. Stephen Fry is outstanding as Inspector Siobhan Clarke, who is one of the few people who is able to make Bruce think twice about the things he does. Everyone is perfectly cast and help to make this film feel incredibly authentic.\n\nThe film does do a good job of adapting the book. Although the source material is sometimes over the top, the film takes that feeling and amplifies it to the next level. What is great about this film is that you do believe that all the characters are real people. You get a real sense of the community that Bruce has around him and that is what helps to make the film so engaging. You want to know what is going to happen to Bruce and how he is going to get out of the situations that he has put himself into.\n\nFilth is a good adaptation of the novel by Irvine Welsh. It does have the same nastiness that is in the novel, which is great for those of you who enjoy watching people doing things that you shouldn’t be watching. The acting is excellent, with a standout performance from Jonny Lee Miller, who takes the idea of a horrible person to a whole new level. It’s not the most pleasant of films to watch, but it’s certainly one of the most engaging.<|endoftext|>This board was created for the discussions of Nintendo's two major flagship gaming systems, the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo Wii.

His Betz Family Foundation has donated over $5 million to various organizations and projects, including Duluth's Discovery Center and the Betz Sportsman's Club, which has operated since 1948.\n\n\"It has been a real honor to know Bernie, work with him, and to benefit from his support,\" says John Stowe, president and CEO of the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center (DECC).\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Betz shared a quote from Henry Ford: \"If you think you can do a thing, or if you think you can't do a thing, you're right.\" Betz says he tries to follow this philosophy in all aspects of his life.\n\nBetz said that there are too many good people in Duluth to name one \"Great Duluthian,\" but he humbly accepted the award. \"This is just a thank you,\" Betz said. \"I thank you for this.\"<|endoftext|>Beauty\n\nI came across this article in Style Magazine about Kim Kardashian being named a rising star by Teen Vogue. Really?! Kim Kardashian is being compared to Audrey Hepburn, and Grace Kelly?

What kind of beauty standards does Teen Vogue endorse?<|endoftext|>This is the first time I’ve made this recipe and I absolutely loved it! It is now one of my favorites. It had a lot of flavor and the ginger and garlic added great zing. I used 1 tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp of garlic. This was great served over brown rice. My husband raved about this meal. Thanks for a great recipe!\n\nI have made this for years but never reviewed it. The longer it sits the better it tastes. I do make it on a regular basis. I often do half coconut milk and half veggie broth. One of my family's favorite meals. I am thinking of using the coconut milk and broth when I cook it instead of water and bullion cube.<|endoftext|>Le lancement de Canon EOS M5 est imminent et pour ce faire, la société nippone lance sur les réseaux sociaux une campagne marketing axée autour de la qualité des vidéos. Un teaser se promène donc sur la toile d’après laquelle le boîtier serait capable de filmer dans une résolution 4K (passe de 2,7K).\n\nLes qualités vidéo d’un boîtier déterminées par la résolution de l’enregistrement de la vidéo. La baisse de la résolution ne signifie pas pour autant que la qualité diminue : on peut avoir une résolution 4K pour une vidéo en HD, ou inversement.\n\nEt de toute évidence, la résolution 4K de la vidéo de Canon EOS M5 semble plus qu’une simple rumeur. Et c’est un scoop ? Pas vraiment puisque le constructeur avait annoncé que son prochain compact avait la capacité de filmer en 4K il y a un an. Et pour une raison qui n’est pas claire, la marque nippone a tout simplement gardé ce secret.\n\nUne résolution 4K a de quoi attirer les foules, et surtout les utilisateurs d’appareils photo. En effet, la 4K constitue aujourd’hui un format de référence, à l’instar de la résolution Full HD. Cela dit, la 4K n’est pas forcément un avantage pour un boîtier de ce type, mais plutôt pour les boîtiers d’entrée de gamme ou de milieu de gamme.\n\nCanon EOS M5 : plusieurs versions ?\n\nLa résolution 4K, comme l’explique Dpreview, est un atout dans le cas des fabricants de boîtiers car ceux-ci peuvent dès lors proposer des machines à un prix bas et vendre ensuite des objectifs (propres à l’appareil ou non) à prix plus élevé.\n\nCanon EOS M5 a beau être attendu au tournant, il ne faudra toutefois pas s’attendre à ce que l’appareil soit doté d’une stabilisation des images. Le boîtier ne semble en effet pas disposer d’une stabilisation optique d’image, alors que la concurrence (compacts compris) possède désormais un système de stabilisation optique.<|endoftext|>// Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be\n\n// Check if the field is initialized or not\n\n// Determine the kind of path to use\n\n// Generate the path from the module name, directory and field name.\n\n// Module name comes first, to keep a consistant ordering between native\n\n// native method code and java/native method code, to allow for more readable\n\n// Remove 'this' parameter from the function declaration\n\n// If the arguments are references (ie. the passed in argument is a local\n\n// variable), mark the parameter as read only.\n\n// If there is a non-factory constructor, use it\n\n// Always use the default constructor\n\n// A non-null `type` value, or `value` with a type annotation,\n\n// means that we are constructing a type.\n\n// Use the native constructor if it exists, otherwise fall back to\n\n// Use the name of the class as the default constructor name.\n\n// Check if a constructor exists on the type\n\n// If the value is a reference, use the name of the field.\n\n// Use the default constructor name for a value.\n\n// If the value is a reference, use the name of the field.\n\n// If a type is specified (name or value), it takes precedence.\n\n// If we have a type annotation on the parameter, it must match the type\n\n// If we have a name annotation on the parameter, it must match the name\n\n// Use the name of the class as the constructor name\n\n// If we have a type annotation on the parameter, it must match the type\n\n// If we have a name annotation on the parameter, it must match the name\n\n// Don't check for annotation matches in constructors.\n\n// Try to use the field name as a constructor name\n\n// If there is a non-factory method, use it\n\n// Always use the default constructor\n\n// A non-null `type` value, or `value` with a type annotation,\n\n// means that we are constructing a type.\n\n// Use the native constructor if it exists, otherwise fall back to\n\n// Use the name of the class as the default constructor name.\n\n// Check if a constructor exists on the type\n\n// If the value is a reference, use the name of the field.\n\n// Use the default constructor name for a value.\n\n// If the value is a reference, use the name of the field.\n\n// If a type is specified (name or value), it takes precedence.\n\n// If we have a type annotation on the parameter, it must match the type\n\n// If we have a name annotation on the parameter, it must match the name\n\n// Use the name of the class as the constructor name\n\n// If we have a type annotation on the parameter, it must match the type\n\n// If we have a name annotation on the parameter, it must match the name\n\n// Don't check for annotation matches in constructors.\n\n// Try to use the field name as a constructor name\n\n// If there is a non-factory method, use it\n\n// Always use the default constructor\n\n// A non-null `type` value, or `value` with a type annotation,\n\n// means that we are constructing a type.\n\n// Use the native constructor if it exists, otherwise fall back to\n\n// Use the name of the class as the default constructor name.\n\n// Check if a constructor exists on the type\n\n// If the value is a reference, use the name of the field.\n\n// Use the default constructor name for a value.\n\n// If the value is a reference, use the name of the field.\n\n// If a type is specified (name or value), it takes precedence.\n\n// If we have a type annotation on the parameter, it must match the type\n\n// If we have a name annotation on the parameter, it must match the name\n\n// Use the name of the class as the constructor name\n\n// If we have a type annotation on the"
"Why won't anyone on the Senate Banking Committee acknowledge that debt restructuring is needed for the Puerto Rico debt crisis to be solved? I just spent about two hours on CSPAN watching the Committee's hearings about Puerto Rico. Not once was the possibility of debt restructuring, which would mean debt reduction, mentioned. All that was mentioned was higher taxes, pension cuts, and deep government spending cuts, on top of what Puerto Rico is already doing. A complete deadlock. Puerto Rico has been austerity-impaired for a long time now, and has experienced a 12% drop in GDP as a result. No one can grow their way out of debt. Yet, even with this depression-like economy, Puerto Rico is still paying a huge amount of its income to its creditors. A lot of that debt comes from bonds that the government of Puerto Rico sold to investors to get the money to cover the huge losses that its electricity monopoly incurred because of oil price spikes. The government still has no way to fix that, since electricity is now being generated by private companies, due to a privatization law passed in 2013. The government of Puerto Rico could offer a debt exchange to investors, swapping the current bonds for ones with a longer maturity date and a lower interest rate, and then reinvest the proceeds into infrastructure projects, where it has a big deficit. But that possibility is completely ruled out. On the other side, the creditors are as intransigent as ever. They claim they can sue the US government if it tries to change their contracts, which is not true. They also claim that Puerto Rico is defaulting on its debt already, which is also not true. The government of Puerto Rico has been paying its creditors 100 cents on the dollar. There is simply no default risk. This is all a huge waste of time. All that the Puerto Rico hearings did was show that the US Congress is not capable of doing what it should have done long ago: allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debts. That would have given Puerto Rico a fresh start, and the creditors would have ended up with their money back. And we would have avoided all this useless talking. Now, we are just wasting time and making the situation worse. Puerto Rico's economy continues to decline. Puerto Rico's economy is expected to contract again by at least 1% in 2016, and another 2% in 2017. Most of the business owners I interviewed in Puerto Rico last month said they expect business to get worse in 2017. So the longer the creditors keep Puerto Rico in this situation, the worse it will get. In the hearings today, several senators brought up a resolution that the House of Representatives passed yesterday in a partisan vote, saying that Puerto Rico is already in default. That resolution is just to make a political point. The Supreme Court has already ruled that Puerto Rico cannot declare bankruptcy like a US municipality can, and cannot restructure its debt in a court. This was because of a law that was passed in 1984. The US Congress could have changed this law a long time ago, but they did not. The Republicans in the House of Representatives, however, do not want to restructure Puerto Rico's debts. Instead, they are trying to force the government of Puerto Rico to do all the reforms it already is doing, without giving it the opportunity to do the debt restructuring that will put its economy back on track. This was not really mentioned in the Senate hearings, but I found out from reporters that the Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee are not going to move forward with the House resolution. They understand that it is not going to pass. We need Congress to pass the resolution anyway, just to show that it has bipartisan support. In the House hearings, Representative Sean Duffy of Wisconsin said, \"This is not an emergency.\" This is a statement that no one in Puerto Rico agrees with. By delaying the debt restructuring, the economy of Puerto Rico is getting worse. More people are moving to the US mainland, which will further reduce the income that Puerto Rico is able to collect in taxes. More people are being forced to do cash jobs in the underground economy, because they cannot find other jobs. And those jobs do not get reported to the government. The longer this process is delayed, the worse it will get. But the creditors and some members of Congress do not seem to understand that Puerto Rico needs a fresh start. So they will continue to waste time, talking about things that are already being done, without any hope of any positive outcome. Puerto Rico's creditors just don't want to take a loss. But we are not doing Puerto Rico any favors by letting this situation continue for so long.<|endoftext|>A 21-year-old man died early Tuesday morning after being struck by a car while riding his bike in Logan Square, police said.\n\nAt 1:26 a.m., authorities responded to the intersection of Fullerton and Armitage avenues where the bicyclist was hit by a car, according to Chicago Police.

I've been a fan of \"American Chopper\" since day one. I used to get angry with Paul Sr. for the way he treated the guys but I guess that was part of the show's draw. I have never seen a father and son fight like that on TV before. I still hope he comes back someday to work with his son, and they can rebuild the relationship they had before. I can't say enough good things about this season of American Chopper, with all the good work the team did for cancer patients, this is one of the most memorable seasons of the series.\n\nThe creativity of the builds is incredible. I'm so glad that they were able to get the Ford back on the road after the fire. They did an amazing job on the bike itself and the amount of work they put into making sure everything was functional on the bike, even the brakes, was inspiring. The customization they did on the ambulance was pretty impressive as well, especially how they made sure all the hydraulic and electrical components worked correctly. I also loved the idea of doing a bike with a hunting theme and the amount of work they put into making the motorcycles look like they belonged to an entire hunting party was great. They did an amazing job on the bike that played homage to the military and even the Great American motorcycle show was awesome! The barber shop bike and \"Appalachian Outlaw\" motorcycle were just as awesome. The personal touches that were put on these bikes really made them so much better.\n\nI know a lot of people criticize the shows for not showing the whole building process, but in my opinion, I like to see the creativity that the builders put into the bikes.

It is not an uncommon story in that many physicians cannot get paid by insurance companies for a variety of reasons. The difference in this story is that this physician not only tried to get paid, but took the insurance company to court to try to get paid.\n\nIt started when a physician sent an invoice to an insurance company for services rendered. The physician was told that the insurance company did not have the funds to pay the invoice and that they would pay the bill at a later date. The physician sent the insurance company a bill every month for about a year until the insurance company stopped communicating. The physician was then advised by a collection agency that if he wanted to be paid, he would have to take the insurance company to court.\n\nThe physician then did just that. He filed a claim with the District Court seeking the unpaid bill plus interest and costs. The insurance company tried to have the case dismissed by claiming the physician did not have standing to sue. The insurance company argued that the physician only had a contractual right to be paid, but that right had not been breached. They also argued that he could not have been damaged by their failure to pay since it was their money.\n\nThe physician won the case. He was awarded the $10,600 plus interest and costs. The judge agreed that the insurance company breached the contract when it failed to pay the bill. The judge also found that the insurance company's withholding of payment did cause the physician to suffer damages in the form of legal fees to pursue payment.\n\nAs for the insurance company, it is probably a good idea that they got caught. Since their contract was breached and they caused damages, they may be liable for punitive damages which could double the amount of the doctor's claim.<|endoftext|>Forgive me if this has been answered already.\n\n\n\nI bought a standard prepaid plan and activated it last week.

"The US Forest Service has announced that the Fern Lake Fire is fully contained and the evacuation advisory for North of Tofte has been lifted. This comes after firefighters spent the last week building up the fire lines around the blaze. It also means that Minnesota State Highway 61 is now open to traffic again, as are Highway 1 and Highway 61 (Forest Roads 18 and 55), which run through the fire area.\n\nAs of Monday morning, there are still seven aircraft and 380 firefighters assigned to the fire, which was estimated to be 70 percent contained. It has burned 6,900 acres and its cause remains under investigation.\n\nThe next update is expected by Friday morning.<|endoftext|>In my world it's important to be organized. Especially when you live with more than two people, which I do. Most of the time, everything is on a schedule. No one is allowed to eat at 11pm unless they're hungry. Everyone is not allowed to leave dirty dishes in the sink unless they're at work. If you're working out at a certain time, you have to shower. No one can go outside unless it's to throw out the garbage. And so on and so forth.\n\nFor some reason, though, the whole \"organization\" idea flies right out the window when I'm trying to schedule a trip. I tend to plan things to the day and then get annoyed if something goes wrong or someone else wants to do something that may interfere. I hate it when someone wants to do something at a time that I've already booked for another thing. I feel like I should have priority, especially since I've planned this whole thing and if it were cancelled, I would have to pay for everything anyway.\n\nBut, guess what? I've realized I'm wrong. I've realized that while I may have planned the whole thing, other people need to be included too. And that they deserve a say in what goes on too. Maybe that means they have to drive back a different route to get home or they need to leave an hour earlier to get to their house. Maybe they need to stay later than they would have planned. Or maybe they don't want to leave. And that's ok. It doesn't have to ruin anything.\n\nAs long as everyone is included and has a say, it's all good. It doesn't mean that there won't be stress involved. There will be. I'm not going to lie. We may end up fighting about some things. Or they might leave early, which makes us upset. But at the end of the day, we're still family. We still love each other. We still get to have fun.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that sometimes, I need to let other people in. To let them have a say in what happens. Otherwise, it will just be me against them. And I'd rather be the bigger person. I'd rather be the one who says \"Fine, I'll do it this way\" instead of the one who gets in an argument. I don't want to be the one who stays up late crying over something that went wrong and couldn't be avoided.\n\nSo, to sum up my whole blog:<|endoftext|>\"Would You Accept A Ridiculously Generous Gift?\n\nThe book, Cults Inside Out, claims to reveal everything you ever wanted to know about cults, from recruiting and controlling techniques to the manipulation of the children of cult members. The book is written by Jeremy Spencer, who claims that his grandfather was a cult leader and that his father was in a cult. It is hoped that by publishing this book that Jeremy Spencer can stop this cycle and prevent any other children from being hurt in this way.\n\nA spokesperson for Jeremy Spencer has confirmed that he is desperately in need of some cash to fund the marketing and promotion of the book. The cost is simply too great to risk doing it alone. He hopes that if he can raise enough money to pay for advertising, then he will be able to share his story and help people.\n\nIf Jeremy Spencer can raise enough money for the book, then he will gift it to the person who donates the most money. The donation can be made via the crowdfunding site Kickstarter.com.\n\nDonating to this crowdfunding campaign is likely to have more benefits than simply receiving a copy of the book. You can be part of the book and even get a speaking part in it. This is a great opportunity to help someone with a great story.\"\n\nKickstarter is a crowdfunding website that allows you to donate money to people who are trying to raise money for something. In return for your donations, you can receive gifts from the person you are donating to.\n\nWould You Accept A Ridiculously Generous Gift?\n\nA friend of mine contacted me a few months ago to ask if I would consider reviewing a book for them. The book was called Cults Inside Out and the author is called Jeremy Spencer. He has offered to donate the book to the highest bidder.\n\nCults Inside Out is the first of a trilogy and Jeremy Spencer is trying to raise money to self-publish the second book. As part of his plan, Jeremy is offering to donate the book to the highest bidder. The highest bidder is whoever donates the most money to Jeremy's GoFundMe account.\n\nWould you accept a ridiculously generous gift? I decided that I would.\n\nJeremy Spencer is an interesting character. I had never heard of him before and I was sceptical about some of the things that he had to say. Jeremy is a bit of a controversial character and he is no stranger to the press. He is very controversial and he has a history of being sued for libel, but you can find out more about that on his GoFundMe page.\n\nThe book is about cults and how they use manipulation techniques to recruit people into their organisations. The book also talks about the psychology of the cult members and how they get manipulated. There is some fascinating stuff in there and it is an easy read.\n\nThe book starts with the stories of two children who were born into cults. One child was the son of a cult leader and the other child was the daughter of another cult leader. Both children were exposed to extreme forms of cult abuse and you can really feel the pain that they went through.\n\nI didn't really enjoy reading the stories of the two children because it was so sad. You could really feel their pain. I am glad that Jeremy was able to escape the cult, but I don't think that it is an easy thing to do. There are always going to be repercussions, no matter how many years later.\n\nAfter the stories of the two children, Jeremy goes on to talk about the psychology of the cult members. I didn't realise that there were so many different reasons why people join cults. There are a number of factors that can influence the decision to join a cult.\n\nThere are a number of strategies that cults use to recruit new members and Jeremy goes on to discuss the techniques that they use. He talks about how they use manipulation and persuasion techniques to encourage people to join them. Jeremy is not the first person to talk about these strategies, but he does explain them in a very clear way.\n\nJeremy also talks about the different kinds of cults and what they are like. There are religious cults and political cults and there are even business cults. There are all kinds of cults and it is fascinating to read about how they are structured and what they are all about.\n\nJeremy Spencer has also included information about his family and his time in the cult. I have never been in a cult, so I don't know what it is like, but I was impressed with how well Jeremy handled the subject. He didn't talk about the cult in a negative way and he didn't try to make it sound worse than it was.\n\nThere is a lot of information about cults in this book and Jeremy doesn't try to overstate any of the facts. He doesn't try to talk in hyperbole and he gives very factual descriptions of what it is like to be in a cult.\n\nIf you are a fan of cults, then this book is going to be right up your street. If you are just interested in psychology, then this book is also going to be right up your street. There are a lot of interesting theories and a lot of fascinating facts.\n\nThere are a number of interesting stories and you can really feel the emotion in this book. I am glad that I have read it, but I don't think that I will read the rest of the trilogy.\n\nWhat you will get if you make the highest bid\n\nIf you make the highest bid on Jeremy's GoFundMe page, then he will send you a copy of Cults Inside Out. The money that you donate will be used to help with the marketing and promotion of the book.\n\nI have seen people donate large amounts of money to crowdfunding projects, so it is definitely possible. Jeremy is even offering to sign your copy of the book, if you make the highest bid.\n\nThe book is available in paperback and as an e-book. You will also be able to get it in various different languages. It is likely to be available in a number of different countries.\n\nYou can get a signed copy of the book for just $30 and Jeremy has been very generous with his offers. There are some very generous rewards if you can make the highest bid. Jeremy is determined to get this book out and he will give you the opportunity to help him.\n\nIf you are interested in making the highest bid, then click here.

"'I'd only ever been with two girls'\n\nMany guys worry about their first time having sex – especially when it comes to having sex for the first time with a girl. How can you be sure she's comfortable? And what should you do if she says no?\n\nHere's how to handle your first time.\n\nGetting ready for the first time\n\nEven though your first time might be really exciting, you need to remember that having sex for the first time can be really awkward.\n\nThis is especially true if you're nervous, so to make it easier for both of you, try to relax, and make sure you're both feeling comfortable and happy to do it. You don't want to be worrying about whether your partner's enjoying it.\n\nThe best way to do this is to talk about it before you get started. Find out what she expects, and what she doesn't. Try to find out how much she knows about sex. It might seem strange to talk about this, but it will make it easier for you both when you get down to it.\n\nYou can talk about contraception too. Both of you should know how you're going to stop pregnancy happening and what to do if it does.\n\nA lot of guys worry about getting their first time over with, but in fact, the longer you take, the more you'll enjoy it. Most girls feel more comfortable the longer it takes. If you try to rush things, you're more likely to make her feel uncomfortable and she might not enjoy it.\n\nWhat if you're with someone new?\n\nIf you're having sex with someone for the first time, you may be nervous. You're not sure what to expect.\n\nYou're likely to be worried that you won't know how to do it properly or that you'll be rubbish in bed. But the fact is, it doesn't matter how good you are. All that matters is that you both enjoy it and that you're safe.\n\nYour worries might make you want to rush things and this might make you less sensitive and not as gentle as you should be. This is especially true if you're with a virgin. She'll be more nervous than you, so make sure you take your time and that you both enjoy it.\n\nYou'll know if she's enjoying it if she shows signs of pleasure, like:\n\nmoaning\n\ngetting very wet (this is the most obvious one!)\n\nshe may make noises or say things to let you know she's enjoying it\n\nremember to look for these signs!\n\nFirst time with a girl: the sex\n\nSex for the first time can be really exciting.\n\nWhat if she says no?\n\nIf your first time involves having sex with a girl, there's a chance she might say no. That's normal. It's important to make sure she's happy to do it. It's your responsibility to make sure she's okay with it and you don't want to do anything that might hurt her or make her feel uncomfortable.\n\nEven if she says yes, she might change her mind when the time comes. This can be a little awkward, especially if you've been going out with her for a while and you've had sex before.\n\nIf this happens, try to deal with it like a man. If you want to take it further, tell her you really want to, but you won't if she's not up for it.\n\nIf she wants to stop, you should respect that. It can happen, even if she's wanted to have sex for a while. If you think she might be pregnant, make sure you take care of that too.\n\nThe actual sex\n\nIt's important that you know how to please a girl, but this is especially important the first time. It will help you build your confidence, and it will also help her enjoy sex more.\n\nHow do you please a girl?\n\nWhat most people think about when it comes to pleasing a girl is what feels good for her. But in fact, what feels good for you is important too. It's the only way you can both enjoy yourselves and have a great time.\n\nBe careful to go slowly. If you go too fast, you might scare her or make her uncomfortable.\n\nWhat if you're not having sex with a virgin?\n\nIf you're not having sex with a virgin, it's unlikely that you'll have to worry about losing your virginity. It's more likely that she will lose hers!\n\nWhen you have sex for the first time, it's still important that you take it slow. It might be even more important because you'll need to show her that you can be gentle and caring. This will make sure she feels comfortable with you. It will also make sure that you have a great time too.\n\nIs she ready for sex?\n\nYou need to know when she's ready to have sex. If you rush it, you could end up doing something that she's not ready for. This could make her feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, which could make you feel embarrassed too.\n\nIf you don't think she's ready, you shouldn't go ahead. That's because it might make her feel like she's not good enough.\n\nJust be patient and make sure you're both happy and comfortable.\n\nYou can help her decide when she's ready for sex by asking her. Ask her what she thinks about having sex. If she says no, respect that, and don't push it.\n\nIf she says yes, talk about what you both think. Ask her if she's ready for it and talk about what you both expect. You'll both feel more relaxed if you know what's going to happen and you're both ready for it.\n\nDon't forget, it's important that you're both ready, not just her!\n\nWhat if you're with a virgin?\n\nSex for the first time can be really scary. But remember, you're both in the same boat and you can help each other through it.\n\nIf you're with a virgin, you need to remember that she's not an expert. It will take her a while to get used to sex and you need to give her time. It will help if you make sure you go slowly.\n\nAs you know, she'll be nervous, so you need to make sure she feels comfortable.\n\nSome girls are really confident and they're great at giving directions. But other girls aren't, so if she needs help, you should be there to help her.\n\nHow do you make sure she's ready?\n\nYou might have to talk about it. You might feel like she's pushing you into having sex, but she might not actually be ready for it.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable talking to her, you can find out by looking at her. Does she seem relaxed? Is she making the right noises? Is she happy? If she seems happy, you're probably okay.\n\nMake sure you ask her about contraception too. It's important to keep yourself safe, so make sure you both know how you're going to prevent pregnancy.\n\nWhat if you have problems?\n\nSex for the first time can be really scary for some guys. But the good news is that it doesn't have to be.\n\nWhat if you're having trouble getting an erection?\n\nIf you're having trouble getting an erection, it could be that you're nervous. It could also be that you don't feel ready for sex.\n\nIf it's nerves, you should try to relax. Try to take it slowly. You don't want to scare your partner. If you're not ready for sex, then you need to tell her.\n\nIt might help to talk to her about it first. If you think you're ready, but she isn't, you should respect that. You don't want to make her feel bad or make her regret having sex with you.\n\nIt's important that you're both ready for it and that you both feel comfortable. If you're not ready, don't go through with it.\n\nWhat if it doesn't feel right?\n\nSome guys worry about whether they're doing it right. It can be a bit scary if you don't know what to do.\n\nIt's really important that you talk about it. If you think it's not right, you should ask her.\n\nAnd don't worry too much. There's no right way to have sex. The important thing is that both of you are enjoying it and that you're both safe.\n\nIt's really important that you both make sure you're ready for sex. You don't want to go through with it if she's not ready.\n\nIf you're having sex with a virgin, then you need to be more careful. She might not know what she's doing, so it's important that you tell her what you want. You should also tell her if it doesn't feel right.\n\nWhat if it hurts?\n\nIf you're having sex for the first time, there's a chance that it could hurt. But the good news is that this should only happen the first time. If it happens again, you should get help as soon as possible.\n\nYour partner should tell you if it hurts, so you need to listen to her. You should also be able to tell if it hurts. If you can't, then it's not right.\n\nIf it hurts her, then you need to stop and think about what you're doing. It's important that you both know what feels good and what doesn't.\n\nIf you're not sure what to do, then it might be best to practice with a toy. You can use it to find out what she likes and what she doesn't.\n\n"
"Public Bookmark *\n\nJames “Bucky” Barnes was born in the dead of night, right at the edge of winter and the approaching storm. At least, that’s how his mother likes to tell it. Her mother, a woman who had been born with the gift of sight, had foretold that James would be born during a storm, that his destiny would be caught up in a whirlwind, that he would live a life surrounded by shadows. And in the shadow of the war, there were few people more surrounded by them.\n\nHe lived in the shadow of Steve Rogers and it was only in the wake of his death that James could finally step out from it, could step out of the shadows.\n\nIt is a slow process, this transition.

The effects of endogeneity of these explanatory variables on the standard error of the estimated structural coefficients are quantified. A large endogeneity bias, whose size is not affected by the lag length, is found for all sets of variables, except the set with a positive effect on the last observed outcome, which is relatively immune to endogeneity bias. These results are used to analyze the effects of unobserved variables on the estimates of the true effects and on the standard errors of the estimated effects of observed variables. The impact of unobserved variables on the estimates is sometimes substantial.<|endoftext|>Post by Liz » Fri Jan 03, 2018 10:08 am\n\nIt was a tough morning for the county road department this morning with all the road closures due to high water and downed trees.

It stars Ajay Devgn and Ayesha Takia in lead roles and Kunal Khemu, Nafisa Ali and Rajpal Yadav in supporting roles. The film is a remake of the American movie \"Unfaithful\".\n\nThis movie was an average grosser at the box office.\n\nA middle class girl, Meghna (Ayesha Takia) lives with her divorced mother, Dr. Kamla Tiwari (Reema Lagoo), a well known psychiatrist, and her younger sister in the suburbs of Mumbai. Her parents had divorced when she was just two years old, and she has hardly seen her father, Colonel Rameshwar Prasad (Deepak Shirke), ever since.\n\nRajeev Mathur (Ajay Devgn), a renowned architect, is married to Sheetal (Ayesha Julka), who is the love of Meghna's life. Meghna falls in love with Rajeev, and they become involved in an illicit relationship. One day, while trying to evade Rajeev, Meghna witnesses an incident where her father, whom she had not met for more than twelve years, is found dead at a friend's farmhouse.\n\nShe goes to his funeral and is completely shocked to see Rajeev there. On confronting him, she is told that he and her father were old friends and colleagues. She accepts this, but not before starting to suspect that Rajeev has been trying to get her out of the way in order to take over her father's position. She confronts Rajeev on this, but he insists that this is not the case.\n\nMeghna, unable to bear the thought that her father was killed, decides to investigate on her own. She tracks down one of the servants at the farmhouse, who reveals that her father was shot, and that Rajeev was there, drunk, when it happened. She confronts Rajeev, who admits that he and her father were involved in a fraud, in which they stole money from one of their clients, and faked his death to escape justice. However, Rajeev swears that he has nothing to do with her father's death.\n\nShe believes him, and accepts that she was wrong in suspecting him. While trying to console her, he kisses her. They decide to meet the next day. However, on the way to her meeting with Rajeev, she finds him being confronted by her mother and sister, who saw him leaving their house. Rajeev confesses to them that he and Meghna have been involved in a relationship, but insists that they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAfter much debate, her family decides to agree to the relationship. Rajeev insists that Meghna move in with them, but she is shocked to learn that she is pregnant with his child. She insists that Rajeev take a DNA test to prove that the child is his, and he does so.\n\nHe confesses to her that he was never married to his wife, and had no children. He had always been in love with Meghna, but had not told anyone about it, not even her father. Sheetal had left him for another man, who later divorced her, and Rajeev's father was killed by one of his clients, who then blackmailed him. He promises that they will run away together, but Meghna doesn't believe him.\n\nLater that night, Rajeev is killed, and Meghna is accused of the murder. Dr. Tiwari believes her daughter, and begins to suspect that Sheetal might be the murderer. The police refuse to believe Dr. Tiwari's story, and the family falls apart. Meghna is released, but her mother refuses to see her, and she is forced to live with her uncle and his family.\n\nWhen the child is born, the family is forced to admit that the child does bear a close resemblance to Rajeev. They forgive Meghna and re-accept her. She goes to Rajeev's mother (Nafisa Ali), and tells her that the child is Rajeev's. His mother is grief-stricken, but eventually decides to accept Meghna, and asks her to name the child, since Rajeev was also hers. Meghna decides to name the child after her father.\n\n\n\nAll songs were composed by Sandeep Chowta, written by Sameer, and performed by Udit Narayan and Kumar Sanu.\n\n<|endoftext|>Shawn Holmes\n\nShawn Holmes (born September 2, 1971) is an American former professional motocross racer.\n\nIn 1991, Holmes made the finals of the 250cc National Championship, finishing in 4th place.

From 1853 to 1860 he attended the Shamakhy religious school, and then later at the Shamakhi Muslim Boarding School. In 1862, he studied at the Nizamiyya Madrasah in Ganja. At first, he worked as a teacher, but then he moved to Tiflis where he studied at the Caucasian Muslim Gymnasium from 1864 to 1870. Then he returned to Shamakhi and taught at his old school until 1876, when he left for Tiflis again. In 1877, he moved to Baku and worked as a deputy editor and later as an editor at the \"Hayat\" newspaper. He lived in Tiflis for a third time from 1878 to 1884, and then returned to Baku, where he established a publishing house named \"Abdulgaffar\", which published the first Azerbaijani newspaper \"Bakinskiy Listok\". He died in 1889.\n\nRafibeyli is considered the founder of the Azerbaijani novel. He is also the author of numerous plays. His best-known plays include \"Mumtaz Khan\" (1882), \"Seyid Huseyn\" (1886), \"Arshin Mal Alan\" (1884), \"Khanlar Bahadur\" (1886), and \"Shirin\" (1887). His plays mainly revolve around the heroic deeds of people in the history of Azerbaijan, but his historical plays do not have a profound philosophical content. As well as plays, he also wrote novels and short stories such as \"Koroghlu\" (1872), \"Xirayi\" (1872), \"Jabal\" (1872), \"Dashtadem\" (1873), \"Shah Abbas and Kamaleddin Efendi\" (1879), \"Bahadur Khan Shaku\" (1880), \"Shah Mansur\" (1882), \"Shirin\" (1886), \"Sulthan Mahmud\" (1888), \"Dervish Khudadat\" (1886), \"Agha Mammad Hasan\" (1888), \"Qataghani\" (1889), \"Khurshidbanu Natavan\" (1889), \"Nebiy\" (1890), \"Unsulli\" (1890), and \"Gulbakhor\" (1890).\n\nHis two most famous works are \"Seyid Huseyn\" (1886) and \"Arshin Mal Alan\" (1884). \"Seyid Huseyn\" was written after the Karabakh liberation movement (1830-1835) and was first staged in 1873. It is a work of realism and it depicts the life of the Azerbaijani feudal landlord Seyid Huseyn. It was written in the tradition of oriental tales and was praised for its artistic value and the depiction of people. \"Arshin Mal Alan\" is a work of realist-idealistic nature. It tells about the greed of people and how this brings misfortune to them. This work was praised for the beauty of its language and for the pathos of its characters.\n\nIn addition to his plays and novels, Rafibeyli translated several plays by Russian playwrights into Azerbaijani.\n\nRaf"

Hier sind dementsprechend einige russische Technologien in den vergangenen Jahren installiert worden. Vor allem Stromerzeugung von Solarzellen hat sich für Kuba als erfolgreich erwiesen. In den vergangenen fünf Jahren wurden 2.000 Solarzellen in Kuba eingesetzt.\n\nDer Nutzen von Solarzellen für Kuba\n\nSolarenergie fördert auf Kuba gesundheitlich viele Vorteile. Erstens erzeugt sie Strom, was für einen Staat, der wie Kuba so viele wichtige Schritte in Sachen Energie für eine modernisierte Gesellschaft geht, eine große Rolle spielt. Die Energiegewinnung wird damit auch in Kuba demographisch ausgeglichen.\n\nZweitens löst die Sonnenenergie den direkten Nutzen für die medizinische Versorgung aus. Das bedeutet, dass Solarzellen auch für die Versorgung von medizinischem Gerät eingesetzt werden können, wodurch wiederum die Gesundheit der Menschen verbessert wird. So gesehen ist die Installation von Solarzellen eine entscheidende Sache, die für eine langfristige Gesundheit von Menschen gesorgt hat.\n\nWie werden Solarzellen produziert?\n\nAuch wenn das Wetter auf Kuba eine große Rolle spielt, kann man aufgrund der Klimaänderungen auf der Insel mit einem bedeutenden Einfluss auf die Anwendung von Solarenergie rechnen. Daher werden die Solarzellen auf Kuba in großem Umfang eingesetzt. Wie genau das im Einzelnen geschieht, zeigt das Beispiel des Leuchtturms „La Revolución“ in der Provinz Las Tunas. Dieser wurde mit Solarzellen gebaut, weil die vorhandene Infrastruktur einige Herausforderungen mit sich bringt. Die Installation der Solarzellen hat dementsprechend unmittelbare Erfolge mit sich gebracht.\n\nDer Leuchtturm befindet sich auf einer Klippe, die einen Abstand von 1.250 Metern zum Festland hat. Es gibt keine Möglichkeit, in den Turm ein Stromkabel einzuziehen. Das ist deshalb ein Problem, weil dieser Turm eine gewisse Größe hat. Die Möglichkeit, dass der Strom aus der Natur umweltfreundlich gewonnen werden kann, wird durch die Installation der Solarzellen genutzt. Wie es ebenfalls erwähnt wurde, befindet sich der Leuchtturm auf einer Klippe und somit auch einige Kilometer von der Siedlung entfernt. Deshalb ist es hier sehr lohnenswert, Solarzellen zu installieren.\n\nDie große Stromproduktion des Leuchtturms ist das Resultat des Einsatzes von Solarenergie. Der gesamte Energiebedarf wird damit gedeckt. Solarzellen haben sich dementsprechend als eine äußerst wertvolle Sache für Kuba erwiesen. Dadurch wird eine stromproduzierende Stelle sichergestellt, die unabhängig vom Regenwetter ist. Somit haben Solarzellen einen unglaublich hohen Nutzen für Kuba.\n\nFazit\n\nDie Installation von Solarzellen auf Kuba stellt somit einen sehr wichtigen Baustein für das Funktionieren der Gesellschaft dar. Die Produktion von Strom aus Sonnenenergie fördert die Gesundheit, da sie dem Bevölkerungswachstum Rechnung trägt. Solarzellen sind daher auch in Kuba eine wichtige Sache, um die Energieversorgung zu sichern.<|endoftext|>Cardiac intervention in men is a critical procedure performed with the best equipment available. Sometimes, however, there are complications that are difficult to solve. For example, the images provided by a coronary angiography may not be clear enough for the doctor to determine the problem. In this situation, it is necessary to perform an intervention for coronary angioplasty. This is a technique that was introduced in the 1970s and has been improved many times over the years.\n\nWhat is coronary angioplasty?\n\nCoronary angioplasty is a technique that allows the narrowing of a coronary artery to be dilated. This is done with the use of a catheter that has a flexible balloon at its end. This is inflated and deflated so that the artery is dilated. Once the dilation is achieved, a stent is implanted to keep the artery dilated and allow blood to flow properly. The stent is a small metal ring that is placed inside the lumen of the artery. It acts as a scaffold and prevents the vessel from closing. This is important because, if this happened, the part of the heart that receives blood from this artery would not receive any more.\n\nCoronary angioplasty is performed under general anesthesia. The patient is given nitroglycerin so that the pain caused by the dilation of the artery is less intense. Sometimes, if the patient has chest pain, an injection of painkillers may be needed.\n\nAfter the procedure is completed, the patient is observed to make sure he has not had any complications. If the patient develops a hematoma, the artery is usually clamped again and the hematoma is removed by inserting a small wire.\n\nThe risk of complications is low. They can develop in patients who have had angioplasty many times or who have had previous heart attacks.\n\nThe main advantage of angioplasty is that it provides immediate relief for the patient. If the stent works well, the patient may need to take medication for the rest of his life. This is an important advantage for those who have suffered a heart attack and are at risk of a second one.\n\nIn certain cases, it is necessary to repeat the intervention several times until the lumen of the artery becomes stable. Usually, the procedure is done after 4-6 weeks, depending on the patient’s progress.<|endoftext|>Olympic Champion Jazmin Carlin had a successful return to racing on the World Cup circuit this weekend, winning a silver medal in the 50m backstroke and claiming two more top-3 finishes in the 200m individual medley and 50m freestyle.\n\nCarlin, a Manchester born-and-bred athlete who moved to Wales to train with the Welsh Academy, produced a stunning performance in the 50m backstroke, finishing just over a second behind American world-record holder Kathleen Baker.\n\nA week earlier she had set a new British record of 26.06 seconds at the British Championships, setting up a superb start to the 2018 season.\n\nEarlier in the week, Carlin also clocked a lifetime best in the 200m individual medley in Glasgow. Her swim of 2:14.50 is her fastest ever 200m medley in a year that she is targeting selection for the European Championships.\n\n“I came into this season knowing that I am going to be racing in the 100m and 200m individual medley in the European Championships and this is the event that I am training for so this was a good start,” said Carlin.\n\n“I am not usually a 200m medley swimmer but my best event is the 100m backstroke and, when it came to a race choice, I am always going to take the backstroke so I was just pleased to go under 2:15, as it is my personal best.”\n\nCarlin also set a new British 50m backstroke record of 26.21 seconds in the heats and the semifinals.\n\n“I got a bit stuck with people in the first 50m of the race,” she said.\n\n“I couldn’t get going but I knew I had to make a push in the last 25m."

His life there became the basis of a plantation diary written by Francis Le Jau in 1741. The diary and other documents were later published as \"The Journal of Francis Le Jau, 1741–1743\", by Richard Hakluyt (the pseudonym of a 19th-century English writer). In the document Marocs and his fellow slaves are described as being part of the possessions of Captain Francisco Menendez Márquez, who died and willed them to his nephew Captain Don Jose Menéndez Márquez. \n\nAt the time of Le Jau's journal, Marocs had become a trusted member of the household, handling business transactions on the plantation. On August 5, 1742, he signed a contract of manumission with Captain Don Jose Menéndez Márquez. He became a free man, and was set up with a farm and a lifetime income, in exchange for his work as a steward on the plantation.\n\nSome time later, he was accused of killing a slave of his neighbour, Charles de Sauvinet. Marocs was sent to St. Augustine for trial, but was acquitted due to a lack of evidence. The local Spanish governor and slave owners took Marocs' acquittal as an insult, and made him wear an iron collar to publicly declare his guilt. The collar was fastened with an iron chain and ring around his neck and he was locked to the wall of the courthouse. Marocs would stay in St. Augustine for the next 12 years until the colonial government collapsed during the American Revolution.\n\nMarocs became a symbol of African resistance and a rallying cry for slaves during the Stono Rebellion of September 9, 1739. The rebellion of slaves and African free men, planned and carried out by a slave named Jemmy, began with an armed group of about twenty men killing two British traders. They marched south to the St. Augustine Parish church, where they broke into the weapons store. They then broke into the house of the militia leader, Lieutenant Governor William Bull. After killing him, the rebels marched to the St. Johns River, where they seized boats and rowed to freedom across the Santee River into the interior of South Carolina. There were 60 or so participants in the revolt, with 40 of them escaping and the rest either killed or captured. The colonial militia and British Army killed many of the captured rebels.\n\nThe Stono rebellion started a series of revolts in the British colonies. The revolt started the movement to end the slave trade and slavery in the Thirteen Colonies and led to the declaration of independence by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Fotu River (Manu)\n\nThe Fotu River is a river in the Northern Province of Papua New Guinea.

"[Editor’s note: We get a lot of submissions from industry organizations like RILA, NCPA, FMI, etc., and we love it when they are well-done. This piece was sent to us from FMI’s public affairs director Mike Haftka and was so good that we asked if we could publish it here. It has just a couple edits from the original. As always, all opinions are his own.]\n\nIt is clear that the well-organized government-sector labor unions have been spending big time to demonize farmers, and the rest of the industry as well, in an effort to advance their own interests. It is time to push back.\n\nWhile the politicians involved in the passage of the 2013 farm bill have been lionized for their actions, it was actually the members of the grassroots, the vast majority of whom are not farm owners, that saved the farm bill.\n\nAlthough the House of Representatives only received a 5 percent score from the AFBF, according to the FMI’s own scorecard, a significantly larger number of lawmakers voted with the FMI’s policy recommendations when it came time to actually cast a vote on the 2013 farm bill. That is a big difference, one that makes the distinction between the union’s demonization of farmers and the reality of farmers’ lives crystal clear.\n\nSome of the most vocal advocates of farmers in the media are organizations and individuals that are largely funded by the food stamp program. The same groups pushing to expand food stamps are lobbying for higher farm prices. Their message is confusing, even contradictory, and it simply does not resonate with voters.\n\nThe farm bill was also a big winner for consumers. The American Farm Bureau’s own report, which tracks consumer prices, found that the price of fresh fruits and vegetables fell by more than 9 percent in 2013. Americans may not like to think of farmers as price makers, but there is no question that low commodity prices resulted in lower prices for consumers.\n\nAs the current farm bill continues through the process, and in anticipation of the 2014 midterm elections, we need to make sure that the politicians we elect are being held accountable for the actual impacts of the farm bill.\n\nNo amount of lobbying is going to influence the farm bill debate if it is going to be followed by groups that are financed by the food stamp program. If these groups are going to lobby on behalf of farmers, then they need to learn how to talk like farmers.<|endoftext|>I have an icon on my page that will take you to a YouTube video.

"Even though Alabama didn’t have the most dominant recruiting year in the SEC this past year, it still finished ranked inside the top five, according to the 247Sports Composite.\n\nThere is a lot of time left until these recruits go to their respective colleges. Some are solid commitments, others may be headed to other schools or may even wind up in the draft. But for the moment, these rankings will make some people mad and others will praise them.\n\nHere’s how the 247Sports Composite, which averages the ratings from all major recruiting services, ranks the top 10 classes in the SEC.\n\nGeorgia, 3\n\nAlabama, 4\n\nLSU, 5\n\nAuburn, 6\n\nMississippi State, 7\n\nTennessee, 8\n\nSouth Carolina, 9\n\nFlorida, 10\n\nTexas A&M, 11\n\nArkansas, 12\n\nKentucky, 13\n\nMissouri, 14\n\nVanderbilt, 15\n\nOle Miss, 16\n\nAlabama didn’t have the best recruiting year, but it was still pretty damn good. And you could argue that these rankings aren’t that bad.\n\nYes, Alabama didn’t land a five-star recruit, but it did get the top player in the state and the top player at three different positions. Not many schools can claim that.\n\nIs this the year of Alabama? Yes No Submit Vote vote to see results Is this the year of Alabama? Yes 80.6%\n\nNo 19.4% Total votes: 2,397\n\nThere is still a lot of talent left on the board. Alabama has three more scholarships to give, and it will probably have a handful of five-star prospects.\n\nIt’s been a good couple of weeks for Alabama. This weekend it lost in embarrassing fashion to Auburn, but the win over LSU put the Tigers in the driver’s seat in the SEC West. The Tide is still playing for a national championship, and its defense has looked good as of late.\n\nIn 2013, Alabama had a good recruiting class, but it was nothing to get worked up over. This year, the Tide had a great class. We’ll see if the talent on the field matches the talent in the recruiting rankings.\n\nAll recruiting rankings via the 247Sports Composite.<|endoftext|>Baba Ramdev on Wednesday claimed that his company Patanjali Ayurved has received over Rs 150 crore orders for products like shampoo, honey, etc from abroad and is looking to export to 20-25 countries in the next 5 years.\n\nWhile sharing his company's five year plan for foreign expansion, Ramdev said, \"We are giving a boost to manufacturing of herbal products in India, while we are in talks with foreign countries for exports.\"\n\nTalking about the economic downturn, Baba Ramdev said, \"In an economic downturn, people become more health conscious, which helps companies like ours.\"\n\nWhen asked about Patanjali's foray into non-herbal products, Ramdev said, \"We will only come out with a few non-herbal products.\"\n\nPatanjali Ayurved's turnover in 2012-13 was over Rs 925 crore.

After striking out six in five innings, Vargas was credited with the win.\n\nWith the addition of Vargas, Detroit's pitching staff stands at 14 pitchers. He joins Michael Fulmer, Jordan Zimmermann, Daniel Norris, Matt Boyd and Anibal Sanchez as the group of starters.\n\n\"It's definitely a big adjustment,\" said Vargas, who has a 1-0 record and 5.91 ERA in four appearances with the Tigers this spring. \"You can't be as aggressive as you were in the past. But you kind of have to pick and choose your battles.\n\n\"You don't want to leave too many pitches up in the zone. You have to throw some early strikes, and you just have to be smart.\"\n\nManager Brad Ausmus said Vargas \"has handled it well\" this spring.\n\n\"He's looked like he's handled it pretty well,\" Ausmus said. \"And he has.\"\n\nVargas, who signed a minor-league contract with the Tigers in January, made 27 starts last season for the Kansas City Royals. He went 4-10 with a 5.26 ERA in his final season with the Royals. He said he will continue to mix and match between the rotation and the bullpen.\n\n\"He fits our roster well,\" Ausmus said. \"I think that he can come out of the bullpen and start.\"\n\nVargas said he's willing to do what the Tigers want him to do, but he wants to make it clear that he will continue to pursue the opportunity to start.\n\n\"If they want me to start, that's fine,\" he said. \"If they want me to come out of the bullpen, that's fine. But my goal is to start and to get back in there and pitch like I know I can pitch.\"\n\n-- Download the Detroit Tigers on MLive app for iPhone and Android.\n\n-- Follow MLive Sports on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.<|endoftext|>Josh, p. 20-21:\n\nThe charm of the notes seems to lie in the immediacy with which we can picture him dancing his way through the heady days of the late 1940s, with none of the baggage of fame to muffle his youth, as well as the old man who lived on my street, a retired dentist who probably remembered him, though I never met him. I have the feeling he was quite a prankster and a prankster with a big, booming, gregarious laugh. He clearly loved performing, loved toying with the crowd and, in these days, he had the added advantage of anonymity. All the times I have listened to these records, in my own living room and my car, I could never get over his delivery of “So Long, It’s Been Good to Know You”, the song that kicks off the first side of that first album. He sings in a half-spoken, half-sung manner, like a street-corner prophet of doom, with little ragged bursts of high lonesome sound on the top of certain words like “freedom”, “teeth”, and “freedom”.<|endoftext|>Bad Experience\n\nby Aileen\n\n(Oklahoma)\n\nThis happened a few years ago when my daughter was about two. It started as a few tantrums in a row, I'd finally find a toy she would be happy with and I'd go get some coffee and a few minutes later I'd hear screaming and I would go back in and she would be throwing the toy or just sitting there crying.\n\n\n\nThis happened for a few weeks, it was almost every day. Then one day she started talking about her friends in a different language. She knew what she was saying was wrong, she was very embarrassed by it.\n\n\n\nShe was saying things like \"I hate you.\" She would also be saying \"the cat wants to fight\" and stuff like that. At first I just assumed she was mimicking something she had heard but she kept saying things like \"can I be in your gang?\" Then she started talking about stuff that could only be her imagination. She would say things like \"I see your sister getting hit by a car, then a bunch of ghosts are standing around and your dad is talking to them.\" I was very concerned.\n\n\n\nI talked to the teacher about this and she said she'd been acting really strange in school and talking to her friends and not listening to anyone. She also would draw pictures and be laughing to herself.\n\n\n\nI finally took her to the doctor and she was diagnosed with OCD. They put her on some meds and it cleared up.\n\n<|endoftext|>Today I purchased an ice cream maker and a yogurt maker from an eBay seller with less than a positive review rating.

Humane Society.\n\nUnder the act, dogs are not allowed into P.E.I. unless they come from one of four designated “pre-approved” kennels, or a veterinarian’s office.\n\nThe province is trying to prevent the spread of rabies, which has not been found on the Island in at least 50 years.\n\nPeople on the Island who wanted to bring their dogs here, and weren’t sure about the regulations, had been asked to get in touch with P.E.I.’s animal control office.\n\nCBC P.E.I.’s Jessica Doria-Brown spoke with a staff member from the Humane Society who said the man who picked up the dog had said it was for a short visit.\n\nDogs that have to be quarantined for more than 10 days in P.E.I. are transported to the IWK in Halifax.\n\nThe Humane Society has not responded to our request for comment.\n\nCharges were laid after the Department of Health and Wellness received a complaint, the province’s Health Minister told CBC.\n\n“The concern that we have with rabies is that it’s not something that can be easily dealt with,” Robert Mitchell said.\n\n“If someone has the illness, they can spread it to other animals, and people are at risk.”\n\nMitchell said it’s up to the RCMP to enforce the regulations, and that he can’t comment on the specific case.\n\n“I’m not aware of any other such incidents,” Mitchell said. “It’s a very serious offence and I would certainly hope that people would be able to be advised on what the requirements are.”\n\nMitchell said that “If it turns out that there was an offence, then it’s the responsibility of the individual to be charged.”\n\nThe case will be heard in provincial court on Sept. 24.<|endoftext|>A 19-year-old man who died in a car crash in Carrick-on-Shannon in March was a \"bright young man who died too soon\", his family have said.\n\nA 19-year-old man who died in a car crash in Carrick-on-Shannon in March was a \"bright young man who died too soon\", his family have said.\n\nThomas O'Brien died after his car collided with another at the junction of the N4 and the L1337 at about 11.15pm on March 23.\n\nA 21-year-old man who was driving the other vehicle suffered only minor injuries.\n\nMr O'Brien, from Tubbercurry, was a student in NUI Galway.

Critics said his comments would only increase people's anger at gardaí, and his remarks were even likened to the U-turn made by British prime minister Theresa May, when she apologised for the \"hurt\" caused by austerity measures.\n\nAddressing the Joint Policing Committee in Dublin yesterday, Mr Leahy said that in some cases, people complaining about the length of time it takes for gardaí to arrive at the scene of an emergency should look at the state they are in.\n\n\"I think the point that I am making is that people look at the state of their clothing when they call the gardaí.\n\n\"A lot of times, if you are wearing a suit and tie when you call, a car will be there.\n\n\"When you call in a pair of pyjamas, it's a different story.\"\n\nHis comments were picked up by the Sunday Independent newspaper, which reported that Mr Leahy was taking an \"unusual step\" to appeal to the public to dress appropriately.\n\nThe assistant commissioner said it was \"unfortunate\" that members of the public would ring up and complain about the length of time it takes for gardaí to arrive.\n\n\"A lot of times they are in pyjamas, and it is unfortunate,\" he said.\n\nThe government's austerity programme, which led to tax rises, welfare cuts and the privatisation of state assets, led to Mr May being branded a \"U-turn queen\" in 2016.\n\nAnd just last week, it was revealed that the NHS spent almost €500,000 sending patients on holidays last year.\n\nThe Department of Health said it spent €4,707,959 on hospital tourism last year, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nSunday Independent<|endoftext|>Visitor safety and security are our top priority and we want to make sure you are fully informed and prepared for your visit.

This is useful for anyone using their computer as a home media center. I’ll give a very brief overview of VLC as I assume you are familiar with it. You can download the latest version of VLC for Windows here.\n\nDownload the remote control extension here.\n\nStep 1: Unzip the file and copy the WIRemote.dll file to VLC’s plugins folder. If you are using VLC 1.0.6, the default folder for plugins is C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\plugins. If you’re using a different version of VLC, check here.\n\nStep 2: Configure the Wiimote. Find the extension’s config file in your VLC directory and open it with notepad.\n\nStep 3: Set up the controller to work as a remote control by adding lines to the config file. Add the following to the bottom of the config file:\n\nAs you can see in the config file, the Wiimote is set up as a keyboard. Each button on the Wiimote can be configured to perform certain keyboard commands.\n\nStep 4: Run the VLC media player and click on Tools > Control Extensions. Under the Wiimote tab, select the channel from which you wish to control playback. Make sure that in the Remote Control section, you have set the Mode to Wiimote and have checked Enable. Click on OK and close the Control Extensions window.\n\nStep 5: Load the movie you wish to watch. Press the Wiimote’s A button and hold it down until the movie starts playing. The buttons on the Wiimote will become active. The up, down, left and right keys on the Wiimote correspond to the left, right, up and down arrow keys on the keyboard. The 1 key will bring up the video player and you can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through your movies and the enter key to select one. To play or pause, simply press the B button. The Select button acts as the enter key. Pressing Select while on the video player screen will take you to the movie’s directory. Press the Wiimote’s Home button to go back to the movie’s directory.\n\nYou can assign other keyboard keys to the other buttons on the Wiimote.

"The RSPCA is asking members of the public to be extra vigilant after a dog was shot in Bideford this week.\n\nThe injured animal was found on Friday, July 18.\n\nThe charity is working with the police in trying to trace the person responsible and is reminding the public to keep a look out for other animals, including wildlife, which could be in distress.\n\nBideford police station has been alerted to the incident and have confirmed that they have launched an investigation.\n\nThe dog, an adult German Shepherd cross, was found with an injury to its shoulder in Newland Park, Bideford.\n\nRSPCA inspector, Katie Forster, said: “This is absolutely appalling.\n\n“We are asking members of the public to be vigilant, especially in relation to wildlife.\n\n“Sadly, we do not know how the animal sustained this injury.\n\n“We are keeping an open mind as to what might have happened, but if you have any information that could help us please get in touch.\n\n“We do have some leads but would welcome further information as this would allow us to progress our investigation.\n\n“This could have been a lot worse and it is shocking that this dog has been shot.\n\n“I am appealing to members of the public to help us in our enquiries and help find the person responsible for doing this.\n\n“We do not know what the outcome of this may be for the dog but in cases like this the most likely outcome is that the animal will be put to sleep.\n\n“We are working closely with the police on this case and they are assisting with our enquiries.”\n\nAnyone with information should contact the RSPCA appeal line on 0300 123 8018.<|endoftext|>I know the title of this blog post is rather misleading. It sounds like I’m saying that women’s books are not worth reading. This is absolutely not what I’m saying. I think that women’s books can be just as great as men’s books and vice versa. I just happen to have read a lot of men’s books that I really enjoyed recently, so I thought I would recommend them to you.\n\nI hope you enjoy them as much as I have.\n\n1. Lonesome Dove – Larry McMurty\n\nI think this is probably my favorite book ever. It is such a sweeping story that you don’t want it to end. I still have the book (even though it’s really old and falling apart) and I’ve read it numerous times. I can’t get enough of Gus and Woodrow, and Captain Call. And I adore their “women,” Clara and Newt. I will recommend this book to anyone and everyone that I meet, and I love it so much I will probably read it again.\n\n2. Swimming to Catalina – Lynn Hall\n\nI found this book when I was at a thrift store on vacation. I was looking for a romance novel because they are my favorite books to read. I just can’t get enough of them. But I was shocked to find that this book was a romance book written by a man. It was a romance book in the style of a mystery. I have never read a book like it and I loved every minute of it. The characters are quirky and interesting and the romance is off the charts.\n\n3. How to Lose Friends and Alienate People – Toby Young\n\nThis book was one of my favorite reads last year. I knew the story of this guy, Toby Young, already. I’ve watched him on television and I’ve read some of his books. This one wasn’t a very happy read, though. In it, he details his misadventures with the British press and his life in New York City. The book was extremely funny, but there were also some very serious parts of the story. Toby is a character that I am sure I’ll be reading about for years to come.\n\n4. Lonesome Dove – Robert James Waller\n\nI read this book after reading Larry McMurty’s, but it was a completely different story. In this version, the two main characters are a man and a woman, and they are in their fifties. They decide to drive their herd of cattle across Texas to Montana. As they go on their journey they have many adventures, some are funny, some are serious. The romance between the two main characters was extremely interesting to read about. The last time I read it I was only twelve, so I had no idea what was going on. But I still loved it and I would read it again.\n\n5. The Chocolate War – Robert Cormier\n\nThis is another book that I’ve read multiple times, but I will read it again. The story is about a boy who lives at a Catholic school. His mother has recently died and he is being picked on by the school bully. He begins a “confrontation” with the bully by refusing to sell chocolates on the first day of school. After this, he is forced to join a secret organization at the school and he becomes involved in a lot of dangerous situations. This is one of the books that I recommend to most people, I think. It’s not my favorite, but it’s worth a read.\n\nAnd there you have it! The five books that I am recommending to you today. I hope that you enjoy them as much as I did!\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>San Francisco 49ers Tickets\n\nSan Francisco 49ers News\n\nSan Francisco 49ers Tickets\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are one of the most storied teams in all of football, the 49ers were one of the original teams in the NFL when they joined the NFL in 1950. At that time they were called the San Francisco Forty-Niners, a name that actually came from a fan who thought it would be a cool name. The 49ers original colors were red and gold and their logo was a little man in a red hat on top of a gold football. Those colors and the team name stuck with the 49ers for the next twenty-two years, but when the team moved to the Bay area they decided to make some changes. First they changed their team colors from red and gold to red, white, and blue. They also changed their logo to a flag that showed their new colors, and the man in the red hat was replaced with a miner from the mining days in the Bay area. Those changes stuck with the 49ers for almost thirty years, but when they moved to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California they decided it was time for another change. The Niners kept the same colors, but changed the logo to a more updated version of the old one. The miner was replaced by a red oval with the SF logo in the middle of it, and the new oval was inside a white oval, with a gold border around it.The 49ers were one of the founding members of the NFL, and they made their first playoff appearance in 1957, but did not win their first playoff game until 1982. Even with the bad records the Niners were one of the most well-known teams in the NFL. The Niners were the first NFL team to win five Super Bowl titles, and were named the team of the decade for the 1980s. Even with all of their success the Niners were in the cellar of the NFC West for many years, and that is why they had such a hard time making it to the playoffs. They had a couple of playoff runs in the 2000s, but they have not been to the Super Bowl since 1994.The Niners have made it to the Super Bowl five times, and they won five Super Bowls in the 1980s. They were the team of the decade for the 1980s, and their greatest coach was the legendary Bill Walsh. In the early years of the Niners the team was led by quarterbacks Joe Montana and Steve Young, but they could not get over the hump and make it to the Super Bowl. In the early nineties the Niners picked up a quarterback by the name of Steve Young and he became the greatest quarterback to ever wear the red and white. Young won the MVP award twice, and made it to six Pro Bowls before his career was cut short by an injury. The Niners were also led by running backs Joe Montana and Roger Craig, and wide receivers Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens. The Niners had the most dominant defense in football in the 1980s, and their success has not been matched since then.<|endoftext|>Every. Single. Time. When we get a winter like this one, I am reminded of the past. I am also reminded of how far I have come. I guess that’s a good thing.\n\nThis morning, I went to buy a donut from the bakery that is right next door to my job. I walked in and no one was there. I thought that was odd. It was 7:30am. When I opened the door to leave, there were three people behind the counter. They were counting money and filling up the pastry case. I said “hi” and the manager just said “hi” without making eye contact. No smile. No “thanks for coming in.” Nothing.\n\nJust a year ago, this would have affected me. I would have gone home and thought about it for hours. I would have been bummed. I would have been upset. I would have thought that the manager didn’t like me, or that the bakery didn’t like me, or something like that. I would have felt the weight of the world on my shoulders.\n"

We remain committed to delivering high quality products and great customer service to our customers,” Britt said in a statement.\n\nThe media and communications company posted earnings of $243 million, or 84 cents per share, on revenues of $5.8 billion. Both figures were better than analyst expectations. The company’s net income was down 15 percent from the previous year, but the earnings were still in line with the company’s previous forecast.\n\nTime Warner Cable said its core business operations grew 8.7 percent in the quarter. Total residential customers increased for the third consecutive quarter, increasing 1.7 percent to 11.8 million customers. The company also added 390,000 high-speed data customers in the quarter.\n\n“We continued to invest in our network to provide the best experience for our customers. In the quarter, we deployed more than 125,000 new customer premise equipment connections and performed nearly 800,000 installations,” Britt said. “In the quarter, we also significantly expanded our network capabilities to better deliver video and data over our network. We are pleased with the growth in our total high-speed data base, and are optimistic about our ability to continue to grow our business and create value for our customers and shareholders.”\n\nTime Warner Cable said it now serves more than 16 million video subscribers, which is nearly one-third of all basic video subscribers in the U.S. The company also said it has made improvements to its residential service bundle package, which now includes TV and broadband for $89.99 per month.\n\n“We are pleased with our continued revenue growth and our ability to produce excellent operating income and cash flow in the first quarter,” said Chief Financial Officer Irene Esteves. “With our steady business growth and the additional flexibility resulting from our recent access line divestitures, we are well positioned to execute on our initiatives to drive continued profitability.”\n\nImage via Flickr user Otto Timm.<|endoftext|>We have a brand new FREE movie and HD version on www.SHMOOZER.tv from the hit new movie KINGSMAN.\n\nSo check out the guys in the sexy suits on www.SHMOOZER.tv!\n\n\n\nIf you are in Los Angeles check out their new store in West Hollywood on Santa Monica Blvd at the corner of Sawtelle.\n\nAlso find them on: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest\n\nBe sure to visit their website for great sales, new releases, promotions, and events at: www.shmozer.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments<|endoftext|>Et par københavnske tøjfirmaer er mistænkt for at have hyret illegale børnearbejdere og krævet store bonusafregninger. Det er endnu for tidligt at sige, hvordan sagen ender.\n\nSagen om børnearbejde, hvor 11 hjemløse børn er kommet til Skandinavien som del af den kinesiske efterspørgsel på billig arbejdskraft, viser, at der er udfordringer i det danske arbejdsmarked.\n\nDet mener formanden for Socialpædagogerne, Benny Andersen, der dog kalder sagen meget begrænset i sin omfang.\n\n- Jeg er sikker på, at det er en meget lille andel af børn, der er ramt af det her, siger han til Ritzau.\n\nSagen kom frem, da en københavnsk virksomhed blev dømt i Københavns Byret for at have krævet børn i 10-årsalderen en bonus af virksomhedens økonomi.\n\n- Jeg tror, at der ikke er tale om, at mange danske virksomheder benytter sig af børnearbejdere, siger han.\n\nTilbage i 2010 var børnearbejde en helt stor sag, og her blev der gennemført en razzia mod virksomheder.\n\n- Vi kan konstatere, at der var problemer med udenlandske børn, som blev hyret som lønmodtagere. Det var der altså ikke i dag, hvor vi taler om børnearbejde, siger Benny Andersen.\n\nI 2010 var der tale om 28 virksomheder, som blev undersøgt.\n\nSiden har sager om børnearbejde, hvor de ansatte ikke har de fornødne papirer, været noget, man kender til fra området.\n\n- Det kommer vi tilbage til løbende, for vi kender til problematikken. Hvad der er foregået i denne her sag, er der nok ingen, der havde en idé om, siger formanden.\n\nDerfor skal der nu rettes op på problemet, mener Benny Andersen.\n\n- Når vi har en mulighed for at skaffe billig arbejdskraft fra udlandet, så vil vi selvfølgelig gøre det. Der skal laves en grænse for, hvornår man kan anvende udenlandske lønmodtagere, siger han.\n\nDer skal gøres op med, hvad der er håndværk og hvad der er industri, og de to skal ikke blandes sammen, mener Benny Andersen.\n\n- Det er også noget af det, der er udfordringen, og derfor skal vi have lavet de nødvendige kvalifikationskrav. Det betyder, at hvis du skal have lov til at arbejde i Danmark, så skal du have en uddannelse, og du skal være kvalificeret til det, siger han.\n\nDerudover skal der sættes en stopper for social dumping, og der skal strammes op på kontrol- og sanktionsmulighederne.\n\n- Sådan nogle her firmaer skal der ikke være lov til at være, siger Benny Andersen.\n\n/ritzau/<|endoftext|>Artist: Black Sabbath Album: Master Of Reality Song: Sweet Leaf Album Version Tabber: Julian Here is the master of reality album version.

A recent report by Kelley Blue Book indicates that sales of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) are gaining market share. As a result, Tesla is poised to benefit from the EV revolution.\n\nSource:Kelley Blue Book\n\nSales of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) have grown significantly from 2011 to 2013. In that span, the EV market share increased from .33 percent to 1.4 percent. Moreover, Kelley Blue Book predicts that EVs could account for 4 percent of new car sales in the US by 2020.\n\nTesla Motors is also poised to capitalize on this trend. The company is highly regarded as a leader in the EV market. Tesla’s Model S was named Motor Trend’s 2013 “Car of the Year” and was the Consumer Reports top rated EV of 2013.\n\nModel S sales are expected to increase significantly in 2014 as Tesla is rolling out more affordable models. Tesla is also benefiting from the increased supply of lithium-ion batteries. According to Lux Research, the EV market is growing at an average of 21.6 percent per year and is expected to grow to $7.5 billion in 2020.\n\nSource: Lux Research\n\nDespite these positive developments, Tesla shorts continue to prevail. Despite the gains in the stock price, Tesla shorts are sticking to their bearish bets. Tesla shorts have bet against the company for over three years. Currently, there are 35 million Tesla shares that are sold short, and the shorts are holding on to the shares despite the rebound in the stock price.\n\nSource:Bloomberg\n\nThe recent gains in the stock price have not been enough to satisfy short sellers. More than 27 million shares were sold short in the first quarter of 2014 alone. Tesla shorts are also comfortable with shorting the company at its current valuation.\n\nWith the current short interest, Tesla shorts could be forced to close their short positions by the end of the second quarter. However, some Tesla shorts could still be holding on to their positions despite the closing of the shorting window.\n\nIn the meantime, Tesla continues to deliver on its promises. The company continues to roll out its new product lines, and it is also opening new Tesla stores around the world.\n\nTesla shares continue to be a favorite short among hedge funds. According to FactSet, the shares are one of the most shorted companies in the S&P 500. Tesla short interest is more than three times higher than that of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and about five times higher than that of Ford Motor (NYSE:F).\n\nGeneral Motors short interest as of 04/02/2014\n\nFord Motor short interest as of 04/02/2014\n\nDespite the record short interest, Tesla is going from strength to strength. The company is expanding its product line, and it is well on its way to dominate the EV market. Additionally, the company has surpassed its 2014 production targets. In the meantime, Tesla shorts are in for a long wait.<|endoftext|>Imagine being chased by a giant predator, only to have it turn around and attack the other way because you’re wearing one of these…\n\nChased by a giant, hungry Tyrannosaurus rex, a creature of comparable size would be within its rights to be scared out of its mind.\n\nBut as it is a tiny dinosaur, one ‘prehistoric’ animal can’t help but giggle at the sight of a ferocious beast roaring at it.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe cute animal is shown with its mouth wide open as it tries to stifle a laugh at the absurdity of the situation.\n\nThe T-Rex is then heard screaming as it chases the creature around the field, only to turn around and flee after spotting the tiny intruder.\n\nThe clip, which is titled ‘I F**king Love Dinosaurs’, was created by 22-year-old American comedian and internet star Devin Graham, who has amassed nearly five million YouTube followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point in the video, the little dinosaur looks at the camera and waves at the viewer, which has led some viewers to believe that it was a real creature and not a computer-generated one.\n\nThe video was uploaded on April 13 and has already had over 70 million views.\n\nHowever, it has also been accused of being ‘disturbing’ by some viewers.\n\nWriting in the comments section, one viewer said: ‘This is one of the scariest videos on the internet.’\n\nAnother added: ‘That’s not a real dinosaur.

"Gonzaga’s Zach Collins, right, and Johnathan Williams react to a play during the Bulldogs’ matchup against San Diego State at Viejas Arena in San Diego on Dec. 3. The Bulldogs won, 78-59. (Photo: AP)\n\nThe always-lively discussion of the NCAA Tournament selection committee's biggest and best blunders (which usually is a list of blunders) has been further fueled by a freshman who's now in the mix for being one of the biggest and best picks of the first round in Thursday night's draft.\n\nAnd by all accounts, Gonzaga's Zach Collins was, in fact, one of the biggest and best players in the nation this past season.\n\nDarn it, somebody in the official outfit that has the Final Four placements, the brackets and the selections did a superb job in providing a team that was vastly superior to a top-10 team with a second chance to participate in a college basketball tournament.\n\nZach Collins, a 7-foot, 230-pound center from Las Vegas, was the team's third-leading scorer this past season, behind Przemek Karnowski and point guard Nigel Williams-Goss.\n\nBuy Photo University of Nevada head basketball coach Eric Musselman coaches during the second half of his team's NCAA basketball game against the Boise State Broncos at Lawlor Events Center in Reno on Thursday, February 16, 2017. Nevada won 76-69. (Photo: Tom R. Smedes/Special to the RGJ, Tom R. Smedes/Special to the RGJ)\n\nCollins was instrumental in Gonzaga's winning the West Coast Conference tournament and advancing to the Elite Eight. He scored 20 points in the first half in the opening-round win over Texas Southern, and that was one of the top performances in the tourney.\n\nCollins is slated as a lottery pick in the draft. His brother, 6-9-180 center John Collins of Wake Forest, also is in the mix as a first-round pick.\n\nHere's the thing: What if Collins had chosen to play for the Wolf Pack this past season? The WCC would have been a little bit better. The Zags would have been less impressive.\n\nHe would have played in the Mountain West, and in most cases, there was not a huge discrepancy between the Mountain West and the WCC in the 2016-17 season. In the first seven games of the season, Nevada won five times, which was nearly identical to the Zags' win total over the same period.\n\nFor the season, Gonzaga was 33-2, and Nevada was 28-7. The Zags played in the NCAA Tournament. The Wolf Pack didn't.\n\nWas Collins a first-round pick in that alternate reality? Probably not, but there's a good chance he would have been drafted, and it would have been by one of the NBA teams that had an interest in him.\n\nWilliams-Goss decided to transfer to Gonzaga from Washington, but had he stayed in Seattle, Collins would have been recruited by the Huskies. In the end, it may have been a long shot that Collins would have accepted the scholarship, but then again, who knew he would be such a talent?\n\nBut, maybe Collins did decide to play for the Wolf Pack, and then maybe Williams-Goss stayed in Seattle.

(Photo: AP Photo/Mark Wallheiser)\n\nMIAMI — In an extraordinary late-night series of events on the opening day of the Florida legislative session, Republican Sen. Frank Artiles resigned from his seat after the South Florida political community expressed outrage over his conduct.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Artiles cited the “harmful and embarrassing distractions” his presence would cause his fellow senators, his constituents and the people of Florida. The resignation is effective at midnight.\n\nBut Artiles’ tenure in the Florida Senate wasn’t going to last much longer anyway.\n\nAfter his racist and sexist remarks to two African-American senators were made public on Wednesday, he was facing expulsion proceedings from the Florida Senate.\n\nA little more than 24 hours later, he was gone.\n\n“This was not an easy decision to make, but I do believe it is in the best interest of my constituents,” Artiles said in his resignation letter. “I apologize to my family, friends and most importantly to my constituents.”\n\nMore: Sen.

Jack Latvala of Clearwater, filed a resolution Wednesday night to begin proceedings.\n\nLatvala's resolution said Artiles “used offensive, racist and disrespectful language” during an exchange on the Senate floor with fellow Democratic Sen. Audrey Gibson of Jacksonville and Democratic Sen. Perry Thurston of Fort Lauderdale.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday night, Senate President Joe Negron, R-Stuart, said he was “appalled” by Artiles’ comments and said Artiles will publicly apologize to Gibson and Thurston on the Senate floor Thursday morning.\n\nCLOSE State Sen. Frank Artiles explains why he apologized on the Florida Senate floor Wednesday, April 19, 2017.\n\n“Racial slurs and profane, sexist insults have no place in conversation between Senators and will not be tolerated while I am serving as Senate President,” Negron said. “Senator Artiles has requested a Senate apology. I understand his decision to resign and appreciate his willingness to do the right thing.”\n\nLater, Negron released a statement saying Artiles has resigned.\n\nLatvala said in a brief interview Thursday that the chamber was expected to approve his resolution on a “voice vote” — with the expectation that Artiles would be expelled.\n\n“The public expected us to take action, and I was going to be the one who was going to do it,” Latvala said.\n\nBut he said the resignation was an unexpected turn of events. “It’s amazing,” he said.\n\nLatvala said Artiles’ Republican colleagues would have been happy to expel Artiles, but he added, “I don’t think that was his goal, or I don’t think he expected it.”\n\nLatvala also criticized the Senate Democratic caucus for not publicly demanding Artiles’ resignation. He said he wasn’t sure whether the chamber would have expelled Artiles had he not resigned.\n\n“We would have done something,” he said.\n\nLatvala said Artiles’ resignation means the Senate will hold a “lame-duck” session in which he will be able to collect a paycheck for about two more months.\n\n“It’s the taxpayers’ money,”"

"Maybe it's because this was the only game in town, but both of these types of games have grown stale to me. I feel a lot of that is due to having seen the pattern so often that I know when the surprises are coming. I have not played Final Fantasy XII yet but I have no reason to think that this one is going to be any different. The only thing I can say that would be new is that the maps are going to be quite large. And even that is starting to feel more like a gimmick and less like something that adds to the game play. If it weren't for this system, I wouldn't be able to enjoy these games.\n\n\n\nWhile this system isn't perfect, it's better than the way it was in FFX. This system allows you to do things without being tied to one person or just your party. If I had any complaint, it would be that you still have to level up.\n\n\n\nAlso, a lot of people are saying that it will be more like X. While I agree that it's a lot like X, it's also much like X-2. That is, you get a new license board to progress the characters. You're given more freedom to change up your party and strategy. You have a lot of new abilities for the characters to use.\n\n\n\nI actually really enjoy both of these games. As far as I'm concerned, it's a toss up between X and XII. Either game would have been fine to be the last game in the series. I don't think there was a bad choice between the two. If there is one difference between the two, it's that XII is a lot more fast paced. I don't feel the need to grind as much in XII. Also, I like that you get more character development in XII.\n\n\n\nI just don't see the problem with having more than one person telling you what to do. It just depends on the story as to who it will be. It's not going to be every single person you meet. And if you have so much dialogue with everyone you meet, the game would become boring really fast.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to say if the game is going to be good or not. I'm not going to complain if it isn't, though. The game is out of Nomura's hands and even if it is a bit different from the previous games, that doesn't mean it's bad.<|endoftext|>\n\nTags\n\nBack to list of posts\n\nThe reason for this is that in this kind of market, you don't want to be in an equity investment. You want to be in safe securities which don't fluctuate too much. Like CDs. If you keep a fixed amount of money in a CD and the interest rate stays constant (or goes up), you know that your fixed amount is not going to fluctuate in value by too much.So, to start, let's think about some long term goals that you have. What do you want to do 5 years from now? 10 years? 20 years? Where would you like to be financially? Have you set some specific goals for yourself?This is my story. In the meantime I will be working on getting that monkey off my back and regaining control of my life. Its very hard and as Ive said before, very humbling. Im not a perfect person. But I am a person with potential. I know this for a fact because I have seen my potential and I have achieved it. And now I have this debt and it has me worried and scared. I have my heart set on purchasing a house in the near future and I know that this has to happen for that to happen.When people are looking for financial advice they usually get a lot of conflicting information. Some may even suggest that they put all of their money into gold and that is the best place to put it. However, if you are looking to learn more about gold and where the best places are to invest your money, you need to keep reading. And with the Olympics out of the way, I'd like to know, where does the free market lead us now. Something like a new commercialization of Olympism. Something much more like the Great Global Gladiators' Track & Field Stadia Circus. Something a little more like the Disneyworld of the future. Or maybe, something a little more like the planet Saturn. Possibly more like the Cold War, played out to the bitter end.I've been through some very rough times in the last two years. I have lost my father to cancer and I have lost my best friend to financial troubles. I've also spent the last two years unemployed. I worked for several months to earn money to pay for my wedding. But shortly after I was married, I lost my job. Then my husband lost his job. And our financial situation really started going downhill. I knew I needed to take control of the situation and I knew I needed to do it fast.I started by looking for a second job. I found one working in a local deli, but it didn't pay much. We cut back on our expenses as much as we could. We also looked into some debt management programs. Unfortunately, none of the debt management programs I looked at seemed to work for our situation. They all wanted us to sign up for a 3 or 5 year program and our creditors were so aggressive that it didn't seem like that would be a good idea.So I went looking for financial advice. I found a website that gave me some really great ideas about how to pay off our debt. They suggested the debt snowball technique. With the debt snowball technique you start paying off the debts with the lowest balances. You pay as much as you can on these debts each month and you throw every extra penny you can at them. As these debts get paid off, you roll the money that you were using to pay off those debts into the next highest balance debt. This helps to increase your debt payoff each month and really gets things moving in the right direction.The debt snowball technique worked great for us. We got the money we needed to pay off our debts and we didn't have to make any sacrifices at all. I highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with debt. It can really work great for you if you can find the extra money to throw at your debts.It's a good question, because it's a hard question to answer. If you are very motivated to make a lot of money fast, I'd recommend you go with your passion. You are likely to enjoy it more, and as a result you will work hard to make it happen. A related question that people often ask is, \"What is the best industry to start a business?\" I recommend that you start by picking an industry you enjoy, rather than trying to find the \"best\" industry.I believe the hardest part is getting a home business started. If you are new to internet marketing, you probably don't have a large following yet. Your best chance of succeeding is by offering people some sort of freebie. If you can get enough people to follow you, you can begin to make money.<|endoftext|>[SI-LIST] Re: Some more responses on DAI\n\nI just got my FPGA design up and running and I'm not sure what is\n\nwrong.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are the next generation of royalty, but they have been married long enough that it’s possible to see some of the ways in which Meghan has begun to influence the royal family in her short time as a member of it. She has a busy schedule as a royal and still finds time to make the world a better place, and that includes doing her best to break down gender roles in the monarchy and challenge perceptions of what it means to be a royal bride.\n\n\n\nWhile she has been criticized by some for the way she dresses, she’s also done her part to change the way royal brides have traditionally looked in the past, as well as the types of charitable efforts they’ve participated in to promote their causes.\n\n\n\nMeghan’s influence is evident in the family as it adapts to the more progressive changes that she brings to the monarchy. She’s done everything from change her last name to start a new royal legacy and represent women’s right to equality, to giving a voice to the marginalized through her various charitable causes.\n\n\n\nIn the spirit of changing the royal narrative, let’s take a look at some of the ways Meghan has broken the mold as a royal bride, and what that means for the future of the monarchy.\n\n\n\n1. Using her platform to make a change\n\nMeghan’s position as the Duchess of Sussex gives her a unique platform that allows her to promote causes she cares about, from racial equality to gender equality to her favorite charities. She’s used that platform to make a difference for women and girls.\n\n\n\n2. Being the face of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements\n\nShe was the first royal to speak out about the #MeToo movement, the backlash against women speaking out about sexual harassment and abuse, and what she calls the “heavy burden” of being a woman in the public eye. In a rare interview with the BBC, she spoke about how she’s always been aware of how sexism and racism have been barriers that she had to overcome, and that she is pleased to see the MeToo and Time’s Up movements making their mark on society and the public at large.\n\n\n\n3. Standing by her husband during the #MeToo movement\n\nShe made a conscious decision not to speak out about the backlash against her husband’s former girlfriends, like her rumored rival Meghan Markle, as she has refused to criticize other women. She doesn’t play the victim, but instead encourages women to speak out against abuse and fight for equality in every aspect of their lives.\n\n\n\n4. Becoming a philanthropist and charity ambassador\n\nShe’s been an ambassador for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) since the beginning of 2018. She promotes their various projects, including the fight against the water crisis in East Africa, and the importance of providing women and children with safe drinking water and adequate sanitation services.\n\n\n\n5. The fashion choices she makes as a royal bride\n\nWhile Meghan is often criticized for her outfits and looks by members of the public, she’s broken a few rules and worn clothes that had never been worn by previous royal brides. She’s broken the tradition of a royal bride wearing all white by wearing a black pantsuit by Stella McCartney to her wedding. She’s also chosen a number of different designers for her wedding gowns, and has worn outfits that are a little more modern in their style.\n\n\n\n6. As a role model for women and girls\n\nMeghan has made it clear that she wants to use her influence to promote the idea that women and girls can do and be anything, including princesses. She’s spoken openly about the obstacles she faced as a biracial woman in America and has spoken about how her mother taught her to be strong, to never give up, and to push through any obstacles.\n\n\n\n7. Using her fame to help women in other countries\n\nShe’s spoken about how the public should be “mindful” of women in other countries when they’re giving out opinions and criticisms about women and their clothing. She wants to ensure that women from different cultures are able to make decisions for themselves about what they wear and how they present themselves to the world.\n\n\n\n8. Embracing and changing royal tradition\n\nShe’s already had two official residences as a royal wife, making it clear that she’s going to have her own role and position in the monarchy. She’s also kept her maiden name and made it clear that she won’t be taking the traditional route for royal brides by doing so. She’s already used her influence to change royal tradition and make it more inclusive for women, as well as to make her own path in the monarchy.\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that Meghan has made it her mission to challenge the perception of what it means to be a royal bride, and change the way that the monarchy interacts with the public. She’s already taken steps to set herself apart from other royal brides and has broken the mold in so many ways that future royal brides are sure to look to her as a role model.<|endoftext|>Manual de Técnicas de Neuromarketing\n\nPor Richard A.

She is a very brash, temperamental monarch who holds her court in the presence of playing cards.\n\nContents show]\n\nHistory Edit\n\nMadness Edit\n\nOne day, the White Rabbit was late for a very important date. It was the Queen of Hearts' desire that all subjects be on time and therefore she accused the rabbit of stealing her tarts. The poor creature was sentenced to death, but Alice interceded and the rabbit was saved. The Queen became suspicious of Alice and ordered her execution. However, the child escaped from the palace and the Queen's guards.\n\nAlice soon met the White Rabbit and they followed the March Hare and the Hatter to the cottage of the Dormouse. After a long conversation, the Mad Hatter ordered her servants to seize the White Rabbit and bring it to the trial. Alice entered the scene again and the Queen ordered her death sentence. She then asked for an executioner and it was the Knave of Hearts who came to execute her.

It was found that addition of RCA in TEMPO-O/HTP systems greatly affected the color change of the color reagent (CRC) to orange-brown, and the color intensity varied with the concentration of Na. Increasing the concentration of RCA in the system was found to affect the nature of the color change; whereas, when RCA was present at low concentration (0.01 mmol/L), it induced the color to change from orange-brown to pink-red at pH 2.5, but caused a second change in color from pink-red to dark brown-black at pH 9.5. In contrast, when RCA was present at high concentration (0.1 mmol/L), it induced the color change from orange-brown to dark brown-black at pH 2.5, and from orange-brown to red at pH 9.5. It was also found that RCA increased the rate of TEMPO reduction in the absence of HTP, and the redox peaks at +0.53 V and +0.25 V could be observed in the 1H NMR spectra of the RCAT system. The ability of RCA to function as a redox mediator for HTP reduction is important in controlling the color of the CRC system, and can be used as a promising approach to develop novel colorimetric assay systems.

He stalks her, but when she finds out about it, she is flattered and falls in love with him. - Written by John Oswalt <jao@jao.com>\n\nIn France in 1951, an idealistic and wistful young film student, Gerard (Gilbert Becaud) is in love with the American film star Judy Garland, who is starring in a musical film there, as he follows her around to get an interview with her. At first he is confused by the older men who pursue the film star for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is that he meets a fellow student, Guy (Daniel Ceccaldi) who is also smitten with the star. Eventually he works up the nerve to talk to her and then just follows her around, as she is put up in a luxurious suite and given flowers and chocolates. After a few weeks he is exhausted, but takes some time off to visit his sick father. He arrives back just as the film wraps up, and the first thing she does is to make a phone call to his hotel. This encounter is not in the script, but it will change his life. - Written by garykmcd\n\nIn 1950s France, a young film student named Gerard takes a break from the Paris film school where he's been trying to interview Hollywood star Judy Garland, and heads for the country to visit his ailing father. By the time he returns to Paris, the studio that was producing Garland's film has shut down and the star has left town. Gerard decides to give up his pursuit of Garland and heads back to the country. That's when he bumps into her and is summarily invited to her hotel room. It's there that Gerard learns that he and Garland have a lot in common. And he's stunned to find out that the young woman he's been pursuing is also smitten with him. - Written by frankfob2@yahoo.com<|endoftext|>Код:\n\n<div class=\"container\"> <h1 class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"index.html\">診療科目一覧</a> </h1> <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"> <li><a href=\"#\">診療科目一覧</a></li> <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">診療科目名</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"container\"> <h1 class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"index.html\">診療科目一覧<span class=\"icon-home\"></span></a> </h1> <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"> <li><a href=\"#\">診療科目一覧</a></li> <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">診療科目名</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"container\"> <h1 class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"index.html\">診療科目一覧<span class=\"icon-home\"></span></a> </h1> <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"> <li><a href=\"#\">診療科目一覧</a></li> <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">診療科目名</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"container\"> <h1 class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"index.html\">診療科目一覧<span class=\"icon-home\"></span></a> </h1> <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"> <li><a href=\"#\">診療科目一覧</a></li> <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">診療科目名</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"container\"> <h1 class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"index.html\">診療科目一覧<span class=\"icon-home\"></span></a> </h1> <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"> <li><a href=\"#\">診療科目一覧</a></li> <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">診療科目名</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"container\"> <h1 class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"index.html\">診療科目一覧<span class=\"icon-home\"></span></a> </h1> <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"> <li><a href=\"#\">診療科目一覧</a></li> <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">診療科目名</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"container\"> <h1 class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"index.html\">診療科目一覧<span class=\"icon-home\"></span></a> </h1> <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"> <li><a href=\"#\">診療科目一覧</a></li"

It is a condition that often occurs on babies with sensitive skin, and it is characterized by red, itchy rashes that can cause the baby to scratch. These rashes are the result of contact dermatitis, which can also be caused by substances such as chemicals, topical creams and other soaps. The irritation can be extremely bothersome to the baby, and the rash itself can be uncomfortable. In some cases, however, a rash may not be the result of diaper dermatitis. If the diaper rash does not respond to treatment or does not go away, it could be a sign that your baby has a more serious condition.\n\nDiaper dermatitis is an irritating and painful rash that can occur on the skin of a baby's diaper area. This condition can occur at any age and is characterized by red, itchy rashes that often become raw and develop a crusting appearance. Treatment typically involves the application of a topical cream, with limited success. Often, the rash does not respond to the cream or appears again the next time the baby wears a diaper. When this occurs, the diaper dermatitis is typically caused by a product in the baby's diet, such as a food or a topical cream.\n\nIf you have tried all kinds of different creams, but are still dealing with a diaper rash, it is possible that the rash is not caused by a diaper. Instead, it could be caused by a food allergy or an allergy to a topical cream. Both of these allergies can present as an irritating rash on the baby's diaper area. You can find out if the rash is caused by a food by eliminating the baby's diet one food item at a time and watching to see if the rash disappears. It is important to note that if the baby is lactose intolerant, the rash may clear up when you stop giving the baby any milk products, even if the allergy is not caused by a food.<|endoftext|>\n\nnew file mode 100644\n\nindex 0000000..8a9b6e4\n\n--- /dev/null\n\n+++ b/ diff --git a/block/block.c b/block/block.cnew file mode 100644index 0000000..8a9b6e4--- /dev/null+++ b/ block/block.c @@ -0,0 +1,269 @@ +/* + * Copyright (C) 2006 ARM Limited + * Copyright (C) 2010 Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. + * + * See file CREDITS for list of people who contributed to this + * project. + * + * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or + * modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as + * published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of + * the License or (at your option) any later version. + * + * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, + * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of + * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The 1.8 km (1.1 mile) long circuit runs through the city's Condado and Miramar districts, beginning at Ashford Avenue, crossing the length of Ashford Avenue, going along the beach in front of the Sheraton Hotel, and ending at the Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza Hotel. The track is made up of city streets and is laid out in a clockwise direction.\n\nIn 1986, with the purpose of developing a Formula One event in the Americas, the Tourism Development Fund (FDF) carried out the studies and groundwork to design a track similar to those used in Indianapolis, Monaco and Adelaide.\n\nA track was laid out in downtown San Juan, covering the length of Ashford Avenue, Paseo de la Princesa and Calle San Francisco. It crossed Avenida La Playa and the entrance of the Sheraton Hotel, continuing towards the Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza Hotel. After two years, this would become the first Formula One circuit in the Caribbean. The event, organized by the FDF, was held in the month of October. It was only the second race of the season, held in Latin America, and the third race of the season in the Americas. The first race was held in Brazil and the second race in Mexico.\n\nThe first race was held on October 9, 1988 and was won by Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna.

It is part of the Boston National Historical Park.\n\nAccording to the City of Cambridge, the Common \"evokes the birth of American Democracy.\" The Common was used by the first settlers of Boston as a grazing pasture for cattle and livestock, but became a Town Common after the Town of Cambridge was created in 1630. The City of Cambridge states that, \"The Common was used for military drilling and mustering during the 17th and 18th centuries, and the militia members were occasionally quartered on the Common.\" It was used as a camp by the British before the American Revolutionary War began in 1775.\n\nA detailed history of the Cambridge Common can be found at the Cambridge Common Historical Society.\n\nA map of the Revolutionary War Battle of Cambridge shows the disposition of the troops and how they moved to various positions. The common was used as a camp ground during the Siege of Boston and as a muster ground in 1775, as well as for training and drilling. The British had guns placed on it, and during the battle it was used by both sides.\n\nGeorge Washington's first headquarters were near the Common at the John Vassall House, which stood in what is now Harvard Yard. He moved his headquarters to less exposed quarters across the Charles River in October 1775.\n\nThe Common is also home to a memorial honoring General Abner Doubleday, who is erroneously credited with inventing baseball. The memorial is a statue of Doubleday in front of the Doubleday Field gate to the common. It is one of two such statues, the other being in Cooperstown, New York. Doubleday was in fact a lifelong baseball fan who may have been involved in developing the game while a cadet at West Point, but he did not actually invent the game.\n\nThe main area of the Common is a flat, grassy field interspersed with trees, with a small, man-made lake in the center. Along its borders are brick sidewalks. Two 18-hole disc golf courses were installed in 1981, and two more in 1988. The latter two are technically on the Cambridge Common Golf Course, an adjacent parcel of land in Belmont that was purchased by the city in the 1980s, where the former driving range was converted into a grass field surrounded by trees, and where two 18-hole courses were built. The National Park Service states that \"The Common, as well as the eighteenth century Bow and Arrow and original disc golf courses are accessible and used for passive recreation from dawn to dusk, daily.\"\n\nThe Common is the site of several statues and memorials, most prominently the Civil War Memorial Grove, which features the Civil War Memorial and a monument to General George S. Patton, Sr. who was from Cambridge and a former U.S. Congressman, and a statue of George Washington.\n\nThere is also a memorial to Ephraim Gerrish, one of the first to die in the American Revolutionary War. There is a monument to local soldiers who have fallen in the Iraq War. The stone monument is in the shape of a star, and the name of the fallen is inscribed on the star's points.\n\nA statue of Civil War general Robert Gould Shaw, sculpted by Daniel Chester French and Augustus St. Gaudens, stands on the Common as part of the Shaw Memorial. The memorial was originally located on nearby Boston Common but was moved to the Cambridge Common in 1904 to allow access by more people, and is one of the first monuments to an African American. The second statue, depicting Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe with a young student, is located in the nearby Simches Corner section of the Boston Public Garden, a short walk from the main Common. Howe is best known as the co-founder of the Perkins School for the Blind, and the statue is a popular destination for school field trips.\n\nThe \"Civil War Memorial\" on the Common was completed in 1872. It was designed by Henry Howard, architect of the famed Memorial Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts. The memorial was partially paid for by George Washington Gould, a local resident who made his fortune in California gold fields. The granite obelisk is tall and is the second largest granite monument in the United States, surpassed only by the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. Its inscription reads \"Erected in Memory of the Soldiers from Cambridge Who Fought For the Union in the War of 1861-1865.\"\n\nThere is a small plaque next to the monument listing the names of the men from Cambridge who fought in the war. The bronze statue of a Civil War infantryman located next to the monument was designed by Augustus Lukeman and cast in 1874.\n\nIn 2004, the monument was restored and renovated by a group of local volunteers. The restoration included sandblasting the obelisk, repairing the granite, and repainting the soldier. A new monument, which also listed the names of soldiers from Cambridge who died in the Vietnam War, was added to the memorial. The Civil War Memorial, along with the Paul Revere Memorial, is one of the first two structures in Massachusetts to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe central water feature in the park is the \"Polar Bear Plunge,\" a fountain that is operational from April through October, which was built in 1967. This is located in front of the the main library. There is also a fountain that is off in a small gazebo to the west.\n\nThe \"Col. George Armistead Monument\" was dedicated on the Cambridge Common on September 17, 1872. It was donated by the Grand Army of the Republic. The Monument commemorates Col. Armistead who was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 3, 1863. He was carried from the field and taken to Cambridge. After his recovery he returned to duty in 1864. His death occurred in 1895. His remains are buried in the family cemetery in Maryland.\n\nThe \"Civil War Memorial\" is located in the center of the Common, and is surrounded by the Civil War Battle"

Joe Kennedy, D-Brookline, has announced his intention to run for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. Warren has not said whether she intends to run for re-election or for another position.\n\nLesser announced his candidacy in April. He is running for office to represent the 4th Congressional District and \"ensure that our economic future is rooted in Longmeadow, Springfield and beyond,\" he said.\n\nIn 2014, Lesser served as field director for U.S. Sen.

A third-person telling of the life of Joshua, from his birth to his death, it tells his story in a very gripping manner. It’s exciting and fun to read, yet has some serious substance in the way of historical accuracy.\n\nI would highly recommend this book, even for those who are not interested in Christian books. The book is simply that good.<|endoftext|>Here we go again.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I wrote a piece about my fear of the upcoming NFL season. My argument was essentially that the Super Bowl has been set up for a possible matchup between two of the greatest quarterbacks of all time in Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, and since neither of those guys will be participating in the playoffs, the Super Bowl will lose much of its luster.\n\nThe post was titled, “Why the NFL is a failure this season,” and it was the first post I ever wrote for this site. Now, I’m back again, and this time, I’m not trying to be negative at all.\n\nNot in the least.\n\nI am simply using the same outline as before to explain how I think the NFL has gotten it right this season, from start to finish. It’s simply that there are some unique circumstances surrounding the upcoming season that make it much better than usual.\n\nHere’s the original post, if you missed it.\n\nHere’s my new one.\n\nHow the NFL Is Doing It Right\n\n“What is right is always on the side of the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the majority.” — Oscar Wilde\n\nThe NFL, as an organization, has made some questionable decisions this season. A prime example of this is the handling of the Bountygate scandal, where the Saints organization was accused of offering cash incentives for vicious hits. The NFL should have punished the organization much more harshly, but they ended up settling for an ill-advised one-year suspension of head coach Sean Payton, a six-game suspension for Saints’ defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, and the loss of second-round draft picks in 2013 and 2014. This punishment was, in my opinion, much too light for such a heinous act, but it seems as though the league is finally cracking down on violent, illegal play.\n\nI’m sure you’ve heard the term “Deflategate” going around lately. As I’m sure you know, this is a slang term for the controversy surrounding the pressure in the footballs used during the AFC Championship game between the Patriots and Colts. The NFL is now investigating this issue to determine whether or not the Patriots tampered with the footballs, or if they were simply deflated by other means. If they did indeed tamper with the balls, it’s possible that the Patriots could be stripped of the win, and lose draft picks as well.\n\nThese are just two examples of the NFL doing something wrong this season, but they are both minor, compared to all the things they have done right. For instance, this is the first season since 1970 that has featured a team that had gone undefeated for the season. The league has never had a repeat champion since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970, and this season, that has already been changed. The Broncos have won the Super Bowl, so they have now become the first team to ever repeat as champs.\n\nAnother reason why the NFL has done it right this season is that it has followed the trend of unpredictability. For instance, there is a common misconception that the AFC is a better conference than the NFC, and that it’s easier to win games in the AFC than in the NFC. However, this season, this was not the case. The NFC was the conference with the most wins, and of the five teams with the best records, three of them were NFC teams. It’s safe to say that the NFC was the better conference this season.\n\nIt seems as though the NFL has followed the trend of unpredictability, not only by having a weaker conference beat a stronger conference (see the Broncos vs. the Panthers), but also by allowing lesser teams to rise to the top. The best example of this is the Kansas City Chiefs. As I am sure you know, the Chiefs are the only team in NFL history to start a season 9-0, and then finish it 1-5. They ended up with the worst record in the AFC West, and they didn’t even win a single divisional game. This unpredictability is also evidenced by the fact that the Patriots were not one of the teams to make it to the playoffs.\n\nAnother reason why the NFL has done it right this season is the overall unpredictability of the playoffs. When looking at this season’s playoffs, there are many different storylines, and each of them is interesting to look at. The three wild card teams in the NFC all have very good quarterbacks. The two divisional games have three great quarterbacks. The three conference championship games have one of the greatest quarterbacks ever, Peyton Manning, and two of the greatest quarterbacks ever, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.\n\nWhile the Super Bowl is more predictable, there are still plenty of storylines in that game as well. Peyton Manning has been the story of the season. He is on track to become the most prolific quarterback in NFL history, and it would be great for him to get his second Super Bowl title. The last time he won a Super Bowl, the NFL was not as popular as it is now, and it would be a good way to end his career. The other storyline is the attempt by Seattle to get back to the Super Bowl. As I wrote earlier, the Super Bowl will be more interesting this season if the Seahawks and Broncos are playing in it, because both teams have very good quarterbacks.\n\nHow could you not be excited about a game that will have three of the top ten quarterbacks in the NFL, and possibly the greatest quarterback of all time?\n\nIn addition to these storylines, there are plenty of other things that make the NFL’s current situation look better. The most obvious one is that Peyton Manning’s career is at an end. It’s"

Porter's latest album, Take Me to the Alley, opens with a moody version of \"Tears in Heaven,\" the Eric Clapton ballad that went to No. 1 in the U.K. in the wake of the guitarist's son's tragic death. In the studio, Porter reworks the tune with the help of Branford Marsalis. But even without the celebrated saxophonist, Porter pulls off the challenging ballad with incredible ease, and the results are, like so much of his music, brilliant.\n\nPorter's grasp of standards is no surprise. Born in California, the jazzman is the product of a mixed marriage — his father is African-American and his mother is a Chinese immigrant from Hong Kong. As a boy, Porter learned to love jazz by listening to his father's records of saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. and trumpeter Donald Byrd. He began his singing career with gospel music, however, and it wasn't until the singer's late 20s that he began to study jazz.\n\nAfter an apprenticeship in local San Francisco clubs, Porter moved to the East Coast, where he became the star of the jazz festival circuit. He released his debut album, Water, in 2012. That record, too, was front-loaded with several covers, including Bill Withers' \"Ain't No Sunshine.\" The song won him a Grammy for best Jazz Vocal Album.\n\nPorter's latest release, Take Me to the Alley, follows in the same footsteps. The album is named for a Harlem club where the performer was discovered by a fellow club-goer. Like the standard version of \"Tears in Heaven,\" the record's first track, \"Don't Lose Your Steam,\" is the kind of song that Porter can and does make his own. But Take Me to the Alley is also notable for its inclusion of original material. \"I'm Nobody\" is the title track, and it's a heartbreaking song of resignation: \"I'm nobody / Nobody but me.\" \"Elias\" tells the story of the biblical prophet in a way that's simultaneously soothing and haunting.\n\nIt's not all jazz on the new record. Porter delivers two great pop tracks, singing with restraint and sophistication on covers of Bob Marley's \"Is This Love\" and Roy Ayers' \"Everybody Loves the Sunshine.\" But those songs don't necessarily fit into the album's theme, which is built around Porter's exploration of his own spiritual experience.\n\nPorter doesn't sing of God or the devil, but rather of a longing for peace, which he finds, again and again, in the power of singing. And it's that ability, more than anything else, that makes him so transcendent.\n\n<|endoftext|>\n\n\n\nFor a long time I've been a huge fan of the wedding ring with the skull and crossbones.

In today’s analysis, I’m going to look at the best first episodes of the season. Before we begin, I want to note that these rankings are based on the first episode only. It does not take into account the series as a whole. Let’s get started!\n\n10. Kiznaiver\n\nKiznaiver has a great premise: what happens when you are forced to share pain? The series opens with a car crash scene that looks like it’s going to be the whole episode, but quickly evolves into a brutal game of betrayal and pain. It’s emotionally exhausting and does a great job of laying the groundwork for what is to come.\n\n9. Joker Game\n\nThe most forgettable show on this list. The opening scene, involving a rescue operation in Germany, is visually stunning, but it’s not really what the rest of the series is about. Instead, the main characters are slowly introduced and while that’s exciting, it doesn’t really have much payoff. I would have liked more mission stuff, but I have a feeling the show is going to go the route of a slow burn. The opening, however, is brilliant.\n\n8. Boku dake ga Inai Machi\n\nRemember that movie Sliding Doors? It’s basically the same thing except it’s a dude and the scenes take place in a city. Anyway, it’s very well executed and interesting. The show also throws in some time travel stuff for good measure, but not in a way that feels obnoxious or overused.\n\n7. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu\n\nThe opening scene for this one is a conversation between two inmates at a prison in 1950s Japan. It’s incredibly effective and the best part is that it’s not even the focus of the episode. Instead, it’s used as a way to introduce the main character, Yotarou. The rest of the episode is about his time in prison and how it affected him. It’s a great story and leads perfectly into the rest of the show.\n\n6. Drifters\n\nThis is the perfect example of an anime with a good first episode. It doesn’t waste your time with long-winded introductions, instead giving you just enough backstory to understand the series. Plus, it’s just so stylish and well animated. I can’t wait to see where this show goes from here.\n\n5. Re:Zero\n\nI think what I love about this episode is that it tells the audience that they can enjoy this series even if they don’t remember the LN. It wastes no time in introducing the main character, Subaru, and his situation. He wakes up on the side of the road and gets involved in the first of many wacky shenanigans. It’s not until the end of the episode that you realize he’s somehow ended up in a video game world and that the story will likely go in a very different direction than you would have expected. The best thing about Re:Zero is that it takes the “save the cat” trope and turns it on its head, which is very refreshing.\n\n4. Bakuon!!\n\nThere’s nothing particularly special about the opening episode, other than it does a good job of introducing the characters and their bikes. The real meat of the show is in the second episode, which involves the first real story arc. It’s when the show really takes off and becomes funny and memorable.\n\n3. Orange\n\nWhat I love about this show is that it doesn’t waste any time getting to the heart of the story. It begins with the main character, Naho, hearing a letter from herself ten years in the future. She relays the message to the people around her and as the story progresses, it becomes clear what the message means. It’s also about her realizing that she has fallen in love with a boy and then learning to live with that. That is what the show is really about. It’s sweet and perfect and it only takes one episode.\n\n2. Flying Witch\n\nThis is a simple show about a witch who moves in with her cousin and starts to live a normal life. The best part is that there’s no drama involved, it’s just about a girl learning how to be normal. I think that’s why this series works. It’s just a slice of life show about a girl, so there’s no expectation that anything is going to happen. This is a show that you can watch while doing your homework or eating a bowl of ramen and that’s why it’s at number two on this list.\n\n1. Mayoiga\n\nWhat makes this the best first episode is that it absolutely destroyed my expectations. I was expecting a dull, low budget horror story and what I got was an incredible story with high stakes and brilliant cinematography. It also introduced a large number of characters, yet somehow made them all feel important and necessary. This is an amazing episode that set up a potentially great series and that’s why it’s the best of the season.\n\nAnd that’s it for this list! What shows did I miss?

When I was a kid, my family would drive down to our house on the shore, and within a half-hour, my chest would start to feel tight. As a scientist, I was surprised to find that my personal experience matched the research: The impact of air pollution on your health is immediate.\n\nThe worst effects of air pollution are known as “socioeconomic depravation,” and include asthma, allergies, heart disease, stroke, and Alzheimer’s. The worst air pollution is caused by emissions of ozone and nitrogen oxide from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass, along with particulates from dust, dirt, soot, and smoke.\n\nAbout 5.5 million people die every year from air pollution exposure, but the relationship between emissions and disease is often overlooked. We have a major health crisis here.\n\nRecently, our federal government pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, which limits the average global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nBut even if all countries met that goal, it still would not be enough. We need to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Otherwise, we’re looking at what’s called a “climate departure”—a change so severe that it will create a whole new climate system.\n\nI’m a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Southern Maine. I’m also an activist—I’ve been arrested three times for civil disobedience at the White House, to protest the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nAnd I’m doing my best to put a personal face on climate change.

In the 1990s, few were more inventive or promising than this outfit from L'Aquila, which shifted through a good many stages and styles on its demos. With this new full-length recording the band's members have demonstrated a fairly predictable slide into the darkened pit of Rock and in the process produced music that is not only not all that interesting but which is rather uninspired.

Il faut juste être un minimum compréhensif vis à vis des joueurs qui en profitent et éviter de leur hurler dessus.Après concernant les matches, c'est vrai que le système de calcul des points est inéquitable (c'est bien plus facile de gagner 5-1 que 5-4). Mais je pense qu'il y a moyen d'améliorer le système, que ce soit en fonction des régions où les équipes jouent ou d'autres paramètres (ex: tenir compte du nombre de joueurs en face ou de la valeur de leurs joueurs).Sinon dans les détails:Durant toute la phase précédente, on entend plus les joueurs de deuxième poste et troisième poste que ceux de la première, alors qu'il y a bien plus d'informations à avoir dessus (cf poste 1).Après il ne faut pas négliger la petite taille du forum. Certains joueurs sont peut-être restés pour le travail de l'equipe mais auraient été déçus de ne pas jouer. D'où le fait qu'ils se sont retirés. Je suis toujours d'avis que deuxième poste et troisième poste ne sont pas obligatoires.Mais je vais essayer d'être constructif:Je pense que tout le monde va être d'accord pour dire qu'il y a encore trop de fautes d'orthographe et de grammaire. Je trouve que pour cela, il faudrait un comité de rédaction qui vérifie les phrases avant que l'on passe les règles. On pourrait alors se concentrer sur les autres points:On pourrait aussi augmenter la taille du forum pour qu'il y ait plus de messages sur les 1ers et 3ème postes, et comme les messages qui sont postés sont validés, il n'y aurait aucun risque que des fautes d'orthographe ou de grammaire s'y glissent.J'ai encore une suggestion:En plus du calcul de points à la fin du match, on pourrait mettre une valeur (indicatif) des joueurs qu'on possède. Ainsi, si on possède 5 joueurs valant 50 de valeur, on aime 5 points de plus que si on en possède 5 vaut 40. Je pense que cela améliorerait le système de calcul des points.<|endoftext|>Introducing Refinery Provisions, A locally focused, seasonal, plant-based café & store.

The pursuit of happiness is not found in fleeting pleasures. It is not found in materialism. It is not found in security. The pursuit of happiness is found in relationship.\n\nTo gain and to keep a foothold in happiness is to engage in the highest and most significant pursuits possible. It is to become the kind of person that no matter what comes, you are happy. It is to choose your pursuits wisely, and to change them as your heart dictates.\n\nLet me give you an example. Some of you know that I grew up in a faith-based Christian household. I am very grateful for my parents, but they did not have the happiest of marriages. My dad loved my mom, but he had a very hard time respecting her. He loved us children, but he had a hard time honoring us. As I grew up, it took me a long time to realize how much pain my parents’ decisions caused each other and my brother and me. As I became an adult, I found that what I wanted most from a marriage was the ability to choose to pursue my wife’s happiness. Not just by taking her out for fancy dinners and vacations, but by being intentional in my actions toward her, even on the days that are less exciting. To be intentional about spending time with her, even when my career was more important. To listen to her even when it is inconvenient or when it will hurt my feelings. To put her needs first, even when I disagree with her, and to encourage her and celebrate her for who she is.\n\nRelationship takes effort. Relationship takes intentionality. Relationship takes humility and grace. That is why I decided that it was more important to me than a successful career or any other accomplishment. That is why I want my marriage to be the highest pursuit of my life.\n\nIf you want to know the source of true happiness, then choose your pursuits wisely. You can be an excellent Christian, a great husband, a perfect parent, an excellent leader, a talented businessperson, or any of a number of pursuits that make the world better. But unless you are pursuing your wife, and maybe your kids, with all of your heart, then you are not going to find true happiness.\n\nToday is the first day of a new year. It is a day for new beginnings. What do you want to change in your life to make it more like the life of Christ? How can you make the highest pursuit of your life the happiness of your wife and kids?\n\nFor me, this is the highest pursuit I can make. I hope you will decide to make a pursuit of your wife too.<|endoftext|>Victor Shenderovich's novel \"Democracy\" is a total satirization of the Russia of the 1990s. And it is based on a true story, when, under Gorbachev, the Bolsheviks have started a process of decomposition and part of the Soviet nomenklatura has not yet become a big oligarch. However, many of them, including the plot character of the novel - Vladimir Alexandrovich Krasnoyarsky - have not lost the hope for political career. It is just their methods and actions are becoming more and more cynical and mean. But the former youth activist Krasnoyarsky, who has now grown into a gray and stuttering man with a respectable family, \"learned to speak like the wolves and think like the wolves\", so he still has some chances to return to the \"central and powerful offices.\"\n\nHowever, the main character of the novel does not hesitate to agree on a treacherous political alliance with the former Secretary of the Regional Committee of the Komsomol Ivan Komarov and his girlfriend - Larissa Naryshkina - in order to regain his political positions and carry out his personal goals. However, a new step, \"a step up the top\", as it is called in the novel, is fraught with unexpected consequences and it threatens not only to end the life of the protagonist, but also to cast a shadow on the fate of the entire country...<|endoftext|>There is no way that in 2010 you can maintain an army of 256,000, say Britain’s best military brains.\n\nThe former head of the army Sir Richard Dannatt has called for a dramatic reduction in the size of the armed forces and warned that the budget cannot"

The problem of the age distribution of lawyers in Europe is particularly serious in Spain (only one out of five lawyers will reach retirement age), but is also a concern in France (35%), Germany (39%), Italy (42%) and the UK (45%). On the other hand, Belgium (59%), Austria (61%), Luxembourg (62%), the Netherlands (63%), Finland (64%) and Ireland (68%) are the countries where lawyers retire later.\n\nIn the past decade the situation in Europe has deteriorated as the number of lawyers over 50 has increased by more than two thirds. This situation has been described as a “cliff edge”, referring to the lack of trained successors.\n\nSome European jurisdictions are more flexible in allowing the retention of lawyers who reach retirement age. For instance, Ireland allows the practice of law even after 80 years of age. But these exceptions have not resolved the situation. On the contrary, as the number of lawyers in Europe decreases, their average age is also growing, leaving Europe with an even larger challenge in the future.\n\nAn ageing population is not the only problem that Europe’s legal profession is facing. Younger lawyers who remain in the profession after completing their training, show a high rate of inactivity (one out of four young lawyers in Europe). One of the reasons for this is that in many countries there is a lack of opportunities to practise law.\n\nTherefore, the profession needs to address these problems by improving the work-life balance and offering better opportunities for young lawyers. Otherwise, the profession will continue to experience a demographic crisis.\n\nFor further information see: http://www.blr.europa.eu/blr-vlt/database-data/lawyer-age-average-retirement-europe-european-law-family/3_entry-page/6_entry-page-tab/88_entry-page-slider/<|endoftext|>Robert Del Tredici's poem \"Who Killed Cock Robin?\" is about a dying bird that asks his friends who killed him. Every time he asks, his friends respond by saying they did not. After the second time he asks the question, the bird asks \"Who saw?\" and his friends answer that they did not see either. Then, after the bird asks \"Who will cry?\", the friends respond that they will not cry either. At the end of the poem, the bird asks \"Who will be my Valentine?\" His friends answer \"I,\" and they all fall down dead. This poem demonstrates the dangers of telling lies.<|endoftext|>It's one thing to be considered the best in the league in the NFL, but to have that prestige considered the best of all-time is a different beast.\n\nThat's the spot NFL Network analyst and Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk found himself in on Thursday.\n\nAccording to NFL.com, Faulk has been named the Greatest Show on Turf's all-time team after the Rams -- who boasted Faulk and other stars -- put together one of the best offenses in the history of the league.\n\nThe honor came at the expense of former Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, who is now a studio analyst for the network. Faulk was taken over Warner as a rusher and receiver by almost 500 yards, but also tallied almost 400 more points.\n\nSo while Warner may not have necessarily be considered better than Faulk, he certainly belongs in the discussion as one of the greatest players of his time.\n\nFaulk did lead the league in rushing touchdowns in 2000 with 24, which helped him win the rushing crown that year. But Warner also did that in 1999, and only was held off the top of the rushing charts by Faulk by six yards.\n\nFaulk and Warner have a solid history with each other and they were part of the greatest offense in NFL history when the Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000.\n\nSo while Faulk may not have been the greatest quarterback in history, he certainly deserves his place as one of the greatest players. And the greatest player of the Greatest Show on Turf has been decided.<|endoftext|>Plan B skriker ikke at jeg ønsker ham vekk, jeg vil ikke noe annet enn at han fortsetter å være venn. Det er ikke han som jeg krangler med for tiden, men noen andre. Jeg har en venn, ikke plan B, som jeg har kranglet med på et eller annet vis i nesten et år nå. Men han har faktisk aldri sagt noe negativt til meg, og han er på ingen måte egoistisk. Jeg får liksom ikke til å holde meg tilbake, men blir for sterkere og sterkere. Så lenge jeg ikke er jaloux eller skaper problemer, er det helt greit. Kanskje han er han bare glad i å konflikte?\n\nVidere er det det at han faktisk skulle være egoistisk, og ønsker jeg heller at han sier det rett ut, og ikke sier det med hundrevis av innskudd som er så personlige at de kunne vært skrevet i et privat brev. Det føles faktisk som om det blir konkurranse i alle forhold, hvor jeg vil at det skal være lett, og det er ikke ettersom han også skal passe på og gi meg denne kjærligheten, gi meg alle de positive tingene. Jeg er også egoistisk, og kjærligheten går utover min egen person, da jeg ønsker å bruke all min tid på han. Men så blir jeg også bedre og bedre på at han er glad i meg, og har lyst til å være sammen med meg.\n\nEtter mange krangler, spør han hva jeg vil han skal gjøre for å komme oss forbi dette, jeg svarer aldri at jeg ønsker at han skal gå vekk.

Stress is defined as anything that causes worry, pressure, or\n\nuneasiness. I tend to find myself in situations that are very stressful. I'm a very\n\nstressed out person in general and that only worsens when I'm under a lot of\n\nstress. During my High School days, I found myself very stressed. From having to\n\ndo homework to having tests, I was never at peace with myself. In order to deal\n\nwith stress, I usually looked for the simplest solution. I would normally turn to\n\nfast food or video games to relieve myself of stress. Sometimes, I would just\n\nkeep myself very busy by making a list of things that I needed to do or that I\n\nhad to finish that day. Sometimes, I would even make a list of all the things that\n\nI had to do the next day. Some people might find this annoying but this would help\n\nme avoid stressing. For example, I might forget to do an assignment and so I would\n\nmake a note in my agenda to make sure to do it. Another solution I had was to\n\nwrite a list of what I needed to do. If I thought of something I needed to do, I\n\nwould write it down so I would remember it. I still do this even now. Whenever I\n\nfeel that I'm too stressed, I tend to just get a lot of work done. I would even take\n\non extra assignments. Although this method may not be for everyone, it helps me\n\ndeal with stress. I would have to say that one of the most stressful times in my\n\nlife was freshman year. I was homeschooled until that year and I was very\n\nunfamiliar with the style of learning that I had to do in High School. I went from\n\na single subject school to a large High School where I had to take many classes\n\nand study for tests. When I first arrived, I wasn't ready for what I was about to\n\nexperience. I found myself being very stressed out and even though I would have\n\nhelp from my mom, it was"

He says:\n\nWhat you have described is probably just a cloud of vapour from the burnt paper. The sheet could be damp and therefore partially burnt. The candle-like effect is from the heat of the fire creating a hot updraught from the top of the paper.\n\nFire normally causes something to expand. When paper is burnt, for example, the effect is to tear it along the grain and to char the fibres. The paper may have had a chemical on it that causes the reverse to happen - shrinkage.\n\nThe shrinking is quite slow and not noticeable to you but the final result is a very sharp rip across the page. The opposite of this happens when you take a photo of someone - the flash produces heat, and this causes the water molecules in the skin to evaporate, which causes the skin to shrink.\n\nNext question: how do giant squid stay buoyant?\n\nGot a question for our experts?

After all, there are far too many examples of police officers going over the line and injuring or even killing someone for a minor, or no, infraction.\n\nStill, there are good police officers, and there are police officers who are very supportive of black people, and the president of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers is the latter.\n\nDuring a panel discussion on police brutality, Terrence Cunningham, president of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, said it was a “great policy” to disarm a police officer if he or she acts violently towards a civilian.\n\nIn this case, Cunningham was talking about a police officer who assaulted a 15-year-old teenager. The officer slammed the teenager’s head into a locker while searching him.\n\nBut Cunningham said something needs to be done.\n\n“When you talk about policy, it’s really great to have a policy that requires a certain amount of force and then requires a certain amount of reporting,” he said, according to The Washington Post.\n\n“But I think we need to go beyond that. I think we need to say that if an officer uses a certain amount of force and it is unreasonable, then I think that’s an offense that could lead to termination,” Cunningham continued.\n\nHowever, he also said something has to be done on the part of the community as well.\n\n“I think we need to address it from a policy perspective and also from a community perspective,” Cunningham said.\n\n“You have a lot of kids in the community that don’t trust law enforcement,” he said.\n\n“When they don’t trust law enforcement, they’re not going to report crime. When they don’t report crime, they don’t get reported. That’s a problem. We’ve got to work together to make people feel comfortable in reporting crime.”\n\nTelling a police officer he or she should be fired if he or she is violent against a civilian is definitely a very good policy to have. Still, the issue of trust is just as big a problem.\n\nIf black people don’t trust the police, and if police officers think they can treat anyone as they see fit because they’re not afraid of being reported, then we have a real problem.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Constitution.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n<|endoftext|>Infertility is a devastating diagnosis for any couple, but one in particular who have been through it know how difficult it can be.

To be perfectly frank, as a member of the comics media, I don’t think we do ourselves any favours with some of the reporting we do. I have long been of the opinion that the way some writers cover comics makes a complete mockery of the art form and is little better than a tabloid.\n\nSo, I thought that perhaps the passing of such an important date in the comics calendar would have been a time when mainstream media would have perhaps recognised the importance of reporting on the events in a balanced and serious manner. And indeed, for the most part, I think the mainstream media did report on it in an impartial manner.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of articles that I read in national newspapers which both fell into the same trap of making ridiculous sweeping generalisations and condescending tones, almost as if the writers were laughing at the very notion of people being interested in comics. The fact that it was in the London papers was even more strange, given that the actual festival was held in Glasgow.\n\nI’ve had enough of the ridiculous condescension and I don’t think I’m alone. So I wanted to remind all of you what the reportage should have looked like,"

The Service also fined DEP $50,000 for causing the bird’s death without a permit.\n\nThe bird was killed when a single pellet struck the eagle’s beak. The bird was in its nest at High Rocks State Park in Milford at the time of the incident. Schain said it’s unclear what the pellet was fired at, but that the department’s policy is to use the air gun to deter geese from landing in areas around parks, not to shoot them.\n\nIn March, the state paid a $1,500 fine after it was found that state Department of Transportation workers had caused the death of an eagle that struck a roadside rock pile.\n\n(Associated Press)\n\nIn other news:\n\nThieves Steal 4,000 Year Old Flint Axe Head from UK Museum\n\nA UK museum is appealing for help in tracking down a 4,000 year old axe head believed to have been stolen by thieves.\n\nThe rare Neolithic tool, which was taken from the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes, had been loaned by a collector and is of national significance.\n\nThe silver inlayed flint axe head has a hole at the top which would have fitted on to a wooden shaft. It was taken from the museum on January 5.\n\nThe museum has reported the theft to Wiltshire Police and is seeking the public’s help in recovering the axe head.\n\nChief Executive at the museum, Frank Crummy, said the axe was a rare and significant artefact and is desperate to recover it as soon as possible.\n\nHe said, “The museum would like to hear from anyone who may have seen the axe head or knows of its whereabouts.\n\n“We would urge the person who has stolen it to return it to us at the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes.”\n\nMr Crummy added that if the axe head was returned, the museum would “be happy to put it back on public display”.\n\nHe added, “We would also like to thank the Wiltshire Police for their help and advice in this matter.”\n\nA full-size replica of the axe head will be on display at the museum as part of the new Wiltshire prehistoric gallery.\n\nThe axe head has a silver inlayed head and a long hole at the top. The handle has since been replaced but the museum would like to hear from anyone who may have seen the axe or knows of its whereabouts.\n\nThe Wiltshire Museum is in Devizes and is open daily from 10am to 4.30pm and admission is free.\n\n(BBC)\n\nIn other news:\n\nFrance: 2 Sea Turtles, 1 Freshwater Turtle Seized From Paris Market\n\nPolice in Paris have discovered two endangered sea turtles and a freshwater turtle during a search of a vendor’s stand at the Porte de la Chapelle marketplace.\n\nAccording to police, the vendor said he purchased the animals in southern France, but did not know the exact source of the turtles.\n\nHe was carrying the animals in two plastic containers and was arrested on Sunday, January 15.\n\nThe vendor told police that he had purchased the turtles for approximately $120 each and hoped to sell them for $180.\n\n(Agence France Presse)<|endoftext|>Caleb Gorman to Lead GSMHA\n\n\"Caleb Gorman, who recently resigned as Mayor of Halifax Regional Municipality, has been named the new Executive Director of the Geographical Names of Nova Scotia.

It is more work than it looks, but it's soooo worth it!! This is one of my favorite fall crafts, and I do it year after year. (I've also used orange and pink!)\n\nThis is the perfect project for the kids in the house to help with! It's a great craft that they will think you spent a lot more time on than you actually did! You can make it as detailed or simple as you'd like.\n\nWhat You'll Need:\n\nJute Cord (you'll need enough to cover the entire base of the tree, and enough to weave through the sticks)\n\nCorn Starch (you'll need about 1/2 cup to cover your tree)\n\nAcrylic Paint (your choice of colors)\n\nPaint Brushes\n\nYarn\n\nNeedle\n\nHot Glue Gun\n\nWooden Twigs\n\nStart by cutting your jute cord into four-foot lengths. Once you have enough, you can tie them into bundles with a knot. (Tip: Make sure you cut it longer than you think you will need, because the size of the tree will shrink quite a bit once you put the cornstarch on it.)\n\nNext, you will need to cover the jute cord with cornstarch. Put the cornstarch in a bowl, and then dip the end of the jute cord into it. Then, use your paint brush to push the cornstarch down onto the jute cord. You may have to do this more than once, and you'll probably have to wait a few minutes for the cornstarch to dry in between coats.\n\nWhen your jute cord is covered in cornstarch, put it on a baking sheet and bake it in the oven for about 30 minutes at 150 degrees. This will dry the cornstarch and make it so you don't have to worry about water getting on your tree.\n\nOnce it is dry, you can start making your tree! Start by finding a tall jar or drinking glass. If you don't have one handy, a plastic soda bottle will do. When you have your tree trunk, tie a knot at the top and then start weaving the jute cord around it. Once it's the way you like it, tie another knot at the top to secure it in place.\n\nRepeat this process with your remaining sticks until you have as many trees as you'd like. When you're finished, attach your trees to the base of your tree using hot glue and yarn.\n\nOnce you have your tree complete, you can start decorating it. I added some fall leaves, and you could also use glitter, ornaments, etc.\n\nI'm seriously thinking about hanging my fall trees from the chandelier this year!<|endoftext|>A giant bank of fog and clouds, stretched in a plane from northeastern China to the southern Philippines, may be linked to global warming, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.\n\nAlthough the vortex, nicknamed the \"Great Pacific Blob,\" stretches far away from the equator, the fact that it also hugs the Earth's lowest point may mean that it's affected by global warming.\n\nThe blob's recent growth is consistent with observed increases in atmospheric"
"Yogapedia explains Hip-Hop\n\nHip-hop is a genre of music that became popular in the late 1970s and is associated with the hip-hop culture that evolved from DJing, MCing and breakdancing. The term hip-hop was coined in the late 1970s by Bronx DJ Afrika Bambaataa, and a few years later by hip-hop journalist and rapper Fab Five Freddy.\n\nHip-hop involves four major components: DJing, MCing, graffiti and breakdancing. The term is also used as a catch-all phrase to describe other styles of music that may not fit any other genres.\n\nMany people who were hip-hop DJs began as b-boys or breakdancers. As the genre became more commercialized in the 1980s and 1990s, the breakdancers and graffiti artists were less able to make a living from their craft and moved on to other occupations. Many popular DJs from the late 1970s and early 1980s were, or became, also graffiti artists and b-boys, including Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, Cold Crush Brothers, Tuff Crew, Roxanne Shante, Fab 5 Freddy, DJ Jazzy Jay, Cash Money, DJ Easy Lee, Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C.<|endoftext|>Fey on Fey: An Interview with Chicago’s Swiftian Comedy Troupe “Leaping Laughter”\n\nFey on Fey: An Interview with Chicago’s Swiftian Comedy Troupe “Leaping Laughter”\n\nOur very first story was a comedic one about some residents of a nursing home, “The Saga of the Teakettle of Doom,” which was about the world’s most long-suffering caretaker.

"Now and then a student will say to me, “I’m just not a numbers person.” And I think, “What does that mean?” How can someone not be a numbers person?\n\nOne could say that an artist is not a numbers person, because the whole idea of putting together all the math for the math-phobic is too much to face. The mere thought of a formula involving the product of 2 variables is enough to scare some artists off.\n\nAnother person who may not be a numbers person is the person who prefers to deal with a different language than mathematical. I’m not sure if I’m one of these people, but if I were, I’d be perfectly comfortable with a quantitative paradigm of programming. A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about a problem. Some paradigms are so different from the norm that the programmer is not using their usual way of thinking.\n\nThe paradigm I’m trying to achieve with my students is one that values beauty over time-saving, and that celebrates failure as the first step in learning something new. This paradigm includes some math, but it also has an art component, and one that is not entirely unique. I’m following in the footsteps of others who, as educators, have been far ahead of the learning curve on this one. And there is something else that makes this paradigm different, and that is that the paradigm is about the learner. My job is not to provide solutions to all of my students’ problems, but to be there to help them develop the solutions for themselves.\n\nBut before this can happen, the learner needs to get past his or her self-doubt, and start to imagine that, just maybe, it’s possible to make a difference in this world. The way to do that is by experimenting, failing, making mistakes, and moving on.<|endoftext|>Wells Fargo employees were accused of creating millions of fake accounts in order to boost sales, but a recent discovery has the bank facing additional controversy.\n\nWells Fargo employees were accused of creating millions of fake accounts in order to boost sales, but a recent discovery has the bank facing additional controversy.\n\nThe new allegations were revealed in a federal class action lawsuit against the company that also claims the firm discriminated against minorities in its mortgage lending division, The New York Times reported. The new lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in California and claims that Wells Fargo violated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against minorities in its mortgage lending division.\n\nThe lawsuit cited instances where loan officers were told to refer to African-American and Hispanic borrowers by code names, such as “mud people” and “ghetto customers,” to indicate which customers were to receive inferior service.\n\nWells Fargo spokeswoman, Mary Eshet, denied the allegations, and called them “an attempt to extract money from the company.”\n\n\"Wells Fargo disputes the claims and will contest this lawsuit vigorously,” Eshet said in an email to the Times. “The allegations are an attempt to extract money from the company by litigious means. In fact, Wells Fargo has been a leader in helping minority customers and has reached millions of homeowners in underserved communities.\"\n\nThe Justice Department in February opened a criminal investigation into whether employees at the bank broke laws when they created false accounts. The investigation, led by the U.S. attorney in Sacramento, California, was initiated after the Times reported that employees had opened roughly two million accounts without the consent of customers. The lawsuit, which was first filed in January in state court, was amended in March to include the allegations that employees discriminated against minorities.\n\nAt the center of the federal criminal investigation are Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of Wells Fargo's community banking division, and other high-ranking executives. Employees were forced to meet internal sales quotas or face firing. Many said they were ordered to “pry into customers’ lives,” to boost sales. When employees failed to meet their sales targets, they were threatened with termination.\n\nA group of workers also filed a lawsuit against the company in state court in Utah in February, claiming that they were fired or forced to resign for refusing to participate in the alleged illegal activity.\n\nWells Fargo has been under scrutiny since the Los Angeles Times first reported the illegal sales practices in September. The bank has since apologized for the conduct of its employees, and said the bank’s top leadership was unaware of the misconduct. The bank reached a $185 million settlement with regulators in September, and fired about 5,300 employees, including Tolstedt.\n\nWells Fargo has since announced several policy changes to reform its sales practices and will create a board committee to oversee the changes. The committee will be led by Elizabeth Duke, a former member of the Federal Reserve, and Sherry Hunt, the bank’s former chief financial officer.\n\nThe Justice Department did not comment on the new lawsuit, but spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman told the Times that the department takes discrimination allegations seriously.\n\n“The department takes fair lending allegations very seriously,” she said.<|endoftext|>I\n\ndon't get it.\n\n\n\n\n\nis everything these guys touch...\n\na new invention?\n\na revolutionary process?\n\non the cutting edge?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first started using liquid eyeliners a few years ago I thought,\n\nthey look good...\n\nthey look like they'd be fun to play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd,\n\ndang,\n\nthese pencils are kind of expensive...\n\n\n\n\n\nI think they may be well worth the money.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\nthe lady who taught my eyeshadow class at Ulta did recommend the following liquid eyeliners:\n\n(she did not recommend them to me personally - just to class members in general)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been using the NYX and Essence eyeliners.\n\nNYX for a while now.\n\nThis is a good one.\n\nEssence - the new one.\n\nThe applicator is much easier to work with.\n\nAnd this one is super black.\n\nI still can't get my line to look as good as it does on the Ulta lady -\n\nbut I'm practicing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's an in-your-face look:\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm also playing with a new look...\n\none with a slight wing.\n\nIt's easier to wear than it is to do,\n\nand it takes a long time to get it right.\n\nBut it's not rocket science.\n\nAnd it's fun.\n\nI guess I need to work on my penmanship.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\n\n\n\nDana<|endoftext|>For in the great City into which I had just come the men pay no attention to women, but, seeing that beauty is free to all who care to pay for it, direct all their efforts towards keeping themselves as handsome as possible.\n\nSuch was his philosophy, and such was his practice. It must be admitted that the latter was consistent with the former, and that, whilst his follies were of the most extravagant character, he gave proof of a high degree of ability, and of a very decided will.\n\nBut it is not my intention to defend him, nor to excuse him. His life and his actions would, in themselves, furnish forth a romance, of which the life of the Marquis de Sade would furnish the dreary groundwork, and of which his own romance, entitled Justine, would furnish the dreary development.\n\nNo, no; I have no intention of presenting him to you in the light of a reformer, or of a philanthropist, or of a philosopher; he was a sensualist, a dastardly rascal, a debauchee, a liar, a cheat, a scoundrel.\n\nFor these and for other reasons, and also, perhaps, for the more foolish one that the Marquis de Sade has never been condemned, I have no intention of describing his life to you; I propose, rather, to deal with the thoughts which occupied his mind, with the rules which he laid down for himself, and with the singular and extraordinary notions which led to his strange mode of life, and which, perhaps, also, partly influenced his criminal and immoral conduct.\n\nMy task is a difficult one; I must be more exact than the attorney who defends, or than the advocate who prosecutes; and, whilst anxious to do justice to my subject, I must not overlook any of the circumstances of his life.\n\nMy subject is an interesting one; but it is very grave. It would be easy to make of it a mere romantic novel, and to do so without making it less interesting. I should require only a few touches of paint, and I should thus complete my task. But that would be to do an injustice to my subject, and to treat it lightly.

In fact, the hype behind the TUF finale pales in comparison to that of the rematch between Jones and Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 165.\n\nAnd yet, what we saw at UFC 165 was not much of a fight. It was one of the most one-sided bouts we've seen in the UFC in quite some time. It was so one-sided that you may wonder how anyone in their right mind would even consider this a rematch.\n\nThe great thing about the sport of MMA is that there's always room for redemption. If you have a bad fight, you can always fight again. It's the fight game and you're going to get beat. The question is whether you come back stronger than before, or if you let your confidence be shaken and spiral down into the abyss.\n\nWith that said, here are the five things we've learned from the first fight between Jon Jones and Alexander Gustafsson.\n\n1. Jon Jones is the King of the Light Heavyweights\n\nIt was never really in doubt, but Jones' domination at UFC 165 reminded the MMA world that he is the number one light heavyweight in the world.\n\nGustafsson had Jones in trouble in the first round, but since then, the champ hasn't even broken a sweat. He did it with an efficient takedown game and a brutal top game.\n\nGustafsson is the one fighter that seems to be able to at least hang with Jones, but he didn't come anywhere close to taking the champ out. He couldn't take him down and he couldn't even score a takedown of his own.\n\nThe main question now is whether Jones can deal with Alexander Gustafsson's size. Gustafsson is the tallest fighter Jones has ever faced, and if he can handle that length and that reach, he could very well be unstoppable.\n\n2. Jones doesn't respect Gustafsson\n\nThe one thing you want to see from a champion is that he takes the guy he's fighting seriously. He has to, because the moment he takes his opponent for granted, the guy could end up shocking him.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn't the case at UFC 165. The entire fight, Jones fought as if he was just doing enough to win. He didn't even bother to engage in a little trash talk. And his disrespectful attitude afterward was more of the same.\n\nI get that he's the champ and he's not going to go overboard and lose his cool, but he should at least act like his opponent is dangerous and is not just a stepping stone for him.\n\nIf Gustafsson is ever going to get a rematch, he has to prove that he's the real deal. It will take a dominant win over the next opponent and a display of humility on his part, but a win over Glover Teixeira could be just what he needs.\n\n3. Size matters\n\nWhen it was announced that Jones and Gustafsson would have their rematch, most MMA fans were excited because we all knew it would be another great fight.\n\nWhat many of us did not expect, however, was how the fight would end up going. Most people expected a lot of striking between the two and to see who could best one another with the fewest amount of mistakes.\n\nThat is not what we got. Jones took Gustafsson down time and time again, and it was clear that the Swede was no match for the size of the champ.\n\nAlthough it's hard to say what would have happened if Gustafsson had been able to keep the fight standing, it's still not a very comforting thought to know that Gustafsson was outmatched by Jones in the grappling department.\n\n4. Jon Jones has some improvements to make\n\nThe first fight between Jones and Gustafsson was absolutely incredible and a lot of people would say that Jones was the clear-cut winner.\n\nI am not one of those people. Yes, Jones controlled the fight, but he wasn't as dominant as we all thought. Gustafsson had Jones in trouble in the first round and that is not something we see often with Jones.\n\nGustafsson has an incredible reach advantage, but that doesn't necessarily mean he will be able to hit Jones with his punches. After all, Gustafsson could not land a single significant punch and his best punch of the fight was a glancing blow.\n\nIf Gustafsson can hit Jones with his jab, he may have a chance, but he has to catch him first and that's a problem because Jones is incredibly fast. If he can put Jones on his back, however, he will most likely get the decision.\n\nIf there's one thing Jones has to work on, it's his takedown defense. It's not that he doesn't work on it because he does, but he needs to focus more on it.\n\n5. There are a lot of different ways to beat Jones\n\nI'm sure that most fans are excited for the possible rematch between Jones and Gustafsson, but even if Jones loses to Glover Teixeira, there are still a lot of options left for challengers.\n\nSome would say that Phil Davis could be a good opponent, but the reason that fight doesn't excite me is because Jones would simply take Davis down and it would be a one-sided beatdown.\n\nThen, there's Alexander Gustafsson, who I already mentioned and who has a good chance of beating Jones if he can figure out how to land his punches.\n\nAlthough that's a long shot, there are a few other fighters who could potentially beat Jones in the future. Antonio Rogerio Nogueira and Mauricio Rua are on the list as well as Glover Teixeira.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, it feels like the light heavyweight division has new life.\n\nThanks for reading, you can follow me on Twitter @RileyLittle.\n\nStay tuned right here at MMA Sucka for more live streams as well as videos highlighting the top fighters, commentators, coaches, promoters and other names in MMA and combat sports.

Chargers, it can be easy to forget about the rest of the AFC West. The division could be one of the most competitive in the NFL this season. The Chargers have been one of the more competitive teams for the past decade, the Chiefs and Raiders have shown that they have talent on their teams and the Broncos should still be one of the best teams in the league.\n\nBut with all that said, here are my predictions for the AFC West this season.\n\nDenver Broncos (11-5)\n\nThe Broncos are the defending Super Bowl Champions, so they have that going for them. They also return almost all of the players who made them a top offense and defense. Case Keenum is back and while he had a fantastic season last year, he is a streaky quarterback and can have some cold spells.\n\nThe Broncos have a tough schedule and some injuries can make this team vulnerable. But, it should be enough to get them to the playoffs and potentially another Super Bowl appearance.\n\nKansas City Chiefs (10-6)\n\nThe Chiefs are the team in the division with the most questions. After losing several defensive stars to free agency, the defense is going to have to improve. The offense is lead by an explosive group of skill position players, but the defense could still be a liability.\n\nThe Chiefs play a tough schedule this season, so the defense will have to show improvement. If the Chiefs have a down year, the Chargers will be there to take the division.\n\nOakland Raiders (9-7)\n\nThe Raiders had a huge turnaround last season after going from a team with little hope to a team with some momentum. They have an explosive offense and a good defense. However, they still have some of the same problems they’ve had the past few years.\n\nThey still have issues protecting Derek Carr. Carr can make the big plays to score, but if the offensive line doesn’t improve, the Raiders could see themselves under .500. The Raiders have the potential to be one of the best teams in the league, but I think they will have another so-so year.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (8-8)\n\nThe Chargers will be good this year. The problem is, it won’t be enough. While the Chargers have an improved offense and a good defense, they have some tough losses in the division. The Chargers also play a tough schedule, which will lead to some tough games.\n\nThe Chargers have the potential to make some noise this year, but they will have to take a few wins from the Chiefs and Raiders.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\n<|endoftext|>Posted 16 March 2017 - 10:11 PM\n\nI found this match on youtube but I can't find it anywhere else on the internet.

Its perceptive and experienced editors keep a sharp eye on world events and provide insightful analysis on issues of U.S. and international concern. In our Web Focus series, the Monitor’s editors weigh in on timely topics with extended essays meant to take a broad look at the forces shaping our world.\n\nWhat’s a “cyber-9/11”? A cyberattack on a nuclear facility or a major dam that could release enough water to drown a major American city? A digital assault on the nation’s banking system or a threat to the electrical grid that could plunge millions of Americans into darkness? The recent warnings from Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Agency director, Gen. Keith Alexander, suggest that such nightmare scenarios are indeed a possibility.\n\nBut if U.S. intelligence officials are to be believed, the greatest threat is an assault on the nation’s financial institutions. After Dempsey warned Congress that the U.S. could “see cyber incidents that have physical effects on our critical infrastructure,” Alexander echoed his remarks by noting, “A cyberattack that could have physical effects, that is the greatest fear.”\n\nThe consensus is that a catastrophic cyberattack could wreak havoc on the U.S. economy. The reality, however, is far more complex and nuanced.\n\nDespite claims of major foreign-government backing for a digital assault on American banks, the truth is that such an operation is very unlikely. In recent years, foreign cyberintelligence agencies have tried to collect sensitive information about banks, including the names and Social Security numbers of their customers. A similar campaign targeting American credit-card companies in 2011 was likely perpetrated by the Syrian Electronic Army, a group of hackers supporting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This operation was relatively easy and inexpensive to conduct.\n\nThe reality is that America’s banking system is highly resilient. Even after the catastrophic events of 2008, when hundreds of small and medium-sized banks failed, the country’s largest institutions emerged from the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis in better shape than ever.\n\nThe system as a whole remains sound and is well capitalized. America’s banks remain the best-run financial institutions in the world.\n\nAnother myth is that a digital assault on U.S. banks could cause financial panic. Such claims are hyperbolic. Bank customers in this country have ready access to digital accounts, and those who rely on more traditional methods, such as a teller, are quickly switching to digital channels as well.\n\nA cyberattack on America’s banking system might undermine confidence in the safety of its networks, but there is little to indicate that customers would take their money out of banks in a large-scale panic. In 2011, when many U.S. banks suffered from a series of hacking attacks, there was no bank run. The attacks caused brief hiccups in the banking system but no lasting harm.\n\nThe threat that’s garnering the most attention these days is an attack on the U.S. financial system from a foreign power. In 2010, the New York Times reported that China had hacked into the computers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the FBI arrested several suspects who were working at JPMorgan Chase and at least one other bank.\n\nIn response, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security launched an initiative to secure the American financial system from foreign-government attacks.\n\nThe odds of a major cyberattack from China or Russia are far less likely than most people believe. An American bank has little to gain from being penetrated by hackers. Both countries have thriving black markets in information that could be sold to interested parties, and the purchase price would be higher than the cost of a sophisticated cyberattack.\n\nThe most plausible threat is a “disruptive” attack that, as Gen. Alexander put it, “isn’t to crash the system but to interrupt it in some way, to make people aware that the system isn’t safe.” Such an operation could easily come from a criminal hacker or foreign-government operatives. An attack that exposed confidential information would shake consumer confidence, but there is little"

He encourages them to continue in the service of the Lord despite the difficulties and dangers they face. These were the Israelites who left the safety and prosperity of Egypt for the uncertainties of Canaan. Their task was to displace the wicked Canaanites who occupied the land. This was no easy task, and many a valiant warrior fell in the struggle. Still the Lord promised to go before the Israelites and help them defeat the Canaanites and claim the land for their own.\n\nGod had promised to go before the Israelites. This is a familiar theme in the Old Testament. But it is also a familiar theme in the New Testament. Paul told the Hebrew believers in Rome, “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:” (Romans 5:12). In this statement Paul used two Old Testament examples to illustrate the extent of the power of sin to destroy life. First he noted that the life-giving properties of the soil were destroyed when Adam sinned. In the garden of Eden the ground had yielded to Adam and Eve fruits and nuts of every kind, but after the fall man was forced to work hard for his sustenance. Then Paul cited the most recent Old Testament example: “For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves” (Romans 2:14). The Lord had promised to go before the Israelites to help them drive out the Canaanites from the land of promise. After Adam’s fall God said to the serpent, “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel” (Genesis 3:15). The serpent’s head was bruised when Christ died for the sins of all men, but the serpent’s head would ultimately be bruised by the Messiah’s heel.\n\nAt the end of the Old Testament era God had to rescue His people Israel from a most perilous situation. The ten northern tribes had refused to obey God’s commands and had rejected His prophets. Because of their sins God allowed Israel to be conquered by the Assyrian army and taken into exile. The Judahites and Benjaminites were spared destruction, but Judah was brought to the brink of extinction. God sent prophets to warn the Israelites of their imminent destruction, but they would not listen to the prophets. In spite of these disasters the Lord promised to go before His people to help them drive out the Canaanites from the land of promise.\n\nThe Israelites under Joshua drove out the Canaanites and occupied their land. But the Israelites were destined to live in a hostile world. The Canaanites had been their neighbors in Egypt. In the land of Canaan they were surrounded by nations hostile to the God of Israel.\n\nIn the life of the New Testament believer there are the same difficulties and dangers. It was never the purpose of God to give His children an easy life in this world. In fact, the Bible says, “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him” (James 1:12). We must not be surprised by the temptations and trials that are part of the Christian life. “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth” (Hebrews 12:6). The Lord’s chastisements are part of His discipline, and His purpose in chastening us is not to destroy us but to bring us to maturity.\n\nHow do we endure these trials and temptations? We endure by remembering that we are engaged in the battle of the Lord. It is not our strength that carries us through, but the Lord Himself. “For the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee” (Deuteronomy 31:6).\n\nIs it easy to trust the Lord with all my cares and burdens? No, it is not easy to trust the Lord with the details of my life, but it is necessary. If we do not trust Him to be our guide, our protector, our helper, our comforter, we cannot live a godly life. We have to trust Him, but we have to do more than that. We have to walk by faith, not by sight. This is not easy to do. There are times when it is very difficult to trust the Lord in the midst of great troubles. We have to take a stand of faith and put our trust in the Lord in the midst of overwhelming trials and temptations. This is the only way to have victory over our enemies and the enemies of the Lord. “Be strong, and of good courage; fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee” (Deuteronomy 31:6).\n\nGod’s promise to go before the Israelites was a promise of victory over the enemies of Israel, and the same promise is made to every believer. God wants His people to know that He will help them overcome every obstacle in the Christian life. The greatest promise that God makes to His people is that He will not forsake them. This promise applies not only to our trials and temptations, but also to our sins and the temptations of Satan. “For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ” (I Thessalonians 5:9). The word “appoint” means to arrange beforehand. It is in the Lord’s providential plan that we are to obtain salvation, and He will arrange for us to have that salvation. The word “wrath” means a dreadful passion. The Lord has not planned for us to experience His dreadful anger. He has planned that we should live in the love and grace of His own presence. The Holy Spirit comes to live in our hearts and abide with us forever. In His own time He will gather us to be with Him forever in heaven. But until that time comes He will abide with us and go before us to help us overcome the enemies of our souls. He will not forsake us.<|endoftext|>美國人的亂倫,午夜性開放午夜性影院,自拍内射視頻 精品自拍内射視頻 性愛,聯想a3800dpi,被老公的上司幹很兇,男人的條件電影男人的棒棒插女人的屁股視頻。觀看小紅帽資源觀看小說桃色迷情,佛山桑拿服務論壇,男人看的網站你懂的,居家自拍國産,潮人特色漫畫,"

He's a type A personality and is very good with working things out.\n\n\"He'd ask me 'do you think you're going to get a job soon?' and I'd say 'I don't know, hopefully'.\n\n\"I'd start to get anxious about it and I wouldn't want to talk about it because I didn't want to bring him down.\"\n\nWhen Susanne was looking for jobs, she wanted to take the job in Melbourne as it was closer to her partner's family.\n\nHer partner agreed, and as they were living with his parents in their country home at the time, he went to Melbourne to work while Susanne remained in Brisbane.\n\nBut after some time, the couple started to feel it was the wrong decision.\n\n\"When he went to Melbourne, he just kept working and working, and he's such a hard worker and he would just keep working all day and all night,\" Susanne said.\n\n\"He didn't really like Melbourne either, it's a hard place.\n\n\"He was on his own there and he got very lonely and missed his family and I didn't want to go down to Melbourne because I thought I wouldn't see him as much, so we decided to move to the Gold Coast.\"\n\nBut with a baby on the way, Susanne said she feels like she is going to be moving around a lot in the next two years.\n\n\"It's pretty hard to have a baby when you're living with your parents and it's just me and him, and when we move into our own house, I don't know how we'll manage,\" she said.\n\n\"It's been really hard and he's been stressed and anxious a lot.\n\n\"He used to be the one who said everything would be OK, but now he just worries about everything.\"\n\nAfter becoming pregnant, Susanne said her partner had a lot of problems with their financial situation.\n\n\"He said 'I'm really worried about our finances' and I said 'it's fine, we'll be alright',\" she said.\n\n\"But he got a bit anxious and it started to rub off on me.\n\n\"We would talk about money a lot, and he would go to his parents and get a lot of advice.\n\n\"I didn't really mind talking about it and he would get stressed about it, but I'm the type of person who doesn't really care.\"\n\nSusanne said she would find her partner on the phone to his mum \"constantly\", and he would get more and more anxious about things.\n\n\"It really started to affect me and it was hard,\" she said.\n\n\"He didn't say 'sorry I'm a bit stressed' or 'I need some time to myself' - he would just carry on.\n\n\"When I was pregnant, I had a really hard time because I was pregnant and it was hard to do things, and I didn't want to be"
"An industrial materials company based in Missouri has agreed to pay a $200,000 penalty to resolve allegations that it violated the Clean Water Act and an associated Consent Decree. Alkali Specialties LLC, a subsidiary of the Louisiana-based Alkali Specialties Group, entered into the settlement agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe settlement agreement states that Alkali Specialties did not properly manage hazardous wastes generated from the company’s glass manufacturing operations, as agreed upon in a 2008 Consent Decree. The violations include failure to properly characterize and treat wastewater and contamination of water supplies and fish in two states. In one case, the company dumped wastewater from a high pressure alkaline cleaning process into a manhole, which drained into a stormwater ditch that fed into a drainage ditch connected to a local stream. EPA’s investigation discovered fish die-offs and contamination of the local water supply.\n\n“Properly treating industrial wastewater is not optional,” said EPA Regional Administrator Shawn M. Garvin. “The owners and operators of Alkali Specialties could have avoided these serious violations by having good management practices in place to make sure that wastewater containing hazardous chemicals was safely and properly treated.”\n\nThe company is required to have an EPA-approved management plan in place to ensure proper treatment of the company’s wastewater. A list of the company’s manufacturing activities and associated wastewater characteristics must also be included in the plan. The company also must pay a $5,000 civil penalty.\n\nThe Consent Decree requires Alkali Specialties to treat wastewater generated by its glass manufacturing processes through a municipal wastewater treatment system or industrial wastewater treatment system. The company is required to install monitoring devices and submit reports that track how the company is meeting the Decree’s requirements.\n\nAlkali Specialties operates glass manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, Missouri, and Virginia.<|endoftext|>I was only around 4 or 5, so I was not old enough to ride alone, and this is one of the only pictures of me with my dad. He always liked his motorcycle, but I am sure he would be even more thrilled with his daughter riding around.\n\nSometimes when I am out on my motorcycle, people ask me how I got into it. It is not something that I started from an early age. I actually have not ridden a motorcycle for more than a few years, but I have always had a soft spot in my heart for them.\n\nI was only around 4 or 5, so I was not old enough to ride alone, and this is one of the only pictures of me with my dad. He always liked his motorcycle, but I am sure he would be even more thrilled with his daughter riding around.\n\nHe always had a motorcycle on the side. This is another picture of my dad and me when I was very little. We used to ride on his motorcycle with him on the back, and me in front with my head over the seat. I could always feel him riding around with me, and he always made me feel so secure. He was always a very good father. I would love to have more time with him.\n\nThat was what motorcycles were for him. He never had time to go off on a road trip or anything like that, but he loved the feeling of riding.\n\nHe always rode a Yamaha, but he never wanted anything too fancy. He always said that they were built so strong, and that you didn’t need all of the other features to have a great ride. He said that they were built well and would last for a long time.\n\nI always wanted to get one, but I never had enough money. He was always happy to teach me how to ride, but he also wanted to be there with me. I still get on the back of my boyfriend’s bike, and I feel like I am with him.\n\nMy dad had a terrible accident on his motorcycle, and he was taken to the hospital where he was on the road to recovery. He had a broken leg, which led to some complications that he could not overcome. He passed away a few days later, and he was only 52 years old.\n\nWe all had a lot of great memories together, and I am sure he would be so happy that I now own a motorcycle. I don’t go out on long trips, but I love riding my motorcycle around town. I am sure he would be thrilled that I am out and about on my own motorcycle.<|endoftext|>Sign up to be notified and we’ll send you an email when this product is back in stock.\n\nNotify Me\n\nFrom Stussy, a zip hoodie with a full zip front closure.

"At the moment, one of the biggest news in the cryptocurrency world is that EOS (EOS) blockchain is going live on June 1st. This is of course great news, but is it enough to attract investors and businesses to this new project?\n\nHere are five things you need to know about EOS.\n\n1. The EOS is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap\n\nRight now, EOS is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the world with a total market cap of over 14 billion dollars. You will also find out that this is way behind of the biggest one – bitcoin, with almost $250 billion total market cap.\n\n2. EOS is a platform, not a token\n\nAs mentioned above, EOS is not a token – it is a platform that allows developers to create apps on the EOS blockchain. While this may sound strange to some people, you can easily see the reasoning behind this.\n\nWith EOS, all dApps on the platform will work with each other in order to create a better end-user experience. EOS is also designed to provide the possibility for the new developers to launch their applications in a few minutes, without having to write any code.\n\nEOS has a great potential because its founders are already the creators of one of the most popular crypto platforms – Block.one, which also made a lot of money from its $4 billion token sale last year.\n\n3. EOS wants to become a better Ethereum\n\nMany people claim that EOS wants to become a better version of Ethereum. They are also looking to become the most powerful infrastructure for dApp developers, and they are also targeting some of the biggest industries like social media, finance, supply chain, healthcare, and others.\n\n4. EOS launched its first dApp called ‘Plebs’\n\nOne of the first dApps that will launch on the EOS platform is called “Plebs”. This is a social network for blockchain enthusiasts and cryptocurrency traders. The first thing that you will notice when you log in is the “cryptocurrency wallet” button that will allow users to trade all sorts of tokens on the platform.\n\n5. EOS’ token distribution was one of the biggest in history\n\nEOS managed to raise almost $4 billion from its token distribution event back in 2017. For comparison, the second biggest crowd sale was for Ethereum, which managed to raise $18 million in the same year.\n\nWhile EOS has an interesting approach and has a good team, the launch of EOS MainNet will determine whether this project will succeed or not. The first version of EOS MainNet is expected to go live on June 1st, 2018.\n\nWe will be updating our subscribers as soon as we know more.

Who's to blame?\n\nToday at a San Diego Comic-Con panel, Marvel made some pretty big announcements about its Inhumans franchise, including a major change for the show.\n\nThe ABC series will no longer be a TV show, but a limited series of movies that will hit theaters first, and then air on TV.\n\nMarvel Studios president Kevin Feige was joined on stage by Jeph Loeb, head of Marvel Television. Feige took the blame for this change, admitting that the show had changed since its inception.\n\nMarvel TV and Film Are Now One \"Unified Narrative\" in the MCU 10+ IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 13 Marvel's Inhumans star Anson Mount in Marvel's Inhumans: \"For years, comic book fans wanted Marvel to bring the Inhumans to the screen, but it wasn't until I joined the Marvel family that I realized the caliber of their anticipation.\" 01 OF 13 Marvel's Inhumans star Anson Mount in Marvel's Inhumans: \"For years, comic book fans wanted Marvel to bring the Inhumans to the screen, but it wasn't until I joined the Marvel family that I realized the caliber of their anticipation.\" Marvel TV and Film Are Now One \"Unified Narrative\" in the MCU Download Image Captions ESC\n\nLoeb explained that as the show was being developed, it morphed into something quite different than what they had intended. That's when they decided to rework it into a movie, which will have its own narrative, but will also be tied to the bigger Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loeb and Feige stressed that the show is a completely different property from the movies, but that they do want to see it connect.\n\nAs a result of this change, the pilot of the show, which was already shot, will not be used. So, what was shot?\n\nMarvel's Inhumans: All Character Images 8 IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 08 Black Bolt (Anson Mount) in Marvel's Inhumans 01 OF 08 Black Bolt (Anson Mount) in Marvel's Inhumans Marvel's Inhumans: All Character Images ABC Download Image Captions ESC\n\nThe new version of the show will debut in theaters, but after that, it will move to ABC. It will run for eight episodes, which will then air in a two-hour TV event. The eight-episode run will be followed by the first two episodes of The Inhumans television show, which will then air weekly on ABC. It's unclear if the subsequent six episodes will debut exclusively on the TV show, or in theaters before TV.\n\nAll eight episodes will be made available on the same day for viewers who want to watch on TV. The show will debut on Imax for two weeks.\n\nSo what does this mean for the characters who are set to appear on the show? Black Bolt and Medusa will definitely appear, but they won't be played by Anson Mount and Serinda Swan. Marvel did not announce who will take over the roles of the two leaders of the Inhuman Royal Family.\n\nOn the other hand, Maximus the Mad will be portrayed by Iwan Rheon (Game of Thrones), who's replacing Ken Leung. He was shown on the big screen at the panel.\n\nShowrunner Scott Buck, who's also worked on Iron Fist, is sticking around for the reworked version of the show.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nThe panel also announced several new cast members for the Inhumans movie, including:\n\nEllen Woglom will play an unidentified character.\n\nwill play an unidentified character. She's joined by Sonya Balmores , who will play Auran .\n\n, who will play . Mike Moh will play Triton , the Royal Family's cousin.\n\nwill play , the Royal Family's cousin.

The last casting is of a young boy named Dante , who will be played by newcomer Emilio Kelevra .\n\n, who will be played by newcomer . That leaves Lockjaw, who is being played by an animatronic dog, the movement of which was demoed on the stage.\n\nThe Inhumans will debut in theaters on September 1, 2019. The first two episodes will debut on ABC after that, before the rest of the series will continue on the network.\n\nFor more on the Marvel Cinematic Universe, here's what the studio's TV shows are coming between now and 2021.<|endoftext|>I have come to accept a sad truth: Apple's Safari browser, and to a lesser extent the Mac operating system, does not work with some of my websites.

Originally a summer school, it was established by a small group of craftspeople including George Elbert Burr, Ernest N.

One of the nice things about this small, tightly-controlled island is that the government keeps the population contained in small, well-defined areas, or “estates”. And if you know anything about me, you know I love it when things are tightly controlled. But the trouble is that most of the estates are quite old and, therefore, cramped. So Singapore is often ranked near the top in the dubious “quality of living” lists. But it’s a small price to pay for the island’s many other virtues. And like I said, Singaporeans know what they are doing.\n\nOne thing that they have done is devise the wonderfully named “queue jump lanes” for the MRT (subway). And the way that it works is simple: instead of everyone using a bunch of doors to get on and off the train, the doors are grouped by destination and one door in each group is for the “queue jump” lane. The “jumpers” simply get in line to board the train at a set of doors that they are waiting at and if enough people are waiting behind them (they have to be at least three or four), then the train doors open for them and they can board the train.\n\nBut what makes this so great is that the MRT station doesn’t really have any huge lines. Everyone is in the same line to board the train and it works very efficiently. And because the commuters are all in the same line, the stations don’t get too crowded and everyone gets on and off the train quickly. And it’s such a simple, elegant solution to the age-old problem of waiting in line to board a train. But it has to be done in a very organized manner or it will not work. And Singaporeans are good at organizing things. And they are good at following instructions. So it works.\n\nThis is why Singaporean officials now have big plans to clean up the Internet in their island state. They are just following orders. You see, Singapore is a clean and neat place, like an apartment or a house. And it’s a small island with lots of people. And if you have people living together and living closely together, you will have problems with things like personal space, personal hygiene and cleanliness. And Singapore has rules for these things, just like any other well-ordered and tidy city. And because of these rules, it is a good place to live. And the Internet is a wild and wooly place that needs to be tamed.\n\nThe government has already started to act against sites with porn and gambling. But the new, bold and determined, Internet-cleanup effort has begun. The effort will tackle sites that “advocate homosexuality, obscenity, violence, terrorism or any other illicit activities.” And with those loose guidelines, I’m sure the government will be able to take down all sorts of sites. But Singapore is a good place to live and it should be a good place to surf.\n\nI’ve spent the last few years cleaning up the sites I have on the Internet, as well as cleaning up myself. I’ve stopped going to a therapist because I feel good. I’ve stopped going to AA meetings because I’m no longer an alcoholic. And I’ve stopped going to NA meetings because I’m no longer a drug addict. And now I’m sure that I will never be at a gambling site again because I’m no longer a gambler. And I’m sure that I will never see any sites with porn, but that’s just because I’m too lazy to look for it.\n\nAnd I’m not advocating that people with any of those problems should try to change. Those things are just the bad in my life. But I know that I am on the right track and I am making progress. And I have not been to a therapist in two months and I have not been to an AA meeting in over three months. And I have not been to a NA meeting in more than a year. And I am clean and I feel great.\n\nI think that I’ll be getting to bed early tonight. It’s been a big day.<|endoftext|>Réponse de janelle :\n\nCayman's thank you for the great review, and sorry you were confused with the check in time.

Lee, she said, had the room bursting into laughter when she saw him reading the scene with her.\n\nSo does that mean Lee was doing his performance all wrong? Hey answered the question by saying \"I don't think that I could have ever come close to him.\"\n\nSo, what does she think of the Star Wars prequels?\n\n\"They're well made, they're great films,\" she said, adding that \"the first film is the one that always comes up when I'm talking about the movies.\"\n\nHey's Aussie accent probably didn't help her chances of being cast in the role of Padmé.\n\nAs far as what fans thought of the prequels, Hey said she was never really sure because, \"I wasn't in them.\"\n\nImage courtesy Virginian Hey.<|endoftext|>The video will start in 8 Cancel\n\nGet daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nHarry Redknapp has revealed the players that former Birmingham City manager Harry Redknapp wanted to sign for Queens Park Rangers during his time in charge of the club.\n\nThe 70-year-old was only in charge at Loftus Road for the 2013-14 season and in that time he managed to take the club to promotion to the Premier League.\n\nIn that time he worked alongside the likes of Joey Barton, Rio Ferdinand and Joey \"Cinderella Man\" Barton, who all played a role in helping the club to promotion.\n\nBut he also had a massive say in which players he wanted to sign during his time with the club.\n\nSpeaking in a Q&A with The Sun , Redknapp was asked which players he wanted to sign for the club and revealed that he wanted to bring in a number of players, including Spurs forward Harry Kane.\n\n(Image: Paul Gilham/Getty Images)\n\n\"We wanted to sign the Spurs kid [Harry] Kane but he was injured,\" Redknapp said.\n\nRedknapp added that he had the chance to sign Neymar from his spell with Paris Saint-Germain and also tried to bring in Luis Suarez from Liverpool.\n\nRedknapp was a guest on Sky's Sunday Supplement this morning, where he spoke about what it was like working with Ferdinand.\n\n(Image: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images)\n\nHe said: \"What a player he was.

"British and U.S. officials this week agreed on a plan to halt Iran’s nuclear program by using sanctions and diplomacy, the Times of London reported, citing unnamed senior U.S. officials.\n\nThe plan, which could be implemented in a matter of weeks, will include a dramatic increase in financial sanctions, together with covert sabotage and military action, the newspaper reported, without giving details.\n\nIn Washington, the State Department said it had no comment on the report.\n\nOfficials from both countries are to meet again this week in Washington to discuss further plans, the newspaper said.\n\nThe newspaper, citing unnamed officials, said the new plan would impose a package of sanctions which could see the European Union ban the import of Iranian oil.\n\n“If we have the sanctions come together, then we will be ready to move quickly,” the Times quoted one of the U.S. officials as saying.\n\nU.S. officials said the new plan would incorporate measures drawn up by Israel, which has also urged more sanctions, the newspaper said.\n\nThe Israeli officials told U.S. counterparts they were concerned about the credibility of any sanctions imposed as a result of a plan agreed by the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — but not by other states, the Times said.\n\nThe new plan calls for “the credible threat of military force against the Iranian nuclear program,” it said.\n\nThe plan, drawn up by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, calls for targeted assassinations and for stepping up cyber attacks, it said.\n\nBut the newspaper quoted U.S. officials as saying that even these were unlikely to be effective in stopping Iran’s nuclear program, unless they were accompanied by severe sanctions.\n\nThe United States and its European allies have made several attempts to persuade Iran to stop its uranium enrichment program, which they believe aims to produce nuclear weapons, but Tehran has repeatedly refused.\n\nIran denies the charge, insisting its program is purely civilian.\n\n(Photo: Reuters)<|endoftext|>by Kilian Melloy\n\nTuesday Sep 7, 2012\n\nIn a reversal of the \"lesbian bed death\" myth, a recent study has found that long-term lesbian relationships -- like heterosexual ones -- are not characterized by a \"slow erosion\" of sexual desire, as long as the women feel satisfied with their relationships.\n\nLesbian couples who reported feeling satisfied with their relationships were as likely to report having sex as often as heterosexual couples, the study showed, LiveScience reported on Aug. 29.\n\nThe findings reversed the notion that women in same-sex relationships are less likely to experience the \"sexual boredom\" that supposedly characterizes relationships between women, according to LiveScience.\n\n\"Sexual frequency was similar for heterosexual and lesbian couples,\" LiveScience quoted U.S. sociologist Kristen Schilt, who co-authored the study, as saying. \"If we saw that same result among heterosexuals, everyone would be surprised, because we tend to think of heterosexual sex as normative and everybody kind of expects that.\"\n\nThe study was based on findings from two national surveys of American adults, conducted in 1990-91 and in 2008-10, respectively.\n\nThe findings also held true in a subsequent analysis that included men and women.\n\n\"[I]f they felt satisfied with their relationship, they were having sex just as often as heterosexuals,\" Schilt said, according to the article.\n\nA 2011 study found that lesbian relationships tended to be more satisfying for the women involved than their male-female counterparts, although gay male relationships tended to be more satisfying for the men, the article reported.<|endoftext|>Today I want to talk about this \"Alternative für Deutschland\". They claim that they are a political party, they are running for parliament. But in reality, they are a political gang.\n\nWhat is a political party? A political party is a group of people that thinks about political ideas, and formulates these into political goals. This group tries to get a certain number of people elected to the parliament. They may also want to participate in elections for other types of political bodies. For example, the \"Alternative für Deutschland\" is also running for the European Parliament.\n\nWhat is a political gang? A political gang is a group of people that thinks about political ideas, but only to a certain degree. The group isn't actually trying to get people elected, but tries to create political pressure in other ways. They may also try to influence public opinion, as far as that is possible for a political gang.\n\nBoth political parties and political gangs are a waste of time. Both types of group are only interested in the power to influence. If one looks at the political agenda of the AfD, it can be seen that it is only interested in getting into the parliament. They don't care about any political ideas. They don't have any. They only want to get their political friends into the parliament.\n\nSome AfD members might think that they are doing their country a service. But in reality, they are helping to lower the political quality of Germany. They are helping to lower the German nation's intellectual level. They are doing this by political gang behavior. By not acting as a political party, they are deliberately working against democracy, and undermining the nation's sovereignty.\n\nIf the AfD members want to get into the parliament, they should at least act like a political party. They should actually talk about ideas. The AfD should have a political program. This political program should deal with Germany's immigration and emigration problems, as well as with other political issues. This program should be something that all members of the party agree upon. This program should then be explained to the public in a reasonable manner. The program should be accessible to everyone.\n\nThe AfD should make their political program available to the public in book form. This book should be made available for a minimal fee, and it should be available online, too. This book should be available in the \"Kaufhof\" chain of bookstores, as well as on Amazon.com and other online bookstores. It should also be available in the electronic version of the book on the AfD website.\n\nThe AfD could use the money received from selling the political program to cover their political expenses. This would also help to explain the political program to the public. It could even result in the members of the AfD getting a new impression of what a political party should be.\n\nA political gang should not run for parliament. They should not call themselves a political party. A political gang is not a substitute for a political party. In the future, political parties should not allow political gangs to run in elections.<|endoftext|>An engine control unit is a specialised computer that tells the fuel injectors when to spray, what sort of fuel to spray, and how long to spray it for. It also controls various other factors that affect the engine's performance and emissions.\n\nOriginally, engines were controlled by a mechanical device known as a carburettor. This device was connected directly to the throttle cable, which meant that any time the throttle was moved, the carburettor was told to add more fuel. This is an incredibly inefficient way of controlling engine performance, as it is affected by air temperature and pressure as well as throttle position.\n\nTo overcome this, an engine control unit is used to control the air/fuel mixture. In order to do this, the ECU has to measure the engine's performance. It does this by reading various sensors in the engine bay. These sensors tell the ECU how the engine is performing, allowing the ECU to increase or decrease the amount of fuel being sprayed into the engine.<|endoftext|>(Warning: Contains graphic content)\n\nThe Obama administration’s refusal to recognize the Benghazi attack as a terrorist attack was the subject of some of the most pointed questioning by Sen. Rand Paul in Secretary of State John Kerry’s appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday.\n\n“The reason I’m asking this question is, if this had been an attack by a mob, if it had been an attack by people who were upset about a video, is this is how I’d have responded,” Paul said to Kerry. “I would have immediately called for the closing of the Embassies. I would have thought about the real danger to the embassy. And I would have asked all the people to leave the embassy. And when I went to the CIA, I would have said to everyone, ‘We’re going to have to do some of this in America. And if there’s any American that’s involved in any way, arrest them and interrogate them.’”\n\nHe went on: “In Libya, you didn’t do that. In Egypt, you didn’t do that. You didn’t do that in Turkey. You’re doing it in Yemen. And so I would say, yes, I think it’s fair to say it was a terrorist attack.”\n\nHe then asked Kerry why the administration hadn’t acted more forcefully when the attack occurred, especially in light of the knowledge that al-Qaeda had been attempting to establish a presence in Libya.\n\n“I would’ve closed the embassy. I would have said it’s not worth the risk to do the work,” Paul continued. “I think I would have said this is a place that’s so chaotic, we’re putting our embassy in a very bad place. I would have admitted it.”\n\nKerry refused to directly answer the questions posed to him by Paul, instead pointing out that the State Department had"

He had some pretty choice words for Bernie Sanders’ supporters. You know, the “purists” who want a “revolution”.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal posted video of the moment and I’m so glad they did. You won’t believe what he said.\n\nWatch:\n\n“I think it’s very interesting. There’s a reason that young people are saying: ‘Hey, I’m really concerned about this issue of income inequality, but I’m not sure I’m willing to take a million dollars in negative ads to get somebody who will have the same position I will have when I wake up in the morning.’ I think they’re willing to take that chance to say: ‘This is really important to us. And we’re going to help you through this primary process to say it’s important to you and we’re going to give you ideas and ways to change things.’\n\nAnd that’s what I think they mean. They’re not just being, I think, naive politically. I think they mean what they say. And I think they’re going to be a very powerful force.”\n\nWow, that’s some rant. Let’s unpack that a little.\n\nFirst, Bernie’s supporters aren’t saying they want their candidate to win the nomination just to vote for Clinton. They want him to win. They want to see the revolution he’s been talking about since he started running for president.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering how he’s going to get to the White House without the millions of dollars in negative ads that are part of the “swamp” Clinton herself says she’s going to drain, the answer is by actually inspiring people to vote for him because of his ideas. He’s not taking money from big corporations and wealthy people. He’s getting it from individual donors, just like Bernie Sanders.\n\nSecond, if Sanders supporters are supposed to be naive to think they can get a revolution by electing a candidate who will help to bring one about, then Hillary Clinton supporters are just plain delusional. There’s no way she can do it without the millions of dollars she’s raising. She doesn’t inspire anyone. She’s a wealthy, out-of-touch candidate whose campaign is all about her because she has so little to offer the American people that she has to convince them she’s not a “crook”.\n\nHer policies are so conservative that she’s found herself on the wrong side of the issues where she’s actually needed to take a stand. Hillary doesn’t believe in the actual goals of a revolution.\n\nWhat do you think? Is Hillary a stronger candidate for her own revolution or for Bernie’s?\n\n<|endoftext|>>\n\n\n\nTHEY WENT ON TO FIND HIM TURNING OVER DIRT IN THE GARDEN.\n\n“IT’S FINE,” THE PHONE EXPLODED, “I JUST WANTED TO BE SURE\n\nIT WASN’T YOU.”\n\nTHEY WENT BACK TO WORK.\n\nONE OF THEM GOT LUNCH OUT.\n\nTHEY WORKED AGAIN.\n\nTHE PHONE RANG.\n\nTHEY LEFT IT ON THE COUNTER, LISTENING.\n\nTHE PHONE SAID, “WILL YOU STOP WHISTLING\n\nTHE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE SEVENTH SONATA?”\n\nTHEY REPLIED, “NOPE.”\n\nTHE PHONE SAID, “I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING BETTER\n\nWITH YOUR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS THAN THIS.”\n\nTHEY SAID, “WE ARE.

"So I'll post the bottom line first, I don't recommend you go to Great Clips if you have hair that is even close to being down past your shoulders. Let's just say that there is no way that they can cut your hair unless it's wet, and as it dries, it ends up looking like they used a weed-whacker on it. When I arrived at the location (1220 S. Main St. in Bowling Green, OH) I was greeted by a nice girl who asked me how I wanted my hair cut. I said that I wanted it short, but with layers. I'm a senior in college, so it's nice to have something that makes me look professional in the summer time, without having to worry about how long it takes to style it each morning.\n\nSo she started cutting it and it looked good. It was only $11, which is a good price for a haircut. I waited there for about 15 minutes before the girl finished cutting it and called me over to the dryers. I sat down and she blow dried my hair with a round brush, which I don't normally do, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference. As she started to dry it, I started to notice how choppy it looked. She said \"it looks really good. I'm glad I cut it so short, I was thinking about cutting it longer, but I think you look good like this\". I was disappointed because my hair looked terrible, but at least it was only $11, and I was able to get it cut before I had to go back to class.\n\nWhen I went to class, I went up to my professor to show her how awful the haircut looked. She told me that I needed to go to the student center to get it fixed. I was getting really frustrated because I had class at 3:15, and there were no available appointments to fix it, so I was told to come back tomorrow. When I got back, I went to the salon and they told me that it would take 20 minutes to fix, and would cost $30. I said that I didn't think it was worth the money to have them fix it, so I asked how I could get my money back. They said I could go to another location and get another haircut to use the coupon that was still on it.\n\nThe next morning, I went to Great Clips on South Highway 25. I got there and was greeted by a very nice girl. I explained to her the situation, and she said that she would be happy to fix it. She washed it out and put a trim on it. When she was done, I went back over to the mirror and could barely recognize myself. I had long, flowing layers. It was beautiful. I went back to the girl who helped me and she handed me a card for $5 off my next visit. I was glad to know that I had someone I could trust to cut my hair from now on.<|endoftext|>In 1991, a group of school children tried to tell their parents, teachers and fellow students about a monster that haunted their town.

Some of these undead are highly intelligent, acting as soldiers in armies or guardians of tombs. More powerful undead have been known to roam the world under their own volition, seeking to kill the living for revenge or to fuel their undeath.\n\nBeing intelligent creatures, undead can be found in many different social standings. In the cities of civilized races, the dead are commonly entombed and given proper funerals, while necromancers sometimes command vast armies of the undead to do their bidding.\n\nAnimate Dead [ edit ]\n\nThe magic-user is able to make the corpse of a creature move and attack.\n\nThe undead created will depend on the level of the magic-user:\n\nIf the magic-user is 1st level, then the undead can be a corpse of a man-sized animal such as a wolf, bear, or lion. The corpse may be \"animated\" with the appropriate skills such as: Climb, Hide, or Move Silently. The DM will determine what skills the corpse has.\n\nIf the magic-user is 2nd level, then the undead can be a man-sized corpse with two or more of the above skills. For every level beyond 2nd level, the corpse may gain another skill.\n\nAnimated dead may be commanded by the controlling magic-user as a free action, or they may be allowed to wander without purpose as mindless automatons. The undead may also be set to attack one target only or be left free to attack any target within range. The undead may be controlled in such a way as to be under the command of any creature holding the control device, as a charge-based device or wand, as a magical amulet, or by any other means.\n\nIf the magic-user is killed, then the control device is automatically destroyed. If the magic-user is unwilling to control the undead, or if he wishes to relinquish control, then the undead must make a Will save against the magic-user's level +2 or become uncontrolled.\n\nThe animate dead spell cannot create any undead creature with a 4+1 or better on the Hit Dice. If the corpse is missing a limb or appendage, the corpse may not use that particular appendage. The missing limb may be reattached by a cleric with 8+ experience level. The reattachment requires 1 minute of chanting, a flask of holy water, a light fire, and two torches.\n\n\n\nExample: Thaeron, a 1st level magic-user, animates a dead wolf with the skill climb, but the wolf has no skill of hide. This wolf can move, but is not able to hide from the sight of the living.\n\n\n\nExample: Kairon, a 3rd level magic-user, animates a wolf, giving it the skills of climb, hide, and move silently. Kairon now has a very stealthy animal to use for reconnaissance.\n\n\n\nExample: Emric, a 5th level magic-user, animates a dead lion. Emric now has a formidable beast to add to his retinue.\n\nCAUTION: Undead created through this spell may not be raised or resurrected. Only the spell life can restore the dead to life.\n\nAstral Prison [ edit ]\n\nThe magic-user causes a single creature to be imprisoned within its own body. This spell cannot be dispelled, but may be ended by a successful Dispel Magic spell cast upon the victim.\n\nThe victim of the Astral Prison spell will not be able to take any actions, but will be able to communicate normally with any creature within the same square as the victim. The victim will be able to leave his body for up to 4 turns each day, during which time he can move anywhere within spell range and return to his body at will.\n\nThe victim of the Astral Prison spell is not considered helpless while his body is within the Astral Plane.\n\n\n\nExample: Rab, a 1st level magic-user, controls Grog, a 6th level fighter, who is a real bully and would do well to be imprisoned. Rab casts Astral Prison on Grog. Grog is trapped within his own body and is now helpless. Grog can use up to 4 turns each day in which he may leave his body and attack from afar.\n\nCause Disease [ edit ]\n\nThe magic-user may make a touch attack on a creature within spell range, and the victim must make a Fortitude save vs. the magic-user's level or be afflicted by a random disease.\n\nThe spell-caster may attempt to use the cause disease spell a number of times per day equal to his magic-user level. The save DC against the disease is 10 + magic-user level.\n\nThe caster must be"

It is not enough to be just a ‘nice guy,’” he said.\n\nThe pope noted that in the time of St. Paul, there was a prevalent belief that in order to gain access to the temple, it was enough to pay taxes and be a Roman citizen, and Paul had to tell them that they were “without God.”\n\n“In our time, we are a little like the pagans of Paul’s time,” he said.\n\n“We go along thinking, we are a ‘citizen,’ a ‘good person,’ a ‘good Catholic,’ a ‘good Christian,’ and we do not realize that we are ‘without God.’”\n\nTo be a Christian, he said, is to “make Jesus Christ be born in every person.”\n\n“I do not want to be a ‘citizen,’ I do not want to be ‘a nice guy.’ No, I want to be a Christian,” the pope said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

This article is written to enlighten you with facts that may not be known to you about bees.\n\n#1: Male Bees are All Slackers\n\nIt has been a common fact that male bees are the slackers in the bee world. Male bees don't help much in the nest building or care of the young ones, but they enjoy mating and honey. As the female bees usually do all the work, some of them live alone.\n\n#2: They Don't See Red\n\nBees see in colors, but don't have the ability to see the color red. They don't have the ability to see this color because their eyes don't have red light receptors.\n\n#3: Do You Know What Bees Eat?\n\nWe all know that bees feed on nectar, but it is not their only source of food. Bees also feed on pollen, and other sweets.\n\n#4: Honey Bees Are Not Biting\n\nHoney bees have two tiny, barbed stingers and they sting only when they feel threatened or they are protecting their hives or their young ones. Honey bees don't go about biting people and this is the reason why they are so loved.\n\n#5: How Much Honey Do Bees Produce?\n\nBees use honey to survive the winter season. Bees produce honey by sucking out the nectar from flowers. Honey is a bee's primary food and it makes up 80% of its diet. The amount of honey produced by bees is variable and depends on the flowering of plants and the weather.\n\n#6: The Queen Has Only One Boyfriend\n\nA queen bee mates only once in her life. After this mating, she will live for about five years and during this time, she will lay more than 1500 eggs per day.\n\n#7: Only Worker Bees Produce Honey\n\nIn the beehive, only worker bees produce honey. The queen bee has no role to play in honey production. It is the workers who collect the nectar and turn it into honey. The queen just lays eggs.\n\n#8: Life Cycle of a Honey Bee\n\nA honey bee goes through three stages of development, which are: egg, larva and adult. It takes about 21 days for a honey bee to complete its life cycle.\n\n#9: The Nest of a Bee is Always Busy\n\nIf you think the nest of a bee is quiet and empty, you are mistaken. The nest of a bee is always busy and buzzing with activity. The queen bee lays around 1,500 eggs every day.\n\n#10: Did You Know That Bees Sting?\n\nWe have heard this fact many times, but we don't think that we will ever come across bees in our gardens. But bees can sting and they do sting if they feel threatened or disturbed.\n\n#11: Honey Bees Can Live Only in America\n\nThere are about 4,000 species of honey bees all over the world and only one species can be found in America. It is the European honey bee. This species of honey bee is found in South and Central America, North America and some parts of Asia and Australia.\n\n#12: A Bee Makes Six Flights Every Day\n\nEach bee has to make six flights every day for the development of the honey comb. Bees make their honeycombs in a hexagonal shape.\n\n#13: There Are Female Only and Male Only Bees\n\nBees are either female or male. There are no male bees without a stinger or female bees without a st"

This will be the last time for six years that conference will be held in the Salt Lake City Tabernacle on Temple Square. The event will be broadcast live in English, Spanish and Portuguese to millions of viewers around the world.\n\nDownloadable HD video for journalists\n\nDownloadable HD video for journalists\n\nDownloadable HD video for journalists\n\nThe October general conference sessions are always held in the Conference Center on Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The Conference Center was completed in 2000 and has been the location for the LDS Church's general conference sessions since that time.\n\nThe Conference Center seats 21,000 people, more than the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Although the Tabernacle was designed to seat more than 10,000 people, it has not been used for general conference in many years.\n\nThe Tabernacle, constructed in 1867, is the second oldest religious building in Utah and the oldest on Temple Square. The building has had many names and occupants, and it was damaged by fire several times.\n\nThe Tabernacle was the first home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and was used by the choir and others as a temporary home until the Assembly Hall was completed in 1877. The Tabernacle then became the home of the world-renowned choir for the next 62 years.\n\nThe Tabernacle was gutted by fire in 1867, 1873 and 1882. The fire in 1867 destroyed the roof, and the Tabernacle was closed for a year. Reconstruction and repairs were made quickly, and the Tabernacle reopened on July 4, 1868.\n\nThe Tabernacle, built of rock, mortar and local timber, was the only building on Temple Square for 30 years. In 1888, the Assembly Hall, built of wood, was added.\n\nThe Manti Temple, constructed in 1888, was the first building on Temple Square to be constructed of stone. The Utah State Capitol was completed in 1896, and the Temple block in Salt Lake City was becoming an architectural showcase.\n\nIn 1893, the Salt Lake Temple, constructed of granite and marble, was completed. The Salt Lake Temple and Tabernacle were designed by church architect Truman O. Angell. In addition to his work for the church, he designed the Cathedral of the Madeleine and the Ogden Tabernacle.\n\nDuring construction of the Temple and Tabernacle, Angell took measurements and photographs of the original Nauvoo Temple. Those measurements and photos provided the basis for construction of the Nauvoo Temple, which was completed in 2002.\n\nAfter the completion of the Salt Lake Temple, many of the early leaders of the LDS Church felt the need to have another temple built in Salt Lake City to accommodate the thousands of faithful members who could not live in the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nWork on the Endowment House, the temple precursor, began in 1855. However, construction was delayed because of a financial depression. The LDS Church decided to cease construction of the Endowment House in 1856 and to use the structure as a school for Indian children.\n\nIn 1869, construction of the Endowment House resumed. The original plan called for an expanded facility, but the leaders of the LDS Church decided to keep the building small, and the temple ordinances were performed in the Endowment House for the next 62 years.\n\nThe Endowment House was destroyed by fire on the morning of Dec. 17, 1892. The decision to build a new temple was made immediately, and the location of the new temple was decided in the afternoon.\n\nThe decision to build a new temple came from the experiences of church president Wilford Woodruff in the St. George Temple. Woodruff often stayed in the St. George Temple during visits to southern Utah. During one of those visits, he had a dream in which he saw an angel. The angel instructed him to return to the St. George Temple and perform the sacred endowments.\n\nUpon his return, Woodruff was unable to locate the temple and was disappointed. However, as he was returning to his hotel, he had a second dream in which he again saw the angel. The angel instructed Woodruff to perform the sacred endowments in the St. George Temple as soon as possible.\n\nIn addition, the LDS Church presidency was in dire need of a new temple. The Endowment House was becoming crowded and was not large enough for the members.\n\nAfter his experiences in St. George, Woodruff was directed by an angel to build a new temple. The building committee selected the site in 1892 and selected the current location for the temple in 1894.\n\nThe LDS Church has been in continuous construction of temples since 1833, when the Kirtland Temple was completed. The first temple was destroyed in a fire in 1838.\n\nAs of the beginning of the semiannual general conference on Oct. 3, 2016, there were 137 temples in operation around the world and a total of 148 in various stages of construction. The first LDS temple outside of the United States was built in Bern, Switzerland, and dedicated in 1955.\n\nThe Salt Lake Temple, the oldest LDS temple still in operation, is in the final stages of a two-year renovation.\n\nThe conference sessions will begin with a meeting of general conference leadership, including the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, at 6:30 p.m. MST on Thursday.\n\nOn Friday, the session will begin at 9 a.m. and be broadcast live on the LDS Church satellite system and on Mormon Channel, with rebroadcasts throughout the day.\n\nThe priesthood and Sunday sessions will be held at 10 a.m. The general priesthood meeting will be broadcast live on Mormon Channel and on the LDS Church satellite system, with rebroadcasts throughout the day.\n\nThe general women's meeting will be held at 5 p.m. The meeting will be broadcast live on Mormon Channel and on the LDS Church satellite system, with rebroadcasts throughout the day.\n\nThe general sessions on Saturday will begin at 10 a.m. The priesthood and Sunday sessions will be held at 1 p.m. Both of the Saturday sessions will be broadcast live on Mormon Channel and on the LDS Church satellite system, with rebroadcasts throughout the day.\n\nFollowing the conference sessions, the Tabernacle Choir will present a concert in the Conference Center at 8 p.m. on Saturday, which will be broadcast live on the LDS Church satellite system and on Mormon Channel.\n\n[email protected]<|endoftext|>The 9/11 suspects and the FBI's elite\n\nThere's a new development in the endless story of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the killing of Osama bin Laden: Allegations that FBI agents on an elite unit violated rules by exceeding their surveillance authority.\n\nIn the latest investigative account, the Associated Press reports that these agents also spent as many as 15,000 hours each — that's five full-time work years — monitoring as many as 5,000 Americans. The AP claims this happened from 2002 to 2008.\n\nThe allegations are already roiling Capitol Hill, and the case could become a major embarrassment for the FBI. Lawmakers are raising questions about why they weren't told sooner, and what kind of surveillance was involved.\n\nThis development has some historical echoes for me. I reported in the 1990s on the FBI's counterterrorism squad, code-named PENTTBOMB, and the challenges agents faced. After 9/11, I investigated problems with the bureau's efforts to recruit translators — a problem it has still not fully overcome. And I reported that one al-Qaeda plotter who slipped through the FBI's fingers was involved in a New Jersey case that also raised privacy concerns.\n\nThe FBI's new problems stem from an agent on the bureau's \"transnational\" squad. That team was established in 2000 to collect intelligence on threats from groups or individuals abroad, then translate and analyze it for use by FBI agents on domestic crimes.\n\nThe PENTTBOMB squad had been formed after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which was committed by an American who used fertilizer and fuel oil to kill 168 people. Among the dead were 19 children, and the blast devastated a federal office building.\n\nAn FBI supervisor suspected an Islamic extremist link, so PENTTBOMB agents were put on the case. The name is a truncation of \"pentagon\" and \"Tower,\" a reference to the location of the attack.\n\nThe team went on to investigate two other attacks with similar ties: the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed more than 200 people and injured 5,000 more, and the 2000 attack on the USS Cole off Yemen, which killed 17 American sailors.\n\nThe PENTTBOMB team eventually went on to a separate mission: tracking Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks.\n\n(For a while, the FBI's most prominent post-9/11 agent was John O'Neill, who died in the World Trade Center attacks. O'Neill was on the PENTTBOMB squad and had been the chief of counterterrorism at the FBI's New York office. I spoke with him a number of times in 1998 and 1999. He was brusque, profane and passionate about terrorism.)\n\nA good deal has been written about the efforts to find and kill bin Laden, so I won't"

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn American society, the most important basis for a successful marriage is to be found in the universal and unchanging relationship of male and female. The male as head of the family has an intrinsic responsibility for the wellbeing and well-being of his wife and children. For a man, failure to fulfill that responsibility constitutes not only a sin against God but also a sin against society. The reason for this is that men are obliged to marry to propagate the race. Since the greater portion of the burden for this is placed upon men, they must realize their responsibility for providing a home. The institution of marriage, then, is a social and economic institution. Without it, society would not survive.\n\nThe idea of male headship is also founded on the fact that men and women are intrinsically different, as the Creator has made them. From the beginning of Creation, God has given men the leadership role, which was expressed in the headship of Adam over Eve. Even in the animal world, males take the leadership role over females. This idea of male headship continues through the history of Israel as the Lord selected men for leadership roles: Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, for example. Even after the sin in the Garden of Eden, God instructed Adam that it was necessary for him to provide for his wife and children.\n\nThe male and female are fundamentally different in some significant ways. Males have always been given greater physical strength. Moreover, women, as a whole, are physically weaker. They are also emotionally more sensitive than men and, therefore, have the responsibility for bearing and raising children. The male is, however, called upon to be the provider for the family. The man is, therefore, also obligated to work hard to provide for his wife and children, as a way of showing his love for his family. Men are to do this while their wives are bearing and raising children, so that they may also participate in these responsibilities to the fullest extent possible.\n\nTo further clarify the distinction between male and female, we have to consider the differences between a man and a woman's sexuality. God created women and men with different sexual natures, which include both a complementary function and a distinctive one. The function is complementary in the sense that a man and woman can only have sexual union with one another. Thus, their bodies are in harmony. However, the distinctive nature of men and women is that men can perform the sexual act without giving birth to children. The woman, however, cannot perform the sexual act without giving birth to children.\n\nMarriage is intended to be a total commitment between a man and woman. As such, it is a lifetime commitment, made by two people who give themselves to each other and to God. The importance of marriage to God is shown in the fact that He has designed it to be a lifelong relationship. Moreover, when man rejects the ideal of marriage that God has established for society, the relationship becomes a base matter of selfishness and self-gratification. Such a relationship is, at best, a poor substitute for the God-ordained institution. However, as in all sin, it is not the same as the ideal. Sin always has a negative effect on society. It is for this reason that God calls on mankind to obey Him. It is also why the Scriptures say that God hates divorce.\n\nII. WHY DIVORCE IS HATED BY GOD\n\nThe Scriptures show that divorce is a sin that God hates. He is displeased with it because it brings the curse of God on a society. The Scriptures condemn it in the strongest possible language and hold the man who has divorced his wife as being worse than the man who has never married at all.\n\nThe Mosaic Law expressly forbid divorce. This is not to be understood in a legal sense, since the Jews could divorce their wives by reason of her adultery (Deut. 22:21). Moreover, the Jews could divorce a non-Jewish wife by reason of her apostasy (Deut. 24:1-4). In both of these cases, the idea of divorce is understood in a religious context and is not limited to a legal system. This is true of other cases of divorce in the Old Testament as well. The husband can also divorce his wife for the more general reasons of neglect and cruelty (Deut. 22:19-21). In these cases, the idea of divorce is in a more general sense and not limited to a legal system.\n\nAt the beginning of the Christian Era, the Christian Church began to understand that marriage was intended to be a total commitment between two people, who had made a vow before God. Such a vow is understood to be a promise of lifelong commitment to each other and to God. As such, it was understood that such a vow could not be broken. In the fourth century, the Roman Church, under the leadership of Constantine, recognized this by excluding divorce from the authority of the Church. This is one of the reasons that marriage is seen as a sacrament in the Roman Church. It is also why the Church has, since that time, refused to grant a decree of divorce, even for adultery.\n\nThe idea of a lifetime commitment between a man and woman is also evident in the case of Paul and his wife, who are said to be \"one flesh.\" Thus, Paul is exhorting believers to live in such a way that they do not bring disgrace upon their \"brother.\" Moreover, Paul recognizes that this marriage between himself and his wife is the basis for all marriage. Therefore, if a believer is to live with his wife as if she were his sister, this would also require that he do the same to all the brothers and sisters of the Church.\n\nThe Apostle Peter speaks of divorce in his first letter in language similar to Paul's. This was also the view of the Early Church, both Catholic and Protestant. It is also the view of the Orthodox Churches, who do not permit divorce.\n\nIII. CHURCH TEACHINGS ON DIVORCE\n\nThe Church Fathers, such as Origen, did not believe that there could be a legal dissolution of marriage. According to Origen, \"Christ was not to dissolve those marriages that are joined together by the solemn authority of the state, nor was He to abolish these rules which man in his law has established for the purpose of the procreation and the education of children, but He was to strengthen them.\" The Church Fathers believed that divorce was wrong because it separated man and wife. Marriage was a sacred union, which was made by God and was not subject to man's laws. However, this was not to be understood in a legal sense. It was wrong to divorce one's wife even though the laws of a nation permitted it. Moreover, this was to be the case even if the woman had committed adultery. Divorce was still wrong.\n\nThe Church Fathers viewed marriage as a sacrament. The idea that marriage was a sacrament is present in the early Church, even though it was not a formal decree of the Church until the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. Marriage is recognized as a sacrament because it represents the love between Christ and His Church. Marriage is thus a sign of the covenant between Christ and His Church. Marriage is not only a sign of this covenant but also a means by which this covenant is expressed. Therefore, marriage is an important sacrament of the Christian Church.\n\nIn his Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, St. Augustine makes it clear that the idea of a \"sacrament\" does not mean that marriage is a sign of the love between Christ and His Church. Marriage is a sacrament in the sense that it is a sacred reality, which is the sign of something else. It is the sacred reality, the divine idea that is the true sign of marriage. This is true of all the sacraments, in which the sign is a reality that is above the natural order. Therefore, the sacramental sign is but a small part of the reality to which it points. It is for this reason that the Church has forbidden remarriage after divorce. It is not because the Church has an opinion of divorce. The Church has always had an opinion of divorce. In the Early Church, however, remarriage after divorce was considered a sin. This is true even in cases where the woman had committed adultery.\n\nThe Orthodox Churches and the Roman Catholic Church have the same view on this matter. The Orthodox Church is opposed to divorce because it violates the principle of unity between Christ and His Church. They also understand the doctrine of marriage as an indissoluble union. It is this idea of marriage that is seen as the basis of the Orthodox teaching. The Roman Catholic Church also has the same view as the Orthodox Churches. The difference between the two churches is that the Roman Church has understood this to be a teaching that is rooted in Divine Revelation, whereas the Orthodox Churches have taken this to be the position of the Early Church.\n\nHowever, both the Roman Church and the Orthodox Churches have also taken this to be the teaching of the Early Church. In his Homilies on the Epistles of Paul to the Corinthians, Origen declares that marriage is a symbol of the union between Christ and His Church. This is the same teaching that is found in the Roman Church. Origen also takes this to be the teaching of the Early Church.\n\nIn his Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Augustine takes the same position. He sees marriage as a sacrament, in the sense that it represents the union between Christ and His Church. He states, \"The bond of a valid marriage, which is"

Charles Monroe-Kane is fascinated with cockroaches. Now, there's a big theme.\n\n\n\nMonroe-Kane's show at the Linda Hodges Gallery, titled \"Cockroach\", features thirteen pieces that feature his favored theme. It may be an unusual choice of subject, but then again, artists have often been drawn to the taboo or the forbidden or the socially unacceptable.\n\n\n\nIn most of these pieces Monroe-Kane depicts, either alone or in various groups, roaches in a variety of settings. One of his works, titled \"The Cockroach Hike\", consists of a lone cockroach walking across a granite boulder. The rock is set in an ethereal mist that obscures its exact location, but somehow I suspect it's not in California. It's a stunning piece.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite works in this show, titled \"The Dead Roach Walking\", shows a dead cockroach standing up, covered in a sparkling coating of gold paint. It's as if it had been so dead for so long that it was actually turned to gold. The title comes from the Elvis Presley song of the same name. The roach, painted gold, is wearing Elvis's famous white sequin jumpsuit. The letters \"CELEBRITY\" adorn the creature's abdomen. This is a truly macabre yet"

There are so many different breeds out there and each breed has different personality traits. If you do your research, you can easily find the breed that is right for you. There are rabbits that are great lap pets while others are not so great and would rather be sitting in their own personal hutch.\n\nThe most common type of rabbit is the domestic rabbit. Domestic rabbits can be either the mini version or the full size version. The difference between the two is the mini version has a shorter body and the full size has a longer body. Some breeds will have more length to them than others.\n\nThe most common of the domestic rabbit breeds is the Holland Lop. The Holland Lop has a tiny, short body, stocky build, and short fur. Their fur is typically brown and they have floppy ears that hang down along their body. They're also very friendly, are very cuddly, and are fairly easy to care for.\n\nThe second most common of the domestic rabbit breeds is the Dutch. This rabbit breed has a longer body, stocky build, and short fur. Their fur is typically brown or white. They're not very friendly, but if you take the time to tame them, they can become very cuddly and affectionate. They are very vocal and have a \"honking\" type of noise they make when they're excited.\n\nThe third most common of the domestic rabbit breeds is the lionhead. The lionhead has a shorter body, stocky build, and a long coat of hair. The lionhead is also fairly vocal and has a \"honking\" type of noise they make when they're excited. They're not as friendly as the Dutch and the Holland Lop, but if you take the time to tame them, they can become very cuddly and affectionate.\n\nRabbits are great pets and if you decide to adopt one, make sure you find the breed that's right for you.<|endoftext|>Victor Etienne\n\n“We worked for a couple of weeks.

Gerald R. Ford, CVN-78, would be a man who began his naval career at age 17 as a third class fireman. Rick Bowers began his naval career on March 31, 1987, aboard the U.S.S. Albany (CA-123) as a third class fireman. On the Albany, he performed duties on the main deck of the ship, most notably in the boilers and auxiliary machinery spaces. Bowers had two years left to serve when he left the Albany to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1989. Following boot camp, he attended the Marine Corps Radio and Electric School in Memphis, Tennessee, for six months. After his schooling, he was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines,"

"A high school gym teacher from McDonough, Georgia has been arrested for an alleged sexual relationship with a female student.\n\nEverett Lee Compton, 27, of McDonough, was arrested by police in Henry County, Georgia on April 8 on one count of sexual assault against a person in custody, one count of sexual assault by a person with supervisory or disciplinary authority, and one count of sexual assault by a person in a position of trust or authority, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThe student at Henry County High School reported the relationship to police after her parents caught her exchanging explicit photos with Compton, who she said had “started” her “on fire for God.”\n\n“I’ve never seen her like this,” the student’s mother said, “I don’t even know who this is.”\n\n“I know you said you love him and all that,” the girl’s mother told her, “but he’s a teacher.”\n\nThe mother told police that she confronted the teacher over text message, which is how they first learned about the relationship, but Compton denied the relationship.\n\n“I’m going to ask you to do something for me,” he wrote in a text message. “I’m not saying it didn’t happen but let me handle this my way.”\n\nThe student reportedly told police that she and Compton met at her father’s home, where the two smoked marijuana.\n\n“I felt sick to my stomach,” the student’s mother told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “I kept trying to tell myself that it was a student who had a crush on him, but when it came out that they smoked marijuana together, that’s when I knew something inappropriate was going on.”\n\n“This has destroyed my daughter,” she added.\n\nCompton was booked into the Henry County Jail on April 8, where he remains as of April 10.\n\nHis arrest comes just a month after 27-year-old Brittany Zamora, a teacher at Las Brisas Academy Elementary School in El Paso, Texas, was arrested and charged with three counts of sexual assault of a child and three counts of improper relationship with a student.\n\nZamora is accused of having a sexual relationship with an eighth-grade student, who told police that she and Zamora had kissed on two occasions, and that Zamora had touched her breast on another occasion.\n\nAccording to police, Zamora also admitted to having had sex with the student on a bed in her apartment, but claims the student was the one who initiated it.\n\n“The child told her that she wanted to have sex with her, and she knew it was wrong, but did it anyway,” El Paso police said in a press release, adding that Zamora later admitted to exchanging inappropriate texts with the student.\n\nZamora is currently out on bond, and has been placed on paid administrative leave.<|endoftext|>Private Jets for Sale\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nBuying a private jet may sound like an unattainable dream, but there are companies that specialize in selling pre-owned aircrafts.

It can be thought of as a huge hashmap, with the ability to do a variety of different operations in an atomic fashion. One of the most common use cases for Redis is a LRU cache. In this post I'll describe the inner workings of the LRU algorithm in Redis, and how to use it effectively to speed up your applications.\n\nRedis and LRU\n\nRedis has a variety of different datatypes that you can store in a key. You can store a string, a list, a hash, a set, and even more exotic types like geospatial indexes and pub/sub channels.\n\nThe most common datatype you'll use in Redis is the hash, which is just a set of strings, stored under a single key. You'll also use the string type to store a variety of things, including session ids, and passwords.\n\nOne thing that you can do with a hash in Redis is use it as a cache. If you want to store a large dataset in memory, but want to do it with a very small footprint, you can use Redis as a hash-based cache.\n\nThe implementation of the LRU algorithm in Redis is more than just a simple feature, it is also the method that allows Redis to work as a cache. The LRU algorithm allows Redis to store your data in a very compact way, while also keeping it easily accessible.\n\nA Simple Example\n\nSuppose you have an application that stores a hash map of users, and each user has a name and a list of sessions. A session is just a string that represents an entry in the cache.\n\nIf we want to write the number of users in a session to the console, we can do something like this:\n\nIn redis-cli , type smembers *:user_name* , where user_name is the name of the user in the hash. This will return a list of sessions in this user's hash. Type smembers *:sessions* , where sessions is the key we used to store the sessions. This will return the number of sessions that we had in step 2.\n\nAs a quick note, in this example I am using \"*\" as a wildcard, this is done because I am not guaranteed that my keys have any characters after the colon.\n\nThis is the simplest example, but it works well to show how to use the Redis LRU algorithm to your advantage.\n\nIf you have a hash where each element represents a cached entry, your application is running well if each time you query the hash, the number of elements that you get is exactly the number of times you are using the hash in your application.\n\nTo explain why this is, let's do a simple analysis of a few different cases.\n\nImagine that the user \"John Smith\" has a hash, where each key is a session, and each value is a timestamp.\n\nIf we have 50 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return the same number of elements every time.\n\nIf we have 50 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return the same number of elements every time. If we have 10 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return exactly 10 elements every time.\n\nIf we have 10 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return exactly 10 elements every time. If we have 5 sessions for user John Smith, and we are querying the hash once per second, it should return either 5 or 6 elements every time, depending on whether the hash was queried during the first or second query.\n\nThis simple example is sufficient to show that the number of queries that are made to the cache are more important than the average number of items returned.\n\nThe number of times you query your cache is directly related to the amount of work your application is doing. If you have a lot of work to do, your application will make more queries to your cache. The way we can use this is by tuning the value of our cache to be more or less aggressive.\n\nThere are a few things that you can change to influence the aggressiveness of your cache. These are listed below.\n\nsize of the hash. How many elements the hash can have before we start dropping items.\n\nmax number of keys that can be in the hash\n\nmax number of elements per key that can be in the hash\n\nHere is an example that demonstrates how to increase the aggressiveness of a hash:\n\nredis> set maxmemory-policy volatile-lru maxmemory-samples 5 redis> set maxmemory-policy volatile-lru maxmemory-expand on\n\nIf you run the same example as above, and then run the two commands above, you will see a noticeable change. If you have a small hash, the new settings will be a dramatic change, if you have a large hash, the impact will be small.\n\nWhen using a hash, the number of elements per key is the key factor in determining the effectiveness of the LRU"
"A band of killer whales was spotted today off the coast of Victoria, British Columbia, with a mystery creature they had killed and were feeding on.\n\nThe encounter, which was captured by boaters on video, was \"not common at all,\" naturalist David Ellifrit told ABC News.\n\n\"They do feed on other animals, but it's generally much larger things,\" he said, estimating the creature was about 20 feet long. \"The fact that the whales killed this animal and are feeding on it is really quite unique.\"\n\nThe 15-member orca pod was spotted at around 2 p.m. about a half mile offshore of Race Rocks, an area of islands and rocks off the southwest coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Ellifrit said. The mammals were hunting a giant squid.\n\n\"They've killed it, but they haven't finished feeding yet,\" he said, adding that he's never seen anything like it in his three decades of experience in the area.\n\nWhile most people think of killer whales eating fish, Ellifrit explained that the mammals are carnivorous and eat marine mammals like seals and other sea creatures like sea lions and large sharks.\n\nCourtesy OrcaLab\n\n\"They're really, really fascinating,\" he said of killer whales. \"They're very special animals.\"\n\nEllifrit said it's impossible to tell from the video if the mysterious animal was a shark or some other sea creature.\n\n\"It was clearly dead,\" he said. \"They're playing with it.\"\n\nHe added that the pod of orcas could have been feeding on the creature for a couple of hours.\n\nCourtesy OrcaLab\n\n\"It was moving through the water really, really quickly,\" he said. \"It's probably a shark.\"\n\nEllifrit noted that this particular orca pod, known as the southern resident killer whales, live in the waters around Vancouver Island and have become a tourist attraction.\n\n\"They're one of the stars of the show here,\" he said.\n\nThe creatures were nearly extinct by the late 1960s, but were saved by a captive breeding program. They are now protected in Canada, and considered an endangered species in the United States.<|endoftext|>The former head of the Democratic National Committee has a new role: commentator for the pro-Russia network RT.\n\nDonna Brazile’s contract with CNN was suspended last year after it was revealed that she shared debate questions with the Clinton campaign during the primaries. Now, she will make regular appearances on the Russian-government-funded media outlet.\n\nShe will be a contributor for the channel’s “Political Gabfest” program, according to a press release sent out Tuesday by the network.\n\n“The most exciting part of joining the ‘Political Gabfest’ is that I will be back in action on the campaign trail! I am eager to talk about the 2020 election and the road ahead for all of us,” Brazile said in a statement.\n\nBrazile is no stranger to controversy: In 2017, she published a book, Hacks, which included passages that some say contradicted her earlier denials about sharing the debate questions.\n\nIn her new role, Brazile will appear alongside former NPR program hosts (and brothers) John and Jon Ganzfried. The two work on RT under the name “The Gentlemen,” hosting the program “The Big Picture.”\n\n“Our show is about ‘the big picture’ issues facing America and the world, and how the decisions made by our government leaders both affect our daily lives and shape our nation’s future,” the brothers said in a statement. “We look forward to our spirited conversations with Donna, as well as her take on the most pressing issues of the day.”\n\nAs head of the DNC, Brazile gave the Clinton campaign a heads up on questions to expect during the primary debate against Bernie Sanders. In the book, she said she “wondered” whether she should give the Clinton team a heads up about the questions for the general election debates, but did not ultimately do so.\n\nRT’s founders and owners have direct ties to the Kremlin, and its funding comes from the Russian government.\n\nIn an interview with Variety, the brothers defended their role on RT, saying that they “weren’t trying to accomplish anything” by appearing on the network.\n\n“The network is no different from other networks, it’s just like CNN, MSNBC, or Fox,” said John Ganzfried.\n\n“The only difference is that they were more truthful about what they are. We are trying to be honest about what we are and that’s it.”\n\nHe added: “We have a lot of freedoms over here to do what we want, and the contracts we have over here are very fair.”\n\nRT has been the subject of criticism over its coverage of U.S. politics.\n\nIn one of the most high-profile incidents, RT was forced to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The channel is now required to include disclaimers at the bottom of its broadcasts saying that it is funded by the Russian government.\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter\n\nFreedom of Speech Isn’t Free\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation is working hard to balance out the biased American media.

"O técnico do Corinthians Tite espera um Corinthians equilibrado e capaz de buscar o resultado no jogo contra o Ferroviário, no Nílton Santos, pela primeira fase da Copa do Brasil. O treinador lamentou o estado físico dos jogadores do Timão, que perderam os últimos dois jogos do Brasileiro por 1 a 0 para o Grêmio e 4 a 1 para o Atlético-MG.\n\n\"Eu espero um jogo de equilíbrio, o que significa que o Corinthians tem de se equilibrar no que sabe fazer. O time joga e busca, mas isso deu certo ou errado depende do jogo. Agora, o que se espera é um equilíbrio\", disse.\n\nA situação do Corinthians ainda é pior. O clube precisa vencer por pelo menos cinco gols de diferença para avançar à próxima fase. Isso porque no jogo da estreia, contra o Boca Juniors, em Buenos Aires, os gols marcados foram expulsões e só foram marcados em cobranças de falta.\n\nO técnico alvinegro, no entanto, não vê o Corinthians como candidato à eliminação e acredita na classificação. \"Acho que não há nenhum candidato. Mas a chance de o Corinthians passar é bastante forte\", afirmou.\n\nTite se disse impressionado com a campanha do Ferroviário e com a torcida, que cercou a concentração do Corinthians na tarde desta terça-feira. Para o técnico, a participação do clube na Copa do Brasil é um orgulho, e a torcida, um motivo a mais para as vitórias. \"O grupo não deve esperar nenhum favor. Que tenha respeito pelo adversário, pelos torcedores do Ferroviário e por quem nos recebe com uma grande expectativa. É um clube que está no caminho certo e tem tudo para melhorar ainda mais\", declarou.\n\nSem Copa do Brasil, Corinthians já pensa no Brasileiro\n\nO técnico Fábio Carille comandará o Corinthians no clássico contra o Santos, no domingo, na Vila Belmiro, pela 32ª rodada do Campeonato Brasileiro. O treinador não descarta a possibilidade de escalar o time que vai enfrentar o Ferroviário, pela Copa do Brasil. \"Eu vou jogar contra o Santos um time que eu acho que a torcida vai gostar de ver\", disse.\n\nCarille garantiu ainda que todos os jogadores terão oportunidade de mostrar serviço na Copa do Brasil. \"Não estamos dando desculpas, vamos usar todo o nosso elenco. Vamos escolher os 11, mas não estamos jogando um jogo para eliminar ninguém. Todos têm condições de fazer uma boa partida\", disse.\n\nO Corinthians ainda tem mais duas partidas pela fase de grupos da Copa do Brasil.

It's not about doing anything other than restoring my reputation.\"\n\nKimmage said he had been \"decimated by the actions of Pat Kenny\" and that his financial position had been \"wiped out\" because of the actions of Kenny.\n\n\"I have been left in financial and emotional ruins,\" he said.\n\nHe claimed he had received a message from Kenny after leaving the paper that he had \"betrayed the Sunday Independent\" and that he was \"going to take him to the cleaners\".\n\nThe editor of the Sunday Independent said Kimmage's credibility was in question and that he was no longer a columnist that the newspaper could rely on.\n\nDenis O'Brien, the chairman of Communicorp, the parent company of the Sunday Independent, said that he was disappointed with the loss of Kimmage's column but he did not feel that his reputation had been damaged.\n\nBelfast Telegraph<|endoftext|>Genesee & Wyoming Inc. has agreed to purchase an 80-mile Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) rail line connecting Canadian National (NYSE: CNI) and Union Pacific rail yards in southern Oregon.\n\nGNWR is acquiring the Central Oregon & Pacific Railroad, which connects the line between Monmouth and Klamath Falls to Union Pacific’s transcontinental line at Independence, Ore., and connects with Canadian National at Madras, Ore., about"
"President Donald Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned on Monday night in the wake of reports that he had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the United States before Trump took office.\n\nFlynn's resignation came after reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about the contents of his communications with the Russian ambassador.\n\n\"In the course of my duties as the incoming national security adviser, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors,\" Flynn said in his resignation letter, which he also posted on Twitter.\n\n\"These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessar<|endoftext|>for a lot of reasons. To start, it's the latest blow to the administration's credibility after a litany of controversies, including reports that Trump's campaign aides were in constant communication with Russian intelligence officials during the election.\n\nBut it also illustrates the confusion and infighting that has defined the Trump White House.\n\n\"The problem is that, given all the chaos and competing power centers in the White House, it's not clear who is really running the show at any given time,\" said Ben Rhodes, a former senior foreign policy official under President Barack Obama. \"That makes it hard for the administration to have the kind of coherence it needs to conduct a well-organized foreign policy.\"\n\nFlynn's resignation followed a series of damaging leaks about the president's senior staff and other high-ranking administration officials.\n\nNational security adviser Flynn denied discussing sanctions with Russian envoy\n\nA report published Monday night said top Trump aides, including chief of staff Reince Priebus, White House counsel Don McGahn and press secretary Sean Spicer, kept Trump in the dark about Flynn's conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in order to \"protect the president from himself.\"\n\nIn mid-January, the administration told the Washington Post that Flynn did not discuss the sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia for meddling in the US election. Those sanctions were expected to be a topic of conversation between Flynn and Kislyak, but Pence and other senior officials, including McGahn, were apparently kept out of the loop about what exactly Flynn and Kislyak discussed.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the conversations between Flynn and Kislyak told The Post that Flynn's communications were \"incidentally collected\" as part of a top-secret intelligence report on Kislyak. After they reviewed the report, which has since been shared with Obama and Trump, McGahn and others acted quickly to warn Trump's senior staff about what they saw.\n\nMcGahn told Trump that Flynn's communications may have violated an obscure US law that forbids private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments against US interests, according to a separate Washington Post report on Tuesday.\n\nIt's not yet clear why Flynn, who was appointed as national security adviser with little experience in international relations, was having those conversations in the first place.\n\nSince the Trump campaign, Flynn has reportedly developed close ties with top officials in Russia, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and has been paid tens of thousands of dollars in fees by Russian companies.\n\nBut Flynn's resignation on Monday came amid a broader debate over Trump's ties to Russia, and it adds to a cloud of controversy around Trump's own attitude toward Russian meddling in the election. Trump has insisted on several occasions that the intelligence community has not reached a conclusion about whether Russian hackers sought to boost Trump's campaign, even though the intelligence community has reported the consensus view that it was Russia.\n\nDemocrats, in particular, have been vocally critical of Flynn's conversations, and of Trump's defense of Flynn.\n\n\"The speed at which we're learning about all of this is absolutely breathtaking,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Monday. \"I think we ought to slow down.\"\n\n\"You can't have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. \"This in the wake of what we know about Russian hacking and election interference. It is of profound concern, and there is a need for a serious and thorough investigation.\"\n\nBut Trump has yet to provide any details about what he believes Flynn discussed with Kislyak.\n\n\"I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right,\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"He was just doing his job. The thing is he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me.\"\n\nWhat is the Logan Act?\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said that Flynn did not discuss sanctions with Kislyak, and that he did not recall discussing the US's decision to expel Russian diplomats from the US in retaliation for the election-related hacking.\n\nWhen The Post first reported on Flynn's conversations in February, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Flynn had spoken to Kislyak on December 28, the day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for election-related hacking. The sanctions were imposed in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision not to retaliate after the US expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shuttered two Russian facilities in the US in response to the hacking of US political organizations and leaking sensitive information to WikiLeaks.\n\nBut Spicer later walked back that statement, saying that Flynn and Kislyak may have had a conversation, but that it was \"not a discussion of sanctions.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice informed the White House counsel on January 26 that Flynn was not entirely forthcoming about his conversations with Kislyak, according to The Post's first report. A day later, Pence learned that Flynn's conversations may have broken the law and expressed his concerns to Flynn, who assured him they did not.\n\nThe White House said in a statement last week that it had \"no idea\" about the true nature of the Flynn-Kislyak conversations, but the Post's report on Tuesday said that Trump knew Flynn misled Pence about their contents. Trump did not ask Flynn about it, however, until the Monday before he was fired, the report said.\n\nA person close to the White House told The Post that White House officials were \"stunned\" to learn how far along the Justice Department investigation was.\n\nAfter The Post's report on Tuesday, which said that Trump had known about Flynn's conversations since January 26, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN that Flynn had Trump's \"full confidence.\"\n\nBut Flynn resigned after a new report published Tuesday night said that the Justice Department had informed the White House that Flynn could be subject to blackmail because of his false statements about his conversations.\n\nFlynn has emerged as a key figure in the ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, but until recently, the investigation into his activities was limited to whether he had violated federal law by failing to properly disclose payments from Russia and Turkey.\n\nThe federal law that prohibits US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments against US interests, known as the Logan Act, is rarely enforced, but Flynn's conversations with Kislyak could have put him in violation.\n\nThe Logan Act was passed in 1799 to prevent citizens from trying to influence US foreign policy by making private deals with foreign governments. Only two people have been prosecuted under the act: in 1803, when a Kentucky farmer wrote a newspaper article in which he called on Americans to refuse to buy British goods, and in 1852, when an Indiana farmer tried to help Mexican Americans recover lost land after the Mexican-American War. Neither were convicted.\n\nWhen asked about the Logan Act in March, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said it was a \"silly\" law.\n\n\"I don't know what the intent was of the Logan Act, but the law is a little bit silly and a little outdated,\" he said. \"I'd say that his actions -- not just the reporting of the incident -- but also the following day, Flynn made clear that it was inaccurate.\"\n\nBut one of the US's top legal experts on the Logan Act says that Flynn's actions may be illegal.\n\n\"The issue is a very serious one,\" Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law and a CNN contributor, told CNN on Tuesday. \"This wasn't just a slip of the tongue. This wasn't just a statement to a reporter. This was something that, according to reports, he discussed with other senior Trump administration officials. It was something that the vice president of the United States apparently thought was serious enough to bring to the attention of the President himself.\n\n\"It's not just about the Logan Act. It's about everything else that is swirling around this administration,\" Vladeck said. \"If there is any evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russian officials or representatives to help swing the election, then we have another entirely different kettle of fish on our hands.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nCNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.<|endoftext|>Why is obesity so rampant? The nutritionists have tried many methods to help us lose weight and get in shape. Low carb, high protein, cabbage soup, you name it, but it all seems to fail over the long run.\n\nWhile many people do succeed for a time, their weight always returns. In fact, a recent study of a cabbage soup diet found that people lost an average of about 11 pounds over two months. Yet two years later, most had regained all of their weight.\n\nSo what's going on here? Why is it so hard to keep weight off over the long term? And why do many people gain even more weight back after the diet? Let's look at a key factor in this process, and what to do about it.\n\nOne problem with all these diets is that they don't necessarily change eating habits. They don't affect the foods we eat or how we eat them. And what's the main determinant of body weight? The foods we eat"

And yes, it was about the velocity of execution - but there was a lot more to it.\n\n\n\nThe idea was that when you learned a piece you should practise it very slowly, in order to get the fingering, phrasing, pedalling etc right. But once you could play the piece perfectly slowly, you needed to practise it more quickly, in order to make sure you got the fingering, phrasing and pedalling absolutely perfect at the quicker speed.\n\n\n\nCzerny practised every day for hours, he wrote over two thousand pieces for piano (many are now completely forgotten) and he was a friend of Beethoven and of the pianist and composer Franz Liszt. The School of Velocity actually explains a lot about Czerny and Liszt's tastes in music. It wasn't so much about technique - though obviously they wanted music that was extremely difficult to play, and music that sounded good at every speed. But it was also about a music that is rhythmically and intellectually complex. Music that sounded fine, and was fascinating, at any speed.\n\n\n\nIn the 19th century, composers and performers used to refer to a piece that was difficult to play as being 'virtuoso' music. Today, people are much more likely to say that a piece is 'virtuoso' if the performer is a brilliant soloist. There was an important link between the two ideas, but there was also a big difference.\n\n\n\nA piece might be virtuoso in the sense that it was musically hard to play. But if a soloist could play the piece perfectly well, then there was nothing virtuosic about it at all. You could hear that it was musically good - but it wouldn't sound difficult.\n\n\n\nI remember a performance of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring that I saw in the early 1970s, when I was a teenager. It was performed by a major orchestra with some top conductors, and it was an extremely well-rehearsed performance. It was also a pretty stodgy performance - there was no electricity, and hardly any excitement. It was an impressive feat, but it was also dull. The most memorable thing about the performance was the way the audience reacted to it - the British critics, who thought they were being sophisticated, sneered and scoffed, and the audience members, who hadn't really understood what they had just seen, shouted and cheered.\n\n\n\nSo I know very well that a piece can be virtuoso in the sense that it is musically exciting - and yet it can also be virtuoso in the sense that it is technically extremely hard to play. I also know that the relationship between the two is not straightforward.\n\n\n\nA well-played piece can be musically exciting, and yet the performer can miss out on all the virtuoso bits - they can play it slowly, without pedalling, and without any expression, and without making any effort to bring out the music. If you think about it, that can't be right. If a piece is technically easy to play - and musically boring - then it isn't really a virtuoso piece. It may be musically good - but it's not virtuoso.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot more to virtuosity than just playing a piece well. And you can tell that from some of the best music ever written.\n\n\n\nSo Liszt and Czerny's criteria for virtuoso music aren't the same as the criteria for 'musical virtuoso' music. To them, it was also about a sense of musical excitement. It was about a piece that sounded good at any speed - and which sounded good whether you played it fast or slow. In the 19th century, that was what virtuosity was about.\n\n\n\nThat's why they liked Liszt and Wagner so much. And that's why I like them too.\n\n\n\n<< Music & Vision home A musician's life >>\n\n<|endoftext|>The vaccinia virus is the only organism ever used as a vaccine that was proven to induce primary immunological responses against non-viral targets, including transgenes, defined epitopes of the target molecule, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Vaccinia-based vaccines are being increasingly used for the induction of humoral immunity and as templates for the development of delivery vectors and vectors for gene delivery and immunization. In addition, the use of vaccinia vectors is growing in gene therapy, immunotherapy, cancer vaccine, therapeutic vaccine, and prevention of infectious diseases.\n\n\n\nThis book provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the area of vaccinia vector technology. It includes detailed coverage of all the available vaccinia vector systems including their biology, molecular biology, immunology, safety and regulatory issues.\n\n<|endoftext|>Himawari-8 is a Japanese geostationary weather satellite developed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). It is the second in the Himawari series of satellites, following Himawari-7 which launched in October 2013.\n\nLaunch and orbital configuration [ edit ]\n\nHimawari-8 was launched by Arianespace using an Ariane 5ES carrier rocket flying from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. The launch occurred at 22:09 UTC on 2 October 2014, and marked Arianespace's sixth launch of the year and the second Ariane 5ES launch of the year.[3] It was the 70th Ariane 5 launch overall.\n\nThe satellite was built by Mitsubishi Electric, and is based on the DS-2000 satellite bus. It is equipped with two solar arrays, with a span of 33.9 metres (111 ft). It is expected to operate for ten years, although the JMA is required to maintain it for only five. It is expected to weigh approximately 2,800 kilograms (6,200 lb) at launch. The spacecraft was originally intended to be named Himawari 8, but was renamed before launch.\n\nIt was the third satellite to be launched for the second generation Himawari observation system. Himawari 8 and 9, along with the Himawari-7 satellite, will produce a continuous image of the Earth. A main difference from the first generation Himawari system is that the new satellites can scan the visible hemisphere with a 15-minute interval, allowing for more frequent observations and allowing meteorological phenomena to be analysed with greater speed and accuracy. Himawari-8 is positioned above the geostationary orbit at a longitude of 140° East.<|endoftext|>... quite the colour wizard, haha.

"I was searching the internet for a cheap way to create large water features. All I could find was the stock pond kits at Walmart. These kits are $400 and take up an awful lot of space for a smallish pond. I was looking for a cheaper alternative and I found it on this site. I ordered the Basic Fountain kit and I love it. It came with all the instructions to put it together and the necessary materials. I was a little nervous when I saw it, it seemed kind of flimsy, but after reading the instructions a few times, I went to town and put it together. It took me about 2 hours and then it was ready for water. The directions are easy to follow. I highly recommend this kit to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive way to create a water feature.<|endoftext|>BEST ANSWER\n\nOh wow, that is amazing! Thanks for sharing. My husband and I have talked about buying an old truck and refurbishing it. We are very practical people. So, with all of the families who need assistance with their old truck, this is a great idea! My husband does a lot of heavy construction work and we have seen old trucks that people have used as a source of income. My husband has thought about starting a truck repair business to take in used trucks. They do have to be restored a little bit, so he thought he could take some of the load off people and help them out with the money they need. He has thought about all of the used trucks that he sees in people's driveways and knows that they will never sell them because of how much work they are. We actually came across a pretty decent truck last weekend. The only thing wrong with it was that it had been used as a dump truck. It had a couple of huge dump bed holes in the bottom of it. We checked the engine and it runs good. We thought we could buy it and have it fixed up. It had low miles on it, so we thought it would be a good buy. I really thought my husband was going to buy it, but then he was thinking about all of the things that could go wrong with it. He would have had to drive it, so he was thinking about that. He also thought about all of the equipment and the backhoe and such that he would have had to buy if he bought it. My husband is a very smart man and he knew that it would be a lot of work, so we didn't even make an offer.\n\n\n\nI do know that I would love to find a nice truck and fix it up and then donate it to a needy family. I don't know what kind of license you need to operate a truck in your state, but I would like to look into that. I don't think we would charge for the use of the truck. I think we would just want the families to know that we would not be calling on them and checking up on them. I would want the truck to be used for transportation. We would probably work with a nonprofit, so that they would have to be approved to use the truck. That is the only way that I could think of to do it. We are very cautious about where we would donate the truck. My husband and I don't know how long we would have it. We would donate it for a specific time period. We are pretty smart people and we don't need the truck. We know that we would be able to get more than the price we paid for the truck out of it. We could use the money for other things that we are doing.\n\n\n\nMy husband has thought about finding a newer truck that doesn't need to be fixed up. He has thought about putting a little addition on the back to hold a bed. The bed would be the only part of the truck that needed to be fixed up. We have talked about taking this truck and fixing it up and then donating it. I am not sure how we would go about it though.\n\n\n\nThe truck that we saw last weekend is worth at least $3000.00. It has a V8 engine. It does need to be fixed up a little bit, but it is not worth that much money. We looked it up and it was only worth $2500.00. We could probably get it for $2000.00 if we fixed it up. It has not been registered in years, so we would have to get that straightened out. It has power windows, which is really neat. It has a sunroof. It is a really nice truck and it is in good condition. It is not the kind of truck that is really worth buying and fixing up. My husband thought that we could buy it, but I didn't want to go that far. My husband is not used to looking at vehicles like this. I know that he could use it for the business. My husband is a contractor, so he could use it to haul tools and such around.\n\n\n\nIf you can help us figure out what kind of license we need to operate the truck in our state, we would really appreciate it. I am going to look online and see if I can find something out. It would be a lot of work, but it would be worth it. We just don't want the families to take advantage of us. I don't know how we could help with that.\n\n\n\nWe would be willing to spend $500.00 on the truck. It needs some minor work. It is still a nice truck though. We thought we could add a dump bed to it. The bed is the only part that needs to be fixed up. It has a roll down door, so we could even use it to haul things around. It is a great truck.\n\n\n\nI would love to talk to you about this some more. My husband has already done a lot of the research on this. He thinks it would be a great project for us to take on. We have had a lot of health problems lately, so we have not had the time to really look into it.\n\n\n\nI really hope that you can help us. This is an exciting opportunity. I know that you will be able to help us figure out how to operate a truck in our state. I know that we will be able to get the license. We will probably need to get a company name, so that we can register the truck. We are looking forward to talking with you about this.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary<|endoftext|>This week, Leonie and Rachel are doing things they have not done before: reading a thriller with their daughters. While the girls are out of school, they take a break from picture books to read some chapters of THE SCIENCE OF HUGGING with their respective five and three year olds. With its lovely illustrations and captivating illustrations of animals, trees, insects, and a variety of other things, the book provides a great introduction to science.\n\nIt was an absolute joy to see the girls absorb the information, ask the right questions, and share their thoughts with their moms about what they were reading.\n\nTo learn more about the book, read on for our interview with the author, Johanna Kindvall.\n\nDid you have a childhood favorite book?\n\nAs a child, I loved the “Little House on the Prairie” series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I also loved the animal books by J.H.Hutchinson, such as “Are you an Elephant?” and “Are you a Bear?”\n\nWhat is your book about?\n\nIn this book, I show the science of hugging. Hugging is the act of embracing someone in a caring way. Hugging is a common way to express caring and affection. This book discusses many different types of hugging, from the ways that trees and flowers hug each other, to the ways that animals hug each other. I also discuss why we hug, how hugging can help our health, and the different feelings that we experience while we hug.\n\nTell us about a typical day in your writing life?\n\nI write every day. If I am not writing, I am thinking about writing. I have a lot of ideas for new books. I think about ideas and jot down notes. Sometimes I write at my computer, other times I write in my journal. I usually write from 8am-12pm, and then I go back to work.\n\nWhy did you write the book?\n\nI wanted to write a book about hugging. I was thinking about what kind of information about hugging would be most interesting to share with children, and I realized that we really do not know a lot about the science of hugging.\n\nDo you have an interesting story about writing the book?\n\nIt was so fun to illustrate this book, because I was able to illustrate a variety of different types of hugging. When I made the book I tried to hug a tree for the cover illustration. The hardest hug to illustrate was a bear hug. I had to really think about how I could draw a bear hug, and how I would express that the bear was hugging with his claws.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of the book?\n\nI love my cover illustration, because it shows so many different types of hugging. I also really like the science of hugging pages, because I was able to show the different ways that science can be used to understand hugs.\n\nWhat is your favorite picture in the book?\n\nI like the two pages that show how different types of hugging affect our bodies. I was able to illustrate the heart and lungs, and it was a lot of fun to make those illustrations.\n\nWhere can people purchase your book?\n\nThis book can be purchased on Amazon.\n\nWho is your favorite author?\n\nI really enjoy reading books by Linda Sue Park and Peter Brown.\n\nThanks to Johanna for sharing about her book."

The charity worked with Artrix to include a programme of interactive workshops that took place on the Friday of the festival. The workshops engaged in conversations about art, music and philosophy. They also introduced the young people to musicians and performers, who in turn shared their knowledge about their own experiences in music and how it has influenced their own journey.\n\nOne of the workshops encouraged the young people to experiment with a variety of instruments and create an original composition. Another workshop, which explored the different genres of classical music, demonstrated how the young people could use their creative thinking to connect with other styles of music. The young people also engaged in philosophical discussions about music and life. They learned about the difference between performing music and listening to music, and they discussed what a performance is.\n\nLinton Brook’s involvement in the festival led to a strong working relationship with the festival organisers, who have expressed their interest in building a lasting relationship with the charity. This will mean Linton Brook can look at other ways it can collaborate with the festival to benefit more young people and their communities.\n\nFind out more about Linton Brook and the work that they do by visiting the website.<|endoftext|>Louisville Criminal Attorney - Official Site\n\nAfter the completion of trial, or other form of sentencing, the most important task of the criminal defense lawyer is the preparation of a detailed written narrative of what took place during the course of the case and the reasons for the verdict.

In the current outbreak, the strain of E. coli identified by the CDC as causing infections in both people and animals is a strain that produces a Shiga toxin known as STX2. In November, 19 people became ill in the USA and Canada.\n\nSo far, the CDC is not identifying a grower, supplier, distributor or brand that is linked to the outbreak.\n\nHealth officials have warned that the cases of E. coli may not be over, and people should still be on the lookout for symptoms.\n\nAlthough authorities have not pinpointed a specific grower, distributor or brand, the CDC has warned that all types of romaine lettuce should be avoided.\n\nOther advice includes properly washing and sanitizing produce to reduce the risk of illness.\n\nThe FDA is working with state and local officials and conducting inspections in the growing regions and in packing facilities to determine the source of contamination.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli can range from mild to severe, and usually appear within two to eight days of consuming the contaminated food.\n\nCases have been reported in Canada and 13 states. The patients have required hospitalization and one patient has died.\n\nPossible E. coli contamination in bagged and chopped romaine lettuce has sickened at least 15 people in NY and New Jersey, according to the CDC.\n\nThat's what can be expected in the aftermath of E. coli outbreaks that have been linked to fresh produce, says Lawrence Goodridge, director of the Washington State Department of Health's Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Program. \"I think in some cases, if you don't have irrigation, you have to go through the issue of what's the most you can do\".<|endoftext|>Gambling Behavior and Behavior Control\n\nby Barbara L. Milrod, Ph.D.\n\nRecreational gambling, especially casino gambling, is a growing and significant industry in the United States. A growing number of families engage in some form of gambling as a leisure activity. A sizeable number of families visit a casino at least once a year. Increasing numbers of families engage in forms of gambling that do not require visits to a casino, but do require some type of Internet or computer connection. Families that are not recreational gamblers are likely to include at least one person who is a gambler, a gambler who also functions in some other major role in the family, such as as a spouse, parent, sibling, or grandparent. Therefore, even if gambling is not a regular family leisure activity, it is a part of life for a significant number of families.\n\nGiven that, how does the gambling industry want the public to think about gambling and its impact on families? How should the public be thinking about it? What impact does it have on families? What are some of the causes and symptoms of gambling-related problems?\n\nThe 2005 National Gambling Impact Study Commission, the most recent of a series of gambling impact studies, reported that the number of people who engage in some form of gambling each year has increased since the last study. In the most recent study, it was estimated that approximately 21% of the adult population has engaged in some form of gambling at least once during the course of a year.\n\nThe study found that while the majority of the population gambles for entertainment purposes, a smaller but significant minority gambles for money and may be at risk for developing a gambling problem.\n\nThe study also reported that most people are either unaware of the nature of pathological gambling or misperceive its prevalence. A significant minority of the population does not believe that pathological gambling exists or that it exists only in a relatively small percentage of the population.\n\nEven in cases where the public recognizes that gambling is a problem for some, the impact of gambling on family members is often minimized. Therefore, the topic of gambling and its impact on family members has become a popular topic among researchers and is the subject of several studies.\n\nFor example, Blaszczynski and McConaghy reported that most of the relatives of pathological gamblers and problem gamblers had been affected by the gambling and had been directly affected by the adverse financial consequences.\n\nThey also reported that the relatives of pathological gamblers had significantly more dysfunction in their lives than the relatives of the problem gamblers. Additionally, they found that there was a significantly greater prevalence of gambling in the relatives of the pathological gamblers.\n\nWilliams and colleagues also reported that pathological gambling had a negative impact on the families of pathological gamblers. In that study, the spouses of the pathological gamblers were most likely to report problems in their marriage. These problems included financial difficulties, difficulties with communication, and issues with dealing with the gambling.\n\nGiven that, we might ask ourselves how does this impact families?\n\nIn terms of family interactions and dynamics, gambling can affect families in many ways. Family members may be affected in different ways. Family members may also be affected at different levels. For example, some family members may not be impacted very much at all. Others may be affected more severely. Family members may also be affected in a way that is either beneficial or detrimental. For example, they may be affected in a way that is not particularly harmful to them, but does cause harm to others.\n\nLet's examine the impact of gambling on family members in more detail. First, let's take a look at the general impact on family members.\n\nThe Impact of Gambling on Family Members\n\nSome of the impact on family members may be similar to the impact that other problem behaviors, such as substance abuse, have on families. However, some aspects of the impact are also unique to gambling. Let's take a look at both the similarities and the differences.\n\nGeneral Impact\n\nIn general, the effects of gambling on family members can be broadly categorized into four major areas: financial impact, emotional impact, environmental impact, and cultural impact. These areas, and the individual effects within each area, are described below.\n\nFinancial Impact\n\nMost families in the United States struggle with money issues at some time during the course of their lives. Financial concerns can affect a family's ability to deal with other problems. They can also cause problems in and of themselves.\n\nWhen financial concerns arise as a result of gambling, family members may need to sacrifice other financial needs to meet the demands of the gambler. For example, the gambler may require family members to fund a large portion of his or her gambling activities. This may require the family to make difficult decisions about which expenses to cut back on or to borrow money.\n\nFamilies may also face financial difficulties as a result of the gambling of a member. For example, if a family member incurs debts or otherwise incurs financial problems as a result of gambling, the other family members may need to cover his or her debts. This can be costly.\n\nCultural Impact\n\nGambling in America has a long history. This history has influenced American society and culture in many ways. One way it has influenced American society is through the creation of \"gaming\" communities. These communities, which are primarily located in the western part of the United States, are based on gambling.\n\nGambling as a cultural activity has evolved over time, and has become a part of our culture and entertainment culture. As a result, there is now a certain level of expectation in American culture about recreational gambling.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nSome people believe that gambling in a casino is a more \"safe\" and \"controlled\" environment than recreational gambling in the home. While this may be true, there are some dangers to this type of environment. Casinos can sometimes be a location where crime and violence occur. Families who engage in this form of gambling, then, can be negatively impacted in a variety of ways by the environment in which they gamble.\n\nEmotional Impact\n\nEmotions play an important role in all aspects of life, including in families. The emotional impact of gambling is both obvious and subtle. It is both dramatic and subtle. Families and family members may react emotionally to the gambling of a family member.\n\nFamilies may also react emotionally in response to a gambling-related problem. Some family members may respond with fear or anxiety about the problem. Others may respond with shame, guilt, or embarrassment.\n\nThe emotional impact of gambling on a family can be quite extensive.

"20.12.2010\n\nLaser 4.0, EUROFORUM – The role of innovation in a period of crisis: Claudio Dematté: Online innovation: Increasing competition in the global economy requires flexible strategies.\n\nDuring the 7th edition of Laser 4.0, EUROFORUM – The role of innovation in a period of crisis, which took place on the 18th of November in Venice, Claudio Dematté discussed about “online innovation”, a concept increasingly adopted by companies with the aim to develop new business models.\n\n\n\nClaudio Dematté is Associate Professor of Management and Strategy at LUISS University. He has been coordinating the Communication Technology Laboratory at LUISS since 2007 and he has been a member of the Telecommunication Research Centre (C.T.R.) since 2008.\n\n\n\nClaudio Dematté is the author of articles on the topics of innovation, high technology and competition and he has also published several books.\n\n\n\nHis latest book, “Alla ricerca della tecnologia dei miracoli”, addresses the issue of competition in the information technology sector, analysing, in particular, the evolution of the competitive structure, new forms of alliances and companies’ business models.\n\n\n\nDuring his lecture, Claudio Dematté presented the results of his research on the technology sector, which demonstrate that the use of new technologies has not been a determining factor in the company’s performance in the last ten years, in particular as regards innovation.\n\n\n\nThis approach highlights the importance of developing innovative strategies based on collaborative alliances, and on an analysis of the local and international competitive scenario. The various steps of this analysis have the aim to understand how competitive pressure is affected by local and international factors, and to gain an overview of the innovative strategies adopted by the main players.\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the way in which innovations are being developed and commercialised in different sectors, Dematté carried out an analysis of the companies that are among the most innovative worldwide, together with their respective characteristics and with their distribution in different sectors.\n\n\n\nThe importance of online innovation is increasing. Analysing the phenomenon of e-commerce in detail, Dematté explained that the traditional retail models are losing ground to the new approaches and the new technology is driving companies towards a new vision of how to develop new products and services.\n\n\n\nThe use of the Internet has turned the e-commerce market into an increasingly competitive field, in which “follower strategies”, such as the launch of specific websites and of niche products, have become more common.\n\n\n\nOnline innovation is therefore a reality, however in order to make the most of this phenomenon companies have to develop a “strategic vision” of the e-commerce market.\n\n\n\nThe lecture of Claudio Dematté was followed by a panel discussion in which, among the other speakers, Giulio Tremonti, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Economy and Finances, took part.<|endoftext|>A man has been charged with the murder of a teenage girl whose remains were found near the A130 on Christmas Day.\n\nThe body of 14-year-old Bijal Patel was found at around 2pm in a wooded area in Thorpe Marriott, near the A130 interchange.\n\nBijal Patel, 14, was murdered in December (Picture: Archant)\n\nShe had last been seen on December 21 at a bus stop in the Mildenhall area, and a post-mortem examination found she died of multiple injuries.\n\nA 45-year-old man has now been charged with murder and will appear in court tomorrow.\n\nInspector Sam Cavale said: ‘This is a very tragic and upsetting incident that has caused much distress to Bijal’s family, the community and local emergency services.\n\n‘I’d like to thank those people for their help and support. I also want to thank members of the public who have provided information so far, which has proved vital in the investigation.’\n\nPolice are still searching for a ‘light coloured’ Vauxhall Zafira or Ford Galaxy, registration plates M474 WNN, after it was seen in the area of the bus stop where the teenager was last seen on December 21.<|endoftext|>2 weeks ago\n\nThis was the panel I had the pleasure of moderating for #TALCON18 #space #alzheimers today.

State and local agencies, not the CDC, are responsible for drug-treatment programs, policing, and other areas of opioid response. And when it comes to administering Medicaid, states also have the lead role.\n\nFor this reason, CDC's success hinges on the agencies it funds, especially state health departments.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest obstacles to reducing opioid overdose deaths, and how CDC can address them.\n\nStates can't take on the opioid epidemic alone\n\nAmerica has a crisis on its hands. Opioid overdoses killed more than 42,000 people in 2016, and a July report from the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis noted that overdose deaths are \"expected to keep rising.\"\n\n\"We have to figure out a way to prevent the unintended consequences of our good intentions,\" said D'Onofrio.\n\nIn other words, the public-health responses to the opioid epidemic, from addiction treatment to education campaigns, are having a variety of unintended consequences.\n\nTo address them, experts say the CDC needs to support the state and local agencies, such as health departments and medical schools, that will be at the front lines of the response.\n\n\"CDC has a responsibility to provide resources and expertise to state and local health departments,\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).\n\nVolkow said the agency should focus on supporting states with developing evidence-based strategies for reducing opioid overdoses, expanding treatment, and improving pain management.\n\n\"We know that there are tools out there,\" she said. \"But it takes the CDC and NIDA working together to identify them, develop them, and help distribute them.\"\n\nIt's not just about access to treatment\n\nIn the midst of the worst drug crisis in US history, it's easy to believe that all the country needs is more treatment to curb opioid addiction.\n\nBut experts say it's not just about access to treatment.\n\n\"The CDC has to provide help to states and communities in building up their capacity to respond to this epidemic,\" said Dr. Jon Zibbell, chief of the Bureau of Epidemiology at the Pennsylvania Department of Health.\n\nTo do that, Zibbell said the agency needs to create a national, standardized system to track the crisis — including the spread of heroin, fentanyl, and prescription drugs.\n\nCDC also needs to provide guidelines for evidence-based treatments, Zibbell said, and train a workforce to deliver them.\n\nZibbell said that the opioid crisis is different from previous drug epidemics, like HIV and hepatitis, because it is widespread, affecting every age group and gender. And unlike previous drug epidemics, it is not driven by a specific drug like cocaine or crack, but by the opioid class of drugs.\n\nSo, unlike other drug crises, Zibbell said, the opioid epidemic is not tied to any particular place or population, or the supply of a certain drug.\n\nAnd because the crisis has been going on for so long, the country needs CDC support to build up local expertise and respond.\n\n\"There's no way around it,\" Zibbell said. \"The best thing for CDC to do is support local, state, and territorial health departments.\"\n\nFocusing on the health of the general public is also important\n\nThe opioid epidemic has put a spotlight on the harm opioids do to people who use them. But D'Onofrio says it's also important to remember that these drugs"

I love the chocolate creme pie!\n\nCoconut Cream Pie\n\nSalted Caramel Cookie\n\nI love all of these pies!\n\nChocolatier Biscuit Open Mic Night\n\nThe Chocolatier Biscuit is located on 1st street in Hoboken right across the street from New York Seltzer. It is a small store that seems to only have seating for about 15 people and is a bit cramped. The owners do not serve any alcohol, but you are allowed to bring your own and have it with your food. The store has been around for a while, but in the past year has added a weekend lunch menu. I came here for their Open Mic night on Thursday night. I found out about this Open Mic night from OpenMic.com . This website has a list of all the Open Mic nights around the world, which is cool because I go to a lot of them in NYC. There are three things that make me fall in love with a store, yummy chocolates, yummy food, and a community vibe. This store has two of those things. When you walk into this store you instantly get a chocolate vibe. The store has a plethora of chocolate options, which are amazing, and they even have a chocolate museum (open only for select times). I just ordered a few chocolate covered truffles and some chocolates for my family for Christmas.The owner of the store, Bruce, came to talk to us about his store, and the Open Mic. I asked him what is their favorite pie. He said it is the coconut cream pie, which they make fresh daily, so it is the best one. I also asked him why they don't serve alcohol. He told me that his wife does not like alcohol, and since they have three kids, they have to make sure to keep it G rated. This is cool since I am the same way. I like having fun with my friends, but I don't want my children exposed to things they shouldn't be exposed to.The Open Mic is run by Bruce's daughter Liz. She has done a great job at getting people to come to this event. I was surprised that this place was packed when I came. Usually Open Mic nights I go to are either dead, or have a small turnout. When I went to the Open Mic at Riverview Tavern , I was the only person there. That night Bruce was performing. He was singing Christmas songs with his guitar. He is a very talented musician. He can sing, and play the guitar, and is a great songwriter. He played a lot of good Christmas songs, but did not play anything I knew. Some people I know came by and I talked to them for a bit, while listening to Bruce play. I was not planning on staying long since I have been to a lot of Open Mic nights, but after a while, I was having so much fun listening to the people performing, that I decided to stay. I also talked to Liz, and Bruce's wife about the food and store.Bruce and Liz had a table set up with various pies and cakes to try. There were over 20 pies and cakes to try. I really wanted to try them all, but I was saving myself for a special birthday celebration later that night.I got to try some of their dessert plates. They had vanilla bean cake, orange cake, apple pie, and cream cheese squares. I really liked their vanilla bean cake. It was moist, and not dry like other vanilla cakes I have had. The cake had a vanilla flavor, but was not over powering. The orange cake had an orange flavor that was not over powering either. I really liked this cake as well. I am not sure which one I liked the best. I am also not sure which cake was made at the store, and which was not. All of their desserts looked amazing!The music that night was great! There was a lot of talent. Everyone was amazing, and I wish I had taken some pictures. I was too busy listening and enjoying myself. One person, Tom, stood out to me. He had a great voice, and his rendition of I just called to say I love you was a great choice. I also loved when he did a song with a bit of a rock vibe to it. He has great range, and is an amazing performer.After listening to the performers, it was time to go. I was very full and the pie was just too much to handle. Liz came by and asked if I wanted to have another piece of pie. I said yes and took home a piece of their chocolate creme pie, and a slice of the coconut cream pie. Their chocolate pie was amazing. It was rich and moist and tasted just like a Hershey's chocolate bar. They only had one slice of the coconut cream pie left, so I took it home. It was also amazing. It was so creamy and tasted like coconut. I don't even like coconut, but this pie was so good! It had a bit of a gelatin texture to it. This was one of the best pies I have ever had. I really love all of the pies I had here, and will be back for more. I also want to try their chocolate covered brownies, chocolate covered strawberries, and their brownies.This store has amazing food and desserts, and has a great vibe. I really enjoyed my time here and look forward to returning! I hope you enjoy your time here as well! I would love to hear from you!

Verified Purchase This jacket is lightweight, well designed and with plenty of pockets. The Goretex fabric does its job as it has to and seems to be durable. The size I ordered is a bit too big but it still does the job well and I have plenty of room for extra layers. The fabric has a nice 'stretch' in it so you can put it on easily even if it is a little bit large. The length of the sleeves and the torso is excellent, as I have shorter arms.\n\nI would highly recommend this jacket as a light duty waterproof. I would buy it again.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Great jacket Verified Purchase A great jacket, warm enough for the Scottish autumn, and room for extra layers underneath. The sleeves are long enough, and the pockets are deep enough, even when wearing gloves. The fabric seems to be very hard wearing and well made.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Lightweight and comfortable Verified Purchase I got this because it was described as 'running short', which seemed to be a reference to the short length, as opposed to it being for a runner. I wanted a wind/waterproof jacket which could be worn as a 'trousers-coat' on its own or over my normal jacket, so I was quite happy with the short length.\n\nIt is extremely lightweight and, despite its short length, very comfortable. It has two large pockets on the front and one in the centre, plus two pockets inside the front and two on the upper arms.\n\nI haven't worn it in really wet weather, but in light drizzle it seems to work well. It is obviously waterproof, but perhaps not warm enough to wear on its own in very cold or wet weather. However, worn over my normal coat it does provide adequate insulation for light rain or windy weather.\n\nI would certainly recommend this jacket, especially if you don't need it for extreme weather.\n\n4.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy and waterproof Verified Purchase Bought for my daughter to keep in her bag, so she would always have it with her, incase the weather turns, the jacket is light and waterproof, so no worries about her getting wet. The jacket looks smart and has plenty of room to put in extra layers underneath.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Very Good for the price Verified Purchase I am very pleased with this item. It is lightweight and keeps the wind and rain out. The length is also great for me (I'm 5'9\"). I was so impressed I bought one for my friend.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Liked this jacket Verified Purchase Nice jacket. I wore this jacket for quite some time. Its light but protective. Water proof but still comfortable when it gets warm. I had this jacket in grey and I will buy this jacket again when this one is worn out.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Ideal waterproof jacket Verified Purchase This jacket has just what I was looking for, at a really"
"Prof. Petitpas Taylor: Legalization Could Have Been Handled More “Artfully”\n\nLegalization of cannabis could have been handled more “artfully”, says a member of the federal government’s cannabis task force who is now Canada’s Minister of Health.\n\nIn an interview with the public broadcaster CBC, Ginette Petitpas Taylor said that the marijuana legalization bill as written could have been better.\n\nPetitpas Taylor said that the cannabis task force was not given the time to study legalization to its fullest extent, although it had sufficient time to make an impact on public health and safety. She added that the task force did not get sufficient time to consult with the provinces, although it tried to do so.\n\nSpeaking about the changes that were made to the original bill, she said, “It could have been done more artfully and more in-depth.”\n\nShe explained that legalization “has been going on for a while in many provinces” and the Canadian public was already aware of cannabis. She added that it was known that the Government was moving toward legalizing cannabis. “So, we should have had more time to consult with Canadians and the provinces on these issues.”\n\nSpeaking about the implementation of the legislation, Petitpas Taylor said, “We were moving on an aggressive time frame and there were certain things we were unable to address to the extent we would have wanted.”\n\nPetitpas Taylor said that one of the things she would have liked to see in the legislation is the ability to make rules around edible marijuana, something that will come in July 2019.\n\nShe also said that it would have been good to have had rules that “regulate advertising and marketing” so that it was appropriate. “You want to make sure that it’s not promoting the use of this to children.”\n\nShe added that as a parent of two teenagers, she was keen on seeing this as a parent.\n\n“As a parent, I want to make sure that we have the regulations in place, to make sure we are protecting children,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Quebec government has decided to raise the legal age for cannabis use to 21 from 18. The province also said it will not allow the use of marijuana in the presence of children. The province said it would allow its citizens to smoke marijuana only in private homes.\n\nIn its law on marijuana, Quebec will only allow cannabis to be grown in a residence and will not permit its purchase in stores.\n\n(Featured image by Guschenkova/Shutterstock.com)<|endoftext|>Barcelona will take on Juventus in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie on Tuesday, as the La Liga champions look to make it back-to-back European trophies.\n\nBarcelona\n\nForm: FC Barcelona have had a mixed season in La Liga, sitting in third place in the table, 15 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, and a point off second-placed Valencia.\n\nHowever, they still have the chance to win their seventh La Liga title in eight years and are in the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao. The Catalans have been victorious in nine of their 11 European matches this season, but were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atletico.\n\nKey player: It will take an outstanding performance from one of the stars of the Catalan club for them to overcome the Italian side. Lionel Messi is coming off his second Golden Shoe award in three years and has 18 league goals so far this campaign, the same number as Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nJuventus\n\nForm: Juventus are currently sitting top of Serie A, just two points ahead of Napoli with three games left. They have gone 29 matches without a defeat in the league this season, a run that stretches back to October.\n\nThe Old Lady have been eliminated from the Coppa Italia by AC Milan but are in the semi-finals of the Europa League against Benfica. Juventus beat Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League to make the last eight and are in their first Champions League quarter-final since 2006.\n\nKey player: Arturo Vidal, Alvaro Morata and Carlos Tevez all offer Juventus attacking prowess, but if they are to get past Barcelona, it will be thanks to the defensive work of Andrea Pirlo.\n\nThe veteran midfielder has been key in Juve’s run to the quarter-finals, and while he may not score the goals, his organisation of the team will be vital in the coming weeks.\n\nRecent form\n\nBarcelona: DWWWWWWWW\n\nJuventus: WWWWWWW\n\nPossible lineups\n\nBarcelona: Valdes; Alves, Pique, Mascherano, Adriano; Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta; Neymar, Messi, Sanchez\n\nJuventus: Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini; Lichtsteiner, Pirlo, Vidal, Pogba, Marchisio; Tevez, Morata\n\nSports Mole says: 1-1 (5-4 on aggregate)<|endoftext|>The Rolling Stones bring more than half a century of hits to their “On Air” tour, which is currently hitting arenas around the U.S. For more than 50 years, the legendary rock band has been able to maintain a top-notch musical prowess and prolific discography, despite several hiatuses and several breakups.

The band formed in 1962 and is still touring today. The band members are Charlie Watts, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, and Ronnie Wood. These five individuals, who had a very interesting start, are considered one of the most successful rock bands of all time. They have sold more than 200 million albums worldwide. They are also credited as one of the greatest live acts in music history.\n\nThe Rolling Stones began their career as a pop and R&B cover band. They also incorporated jazz elements in their music. They achieved worldwide fame with their hit single “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.” It has since become one of the most recognizable and classic rock songs in music history. They followed the song with the equally popular “Paint it Black” in 1966. Other great songs in the 1960s include “Get Off My Cloud,” “19th Nervous Breakdown,” “Mother’s Little Helper,” “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” and “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.”\n\nFollowing a lengthy break from touring, The Rolling Stones returned to the road in 1982. In 1986, the band played what is believed to be their final show at the Altamont Speedway in California. The concert has since become a notorious case study in cultural history and has been regarded as the moment that led to the end of the “Summer of Love” in the United States.\n\nThe band’s success was not limited to its early years. The Rolling Stones have released numerous hits throughout the 1990s and 2000s, including “Start Me Up,” “Brown Sugar,” “Wild Horses,” “You Got Me Rocking,” “Can’t You Hear Me Knocking,” “Miss You,” “Paint It Black,” “Honky Tonk Woman,” and “Under My Thumb.” In 2004, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Rolling Stones remain a popular act on the road. They have been on tour in recent years and have scheduled more concert dates for 2016. They will be playing the Starplex Pavilion in Dallas, the Fiddlers Green Amphitheatre in Englewood, the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, and the Sleep Train Amphitheatre in Chula Vista. They have been invited to play in arenas, stadiums, and even stadiums as a guest band. They have won several awards, including 12 Grammy awards. The band has had many successful albums, including “Sticky Fingers,” “Tattoo You,” “Some Girls,” “Beggars Banquet,” and “Exile on Main St.”\n\nThe Rolling Stones are certainly one of the most important rock bands in music history. They have contributed significantly to the development of rock music and set an example of success for other bands.

As far as I understand it, you take points away from the PC's overall score if they do certain things. This works for most things, but I have a problem with how it works with imprisonment.\n\n\n\nLet's say that I am in a situation where I could be imprisoned. I choose not to and stay free. The Referee informs me that my score is reduced. I get it, I lose some points. But the next time I get arrested, I'm still scoring 0 because the first time I was arrested was when my score was still 100.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to correct this or is it an intentional part of the system that it doesn't take into account the situation that you already had to get arrested for the first time?\n\nGive us a bell if you are coming to GenCon!

It also means Government collects a little less revenue.\" Finance Minister Bill English said.\n\nRNZ Business Editor Rob Hosking said the measure has been extended, but the new land tax will not come into effect until 2018.\n\n\"Land tax will only apply to 'under-occupied' homes, defined as any house or apartment that's unoccupied for more than six months of the year, in which case the owner will have to pay tax on it as though they were renting it out,\" he said.\n\n\"At the moment there are approximately 41,000 vacant houses in Auckland - and that's without counting holiday homes, which would push that number higher.\"\n\nBanks and real estate companies are predicting prices will continue to rise.\n\n\"The Auckland housing market has been in a state of severe imbalance for some time now, with demand outstripping supply, which is pushing house prices higher and making it difficult for first-home buyers to enter the market,\" said Peter Thompson, head of New Zealand for ANZ.\n\n\"The [bright line] tax has been a step in the right direction, and should help to moderate house price inflation over time.\n\n\"But the tax is unlikely to have a significant impact on the market over the next 12 months. More needs to be done.\"\n\nMike Alexander of real estate agency Barfoot and Thompson said the measures had helped reduce speculation.\n\n\"The Government's recent housing market measures have had a positive impact on the Auckland housing market,\" he said.\n\n\"As an example, prior to the first round of measures, the average sale price in Auckland was increasing at around 15 percent per annum. Since the introduction of the measures, prices have moderated to around 3 percent.\n\n\"The Government has been very clear that they are looking to deliver a long-term solution to housing affordability, and we are looking forward to engaging with them on what we can do to support this over the coming months.\"\n\nFinance Minister Bill English said the measures would not prevent further gains in the housing market.\n\n\"I can't say there's no risk of a bubble forming, but they're good, targeted, temporary measures, with a view to lifting the proportion of first home buyers in Auckland,\" he said.\n\nThe measures were due to expire in October, but were extended after consultations with the Reserve Bank and the Treasury.<|endoftext|>| Feeds The latest issue of WWE Magazine is now online.

Four of SmackDown’s top stars will participate in the first ever match for the Elimination Chamber. Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, Edge, and Eddie Guerrero will compete for the right to face Triple H for the WWE Championship at Wrestlemania. The first ever Elimination Chamber will take place inside the Raw set. The Elimination Chamber consists of six chain-linked pods that will enclose each of the Superstars. The structure is approximately 60 feet high, 35 feet wide and weighs about 15,000 pounds. The pods are three feet wide and six feet tall and are composed of steel. The pods will be locked in the ringside area of the Raw set by two large hydraulic cams. Each pod contains a television monitor that will allow the Superstars to monitor what is happening in the match. The pods will be illuminated to allow fans at home to see the action inside. The pods will also be accessible by large trap doors which will be controlled by a floor director, ensuring that when they are opened, the Superstars inside the pods will not be tipped over. The Elimination Chamber was designed by WWE.com editor R.D. Reynolds and a team of engineers. The concept was first suggested to WWE by R.D. Reynolds in December, 2001. “We were sitting in the WWE.com war room discussing ideas for No Way Out,” says Reynolds. “I knew the Elimination Chamber match was a very real possibility, and I suggested to Vince McMahon that we do something to make it stand out. Vince thought the idea was great, and here we are.” “What was great about the opportunity,” says Reynold, “is that we were not just asked to build something. We were given the freedom to really create a unique environment that could provide for the best viewing experience for our fans. I knew what the WWE was looking for, so the team worked very closely to create a structure that would support the weight of the pods, the Superstars, and the hydraulics while allowing them to easily get out of the pods and to safety.” “We want this Elimination Chamber to be the best the WWE has ever put on,” says WWE Production Coordinator Andy Shepard. “And we are confident that we will accomplish this with the design we have put together. We have tested the pods, and the ability to raise and lower them into the ring. There will be no problem with getting the Superstars in and out of the pods. It’s an amazing and innovative design.” The pods will be constructed in the Raw set by R.D. Reynolds and the WWE.com Engineering team. The pods will be lifted from the ringside area of the set to the ceiling, where the ringside crew will place them into the chains. “The pods are surprisingly light,” says Reynolds. “It’s a lot of work for one man to lift them, but with six men, it is very possible. And the ringside crew will not have any problem.” “When the pods are dropped,” says Shepard, “they will remain exactly where we want them to. It’s not like they will fall from the ceiling. They will be perfectly placed to complete the structure.” The Elimination Chamber will be a steel structure approximately 15 feet high. “The pods and the chamber will be constructed of steel,” says R.D. Reynolds, “which makes it even more amazing that the Superstars will be able to lift it from the ringside area of the set to the ceiling. It is no easy feat.” “It’s not just the weight of the pods and structure that makes it difficult,” says Shepard. “We also have to consider the ceiling of the Raw set. It is about 20 feet from the floor to the ceiling. So, the Superstars will not be able to simply walk the pods to the ceiling. There will be a few creative ways to get the pods up there.” WWE Production Coordinator Andy Shepard has worked with the company since 1992. He has worked on the crew for several pay-per-views and TV shows, including ECW and SmackDown. “This is going to be an exciting match,” says Shepard. “It will be something completely different from what the WWE Universe has ever seen. The fans at home and in the arena are going to be blown away. I know that is the goal of the WWE and everyone on the crew. We are all very excited about the opportunity to create something that no one else has ever seen before"

A Gallup poll, conducted on October 28, showed Obama holding a two percentage point lead over Romney.\n\nIf that translates to the polls, Obama would win by about two percentage points, not enough for him to win in the electoral college, and the outcome could depend on a handful of states in the key electoral college.\n\nIf Romney were to win by two percentage points, he would likely get the 270 electoral college votes required to be declared the winner.\n\nAn increasingly tough economic outlook and the fight over the fate of the health care law known as Obamacare are defining issues in the presidential race.\n\nObama came into office with an economy in free fall in 2009, but has seen the unemployment rate drop from 9.8 to 8.1 percent since he took office.\n\nRomney, meanwhile, has been pushing his experience as a former venture capitalist and his time as governor of a traditionally Democratic state as evidence of what he could do to create jobs as president.\n\nThe president was pushed to the center during his first term to tackle issues such as the budget deficit, tax reform, and immigration. But he is returning to the left-of-center platform of his first run for the White House in 2008, when he beat Senator John McCain of Arizona in the general election.\n\nThere are two television debates left before the November 6 election, one at the University of Denver and another in Florida.\n\nRecent presidential polls in swing states show Obama has an edge in Ohio, Virginia, Colorado and Iowa, but Romney is running close in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina.<|endoftext|>Rostock.

"Technorati Tag: main index, ipod, google, p2p, google book search, gbook, ebook, itunes, gbs, gbs author\n\nI've posted a few things about Google Book Search in the past. It's an important project and it's got huge potential, both good and bad. Google made news last week when they announced they'd begun scanning physical books. This is a pretty big deal for them. It could generate huge amounts of data, and they could sell this data to various places (like, maybe, Apple), and the revenue would help them to drive costs down for their users. But it might also turn out to be a huge boon for people wanting to make a buck off of their books. It could also, theoretically, provide readers with a better means to search for books that they can read on their computers, phones, and ipods. So, let's break this down into three camps:The IPod/Apple: They're going to release an iPod that lets you view (and possibly download) ebooks, but the iTunes Store will probably only carry ebooks that Apple wants you to have, since they don't want to deal with Amazon and its DRM (and Amazon, being that big, can just walk away from the whole ebook thing, really). They can make a deal with a huge company, but they'd have to do it on Apple's terms, or they could make a deal with a bunch of indie ebooks, which they can't control, and the numbers would be pretty small compared to the volume of sales.The Kindle: They already control the marketplace for ebooks on this platform, and have sold millions of Kindles already. I don't think this really affects them in any way, other than to make sure they're in control of the platform so they can dominate the ebook market.The New York Times and the other mainstream media outlets: They are really excited about the prospect of Google scanning millions of books. They can get some for free, and they can also scan some of the books they already have and make them available. But if they want to sell any, they'll have to get permissions, so it could be a while before that happens.So, this is the question: if Google is going to start selling books, how will they do it? Google, being Google, is likely to do something completely different, so they have the opportunity to make some great stuff happen, but it'll take some time, and they may not have a lot of patience. I really think this is a great project, but I have my doubts about it.<|endoftext|>I never really know if I am doing well or not.

All patients showed large improvements in neuropsychological functioning after administration of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam. They benefited from the drug, but with widely different underlying pathologies. This shows the need for using individualized treatment strategies. The possible role of genetic factors, mechanisms of action of levetiracetam, and possible side effects are discussed.\n\nNeuropsychological deficits are common in various psychiatric disorders and epilepsy. They often improve with treatment, but little is known about the efficacy and safety of the various treatment modalities.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA number of psychiatric disorders are characterized by neuropsychological deficits. Neuropsychological deficits may be seen in schizophrenia [1], mood disorders [2], obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [3], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [4], substance abuse [5], and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [6]. These neuropsychological deficits may arise from different pathophysiological mechanisms, and they are often described in terms of aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or impairment of cognitive processing.\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology of these neuropsychological deficits is complex. Deficits can be the result of many different disorders, including disease of the brain, neurodevelopmental disorders, disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS), or disorders that affect the body and are reflected in the CNS [7]. This is illustrated by the number of disorders in which neuropsychological deficits have been described (Table 1). In most patients, the neuropsychological deficits are caused by a combination of multiple different pathophysiological factors [7, 8].\n\nNeuropsychological deficits can occur with a variety of psychiatric disorders. When such deficits occur in epilepsy, there are specific cognitive deficits that are characteristic of the disorder [9]. When epilepsy occurs in combination with a psychiatric disorder, the cognitive deficits may be aggravated [9, 10]. When the psychiatric disorder itself involves cognitive deficits, they will also be aggravated. This will make the treatment of the underlying disorder more difficult. This will increase the risk of relapse, and may also increase the risk of cognitive deterioration.\n\nThe major types of treatments that are used for the various psychiatric disorders are listed in Table 2. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are one of the main forms of treatment for epilepsy. In the treatment of psychiatric disorders, especially when the psychiatric disorder is accompanied by neuropsychological deficits, AEDs are also frequently used. For these disorders, AEDs are often combined with psychotropic drugs. This leads to the question of whether AEDs may have a beneficial effect on neuropsychological functioning. Such an effect may improve the overall functioning of the patient.\n\nLevetiracetam is an AED that is registered in more than 50 countries and is licensed in the Netherlands as a monotherapy for the treatment of various types of epilepsy. It has been used in the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders. A recent review [11] found positive effects of levetiracetam on neuropsychological functioning in psychiatric patients with bipolar disorder and in a subgroup of depressed patients.\n\nBecause of the poor efficacy of the currently used treatment modalities, the search for new treatment strategies is ongoing. In particular, studies that investigate the possible therapeutic effects of AEDs are useful. In the treatment of epilepsy, there are various AEDs that may have specific effects on neuropsychological functioning [12]. The clinical effects of AEDs may depend on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that are present in a particular patient [8]. It is therefore possible that different types of AEDs have different effects on neuropsychological functioning. This may lead to a personalized treatment strategy for different patients. However, no such studies have been conducted.\n\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate the possible effects of levetiracetam on neuropsychological functioning in patients with different psychiatric disorders. The study focused on three major issues. First, it aimed to determine whether levetiracetam may have beneficial effects on neuropsychological functioning. Second, the efficacy of levetiracetam in different patient groups was compared. Third, the safety of levetiracetam was assessed.\n\nMETHODS\n\nSubjects\n\nThe study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands. All the patients were diagnosed at this center, and they all received treatment for their disorder(s). The following patient groups were included:\n\n1. Adults with bipolar disorder (n = 8)\n\n2. Adults with major depressive disorder (n = 6)\n\n3. Adults with OCD (n = 2)\n\n4. Adults with ADHD (n = 2)\n\n5. Adults with PTSD (n = 2)\n\n6. Adults with a variety of combinations of these disorders (n = 3)\n\nTable 1: Types of neuropsychological deficits in various psychiatric disorders.\n\nTable 2: Types of treatment for various psychiatric disorders.\n\nAll the patients were referred to the outpatient clinic because of their neuropsychological deficits. The patients were not selected on the basis of any specific criteria. All patients with a DSM-IV [13] diagnosis of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, OCD, ADHD, or PTSD were included. Patients with bipolar disorder I and II, major depressive disorder I and II, and ADHD were also included if they were under the age of 18 years. Patients with PTSD and patients with other combinations of psychiatric disorders were included. All patients were between the ages of 18 and 65 years and were either male or female.\n\nAll patients were included in a longitudinal study [14]. During the course of the study, some patients were added and others dropped out of the study. Therefore, the number of patients included in the study changed over time. All patients gave their informed consent for their data to be used in the study. All patients received treatment with levetiracetam for at least 2 months. The following patients received levetiracetam for more than 2 months: five patients with bipolar disorder, three patients with major depressive disorder, and two patients with OCD. Patients were included in the study if they received levetiracetam at an average dose of less than 3,000 mg/day. One patient with PTSD received levetiracetam at an average dose of 5,500 mg/day.\n\nPatient data\n\nThe data on the patients were obtained from the clinical files of the University Medical Center Groningen and the files of the pharmacies where the patients received their levetiracetam. In addition, the patients were seen by the authors at the University Medical Center Groningen. The clinical file data consisted of demographic"

It is our belief that imposing condom use in adult films would result in an increase in the number of people viewing adult films online.”\n\nAccording to the porn stars’ letter, “porn performers are more likely to be exposed to STIs than other workers” and they are tested regularly. The letter argues that there is no evidence that porn stars are exposed to a greater risk of HIV/AIDS than people in other industries and that the number of performers diagnosed with HIV or AIDS has been extremely low.\n\n“Our industry has been a model for safe sex in the workplace since its inception in the early 1970s,” the letter continues. “However, we feel that adding another layer of bureaucracy to our industry would be a disservice to our business, and the people who work in it.”\n\nThe bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Isadore Hall (D-Compton), would impose the condom mandate on all porn actors in the state of California. Violators would be fined up to $1,000 and could have their film licenses suspended or revoked.\n\n“While pornography is protected under the First Amendment, the adult film industry is subject to occupational safety and health standards like every other industry in the state,” Hall said in a statement. “[This bill] will help protect adult film performers from contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.”\n\nA spokesman for O’Brien declined to say whether or not the comedian, who hosted the MTV Music Awards on Sunday, will appear in a condom ad in California.<|endoftext|>Hindi literature\n\nWhen Delhi was ravaged by famine in the 16th century, many of its citizens fled north to towns such as Agra and Lucknow. Hindi literature in the classical form found its roots in the Bhakti movements of north India in the 16th century. Urdu literature has been cultivated with both influences and native traditions.\n\nThe colonial rule of the British Empire introduced English and western literature to India, and had the most profound impact on Hindi literature. In addition to the literature that evolved during the Mughal period, this period was also marked by the literary works of Bhakti saints.\n\nLike Persian, in Urdu also poetry played a central role. It was also the main language of the court, where Urdu was distinguished from Hindi by a heavy Persian vocabulary. The two developed a rich literary tradition with a profusion of prose genres and poetic forms. There are early Prakrit work of Dandin and Gunabhadra, an example for that Dandin was a Buddhist author and had done translation of sutras and sastras.\n\nIn South Asia, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Hindu nationalism in Hindi-speaking regions was expressed through the development of Hindi-language literature. During the 19th century, the Hindi literature developed the tradition of Dalit literature; works of B. In the 20th century, this tradition was carried forward by the Bhakti movement poets, in such notable works as Kabir and Amrita Pritam, the Western equivalent of which would be Whitman and Ginsberg.\n\nHindi literature is a formally recognized strand in the \"national literature\" of India. While India has several regional languages and traditions of literature, the \"national literature\" of India is written in Hindi.\n\nWhile Hindi is the official language of India, most literary works are written in regional languages. The prose works of the Bhakti Movement were originally written in various dialects of Hindi. The Awadhi dialect of Hindi has been influential in the development of Hindi prose, and most Hindi novels and short stories have been written in it.\n\nWith the translation of a large number of Western literary works in Hindi, there was a fresh impetus to the development of modern Hindi literature. This movement is called the Chhayavaad. One of the most prolific Hindi novelists was Premchand. Another great Hindi novelist was Munshi Premchand. An interest in Munshi Premchand's works among the wider populace has led to a resurgence in the popularity of his works. Other writers of the same era included Mahadevi Varma, Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Brijmohan Mishra, and Krishan Chander. The change in the Indian educational system, the literary taste of the people and the Hindi belt's growing cultural influence helped Hindi gain greater literary and socio-political popularity. Many Hindi writers belonging to this era are regarded as important figures in modern Indian literature.\n\nThe Anand family of novels is a sequence of novels by Munshi Premchand. The fictional village of Bawara in them is based on author's native town of Hamirpur.\n\nJai Arjun Singh (born in 1967) is an Indian Hindi fiction writer. He was a part of a modern generation of writers who were popular in the 1990s, along with Sachin Kundalkar, Krishna Sobti, etc. Singh has contributed short stories, novellas and novels in Hindi. He has received various awards, including the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Award for his work, both as a writer and editor. Singh's popularity as a Hindi writer was influenced by his early life in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAfter independence of India, the Hindi language has continued to grow in all Indian social sectors. Many Hindi writers and poets continued to write in the era of Independence.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru University is a prominent university in India, situated in New Delhi. JNU has produced a large number of important Hindi writers, including, among others, Vikram Seth, Mukul Kesavan, Gulzar, Harishankar Parsai, Anita Desai, Saadat Hasan Manto, Munshi Premchand, Acharya Chatursen, Dr. Pankaj Narayan, Bhisham Sahni, Amrita Pritam, Sumitranandan Pant, Satyajit Ray, Rajendra Yadav, Kedarnath Singh, Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar', Umashankar Joshi, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Vishnu Prabhakar, Ramesh Pangariya, Rajendra Keshavlal Dhandhale, Gopi Chand Narang, Vinay Bhargava, Brij Narayan, Chandrashekhar, Chaman Lal, Vimala Thakur and Prakash Swatantra Raju.<|endoftext|>There are a lot of men who get a tattoo of some nature and there are quite a few women that get them as well.

"Kolmetoista vuotta sitten kirjoitin tekstin, jossa pohdin, kuinka eduskuntatyö tukeutuu vahvasti päättäjien ja vaikuttajien muistikuviin.\n\nTutkimukseni osoitti, että yleisesti hyväksyttävä, demokraattisessa prosessissa muodostettu linja kirjoitetaan muistelun osaksi, jolloin sitä ei enää muuteta vaan se saa konkreettisen miehityksen: tästä tämä on lähtöisin, tämä on asia, jonka takia olemme käyneet tämän jälkeen.\n\nMuistelun muotoja ovat muun muassa arkistokuvia, historiallisia dokumentteja, kirjoituksia ja puheita.\n\nPäätöksenteon jälkiseurauksena nämä muistelut ovat vaikuttaneet erityisesti EU:n suhteen. Vuonna 2000 julkaistu euro-jäsenyyden kriisi sai hiljalleen muotonsa juuri muistelun kautta.\n\nEU:n hyväksyttävyyden ja nykyisten vaikeuksien välillä on luonteva yhteys.

Tutkimus onkin näillä näkymin tuottanut lukemattomia suomalaisia eurooppalaisia.\n\nKolmas mielenkiintoinen muistelo liittyy jäsenyyden neljännen vaiheen prosessiin. Siinä esimerkiksi yritysjohtajat tuomitsivat EU:n perustuslain arvot esimerkillisesti ja pitkästyneesti vuonna 2001.\n\nTuolloin oli merkkejä siitä, että EU:ta halutaan vähätellä muiden asioiden selän takana.\n\nMuistelu on nyt tehnyt tehtävänsä.

"SpaceX has been getting into the satellite-launching business. As CEO Elon Musk revealed, the company is planning to send its first operational satellites into space within the next couple of months.\n\nSpaceX already has two test satellites in orbit. The first is known as TinTin A and the second is TinTin B. The company has already tested the technology on these two devices, and will launch the first batch of satellites in a couple of months, and these will be in operation by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to The Verge, SpaceX has the go-ahead from the Federal Communications Commission to launch 4,425 satellites in low-Earth orbit. Musk explained that it would take seven launches of its Falcon 9 rocket to deploy all the satellites, and each launch would put up about 250 of them. Each satellite would weigh 250 pounds (110 kg), and SpaceX would use its Falcon 9 rocket for the launch.\n\nThe FCC has reportedly given SpaceX permission to launch more than 7,000 satellites in total, but the company will likely stop at 4,425 once the operational satellites are deployed.\n\nThe FCC already has approved another batch of satellites for SpaceX to launch. However, these will be in higher orbits, and the company will need special approvals from the International Telecommunications Union.\n\nSpaceX has already made arrangements with broadband Internet service providers to use its satellites once they are in orbit.\n\nThe company has said that its service will be “faster and cheaper” than other broadband options. Its service will be aimed at the U.S. at first, but it may eventually expand to other countries.\n\nSpaceX’s aim to bring high-speed broadband to more parts of the world will certainly be interesting to watch, but this may not be the only satellite-related announcement the company makes soon.\n\nAccording to reports, SpaceX is also planning to launch its Dragon 2 spacecraft to the International Space Station. This could happen as early as April 2019.\n\nThe Falcon 9’s launch will put a high-resolution imaging satellite, known as PAZ, into orbit. The spacecraft was built by the European aerospace and defense contractor, Airbus.\n\nThe company said that the launch will use the same rocket that will be used for the Falcon 9 carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft to the ISS next month.\n\nWith the Falcon 9’s payload fairing, the spacecraft will be about 11 feet (3.3 meters) in diameter.<|endoftext|>Most readers were up in arms when DC Comics spoiled the ending of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice by including it on the cover of the movie's official soundtrack. That's especially since the actual soundtrack listing, which featured most of the score by composer Hans Zimmer, didn't include a sample of the song at all.\n\nWell, now fans can finally listen to a sample of that cover and get a better idea of what the soundtrack may offer. The cover song was recorded by Gary Clark Jr., and while it's pretty good, it's definitely missing something.\n\nAfter that fateful sequence in the movie, you'd think the song would feel more emotionally impactful, but instead it just feels hollow and shallow. It's not terrible, but the soundtrack version of the song isn't quite as strong as the cover version of the song.\n\nThe thing is, the song is actually pretty good, and it's fitting for the movie and doesn't feel out of place. However, because it doesn't fit the tone of the movie or soundtrack, it just doesn't sound like it belongs.\n\nIt's not like other DC films and scores, and doesn't mesh well with what fans have come to expect from DC's superhero movies. Granted, the movie isn't exactly like other DC films, and there's no way to predict what people would come to expect.\n\nThe movie is full of fun and action, so it's only fitting that the score reflects that and that it has a big, loud, rock 'n' roll sound. If it had an emotional and subdued soundtrack, it wouldn't be a good fit for the movie or the characters.\n\nWhile Zimmer may have done an excellent job with the music in the movie, it's not necessarily the best soundtrack or music that fits the film. Not that it was his fault or that it was his decision, but the movie's soundtrack is definitely lacking.\n\nThis is because they were trying to keep the movie as secretive as possible, and didn't want anyone to know what the ending was going to be.\n\nIn all honesty, it's not necessarily a bad idea, and most people don't care about the soundtrack anyway. It was the choice of song that people took issue with, and for good reason.\n\nThat said, it doesn't change the fact that the song is pretty good, and it's actually one of the better songs on the soundtrack, which doesn't say much for it.\n\nFor those who haven't seen the movie, the song is one of the more emotional songs on the soundtrack. It's also the first one that plays, and it's used to set the tone of the movie, which is definitely a major part of the movie.\n\nIn the beginning of the movie, when Bruce Wayne is discussing Superman with Alfred, he says, \"They’ll fight. They’ll kill. And when it’s over, the world will be broken. We have to stop them.\"\n\nAnd then the song kicks in with a pretty sad tune, almost as if Bruce is predicting the future. It's an emotional and heavy song that sets the tone for the rest of the movie, and it fits the mood perfectly.\n\nIn the beginning, Clark Jr. is just talking about fighting, and while it sounds fine, it lacks the raw emotion and angst that the song needed to convey.\n\nWhen Clark sings, \"They’ll fight. They’ll kill. And when it’s over, the world will be broken,\" the lyrics don't sound like they have any emotion or that the artist is really singing them. They just sound like he's repeating what's in the song without any real feeling behind it.\n\nIn the soundtrack version, Clark sounds like he's trying to convey emotion and feeling, and he sounds like he's actually singing the song instead of just reciting it.\n\nWhile the soundtrack version is much more emotional and powerful, the soundtrack version is just not as well done as the cover version. It's still one of the better songs on the soundtrack, but the difference in emotion and quality is quite noticeable.\n\nHopefully, the cover version isn't the final version of the song, and there will be an official version of the soundtrack that includes more of the score, and hopefully that version of the song.\n\nEither way, the movie is still amazing, and fans will just have to deal with what they get when the soundtrack is released.\n\nBatman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is now playing in theaters.<|endoftext|>There are probably a lot of family members in your life that are into DIY projects.

In Arizona, for example, the monthly premium for a 27-year-old purchasing a silver plan would go from $208 a month under the Affordable Care Act to $277.41 under the Senate's version of Trumpcare.\n\nAccording to CAP, the \"modest\" subsidies included in the bill — ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 — would do little to protect Americans from soaring premiums. They note that the $2,000 subsidy would cover just a quarter of the premium cost for the average individual with an annual income of $28,000, leaving the individual on the hook for $6,500.\n\n\"Subsidies in the Senate bill are woefully inadequate for low- and middle-income Americans, and actually leave many people with higher costs and worse coverage,\" said Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at CAP, and a former top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama.\n\nTrumpcare is intended to lower premiums for younger, healthier Americans by slashing Medicaid, eliminating subsidies for insurance purchased on the individual market, and allowing insurers to charge older customers more for coverage.\n\nBut while premiums for young people may decrease, they are likely to go up substantially for older people, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office released on Monday.\n\n\"Older people are going to have to pay a heck of a lot more,\" an anonymous insurance industry source told Axios. \"I don't think the math works.\"<|endoftext|>A man who had been charged in connection with the shooting of a Douglas County deputy during a traffic stop was found dead in his cell early Tuesday, officials said.\n\nMatthew Riehl, 37, was found unresponsive in his cell at the Denver Detention Center at about 3:45 a.m., a spokeswoman for the Denver Department of Safety said in a news release.\n\nHe had been alone in his cell when he was found and did not have any other inmates in the cell with him, said Daelene Mix, the spokeswoman.\n\nRiehl had been arrested on Dec. 31 after a shooting at Copper Canyon Apartments, 9700 E.

Turkey blames Gülen, a former ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his followers for orchestrating the attempt to overthrow the government.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday banned academics from travelling abroad and suspended 13,000 police officers over suspected links to the Gülen movement, according to a decree published in the government’s official gazette.\n\nTurkey also issued an arrest warrant for the US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt, state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nThe interior ministry published a decree to “ban the travel of academics who are suspected of terrorist links” and to “close the Turkish border to academics who are abroad and suspected of terrorist links”.\n\nIt also ordered the suspension of more than 13,000 police officers over suspected links to the Gülen movement.\n\nSince the July 15 coup attempt, Turkish authorities have arrested 40,000 people and have suspended or dismissed more than 100,000, including soldiers, police officers, teachers and public servants.\n\nAnkara has been angered by Washington’s failure to hand over US-based cleric Gülen. The US says Turkey lacks sufficient proof of his alleged involvement in the failed coup.\n\nThe rector of Istanbul University, Suleyman Demirel, and former Istanbul governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu were among those sacked from their jobs.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey’s EU minister, Ömer Çelik, said that Ankara is not backing down from its demand for the extradition of Gülen.\n\nThe 75-year-old cleric lives in self-imposed exile in the US state of Pennsylvania.\n\n“It is Turkey’s right to demand the extradition of the leader of a terrorist organisation,” Çelik said in a speech to a parliamentary commission in Ankara. “There is no change in our stance.”\n\nEuropean Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday that Turkey was a valued member of the EU and its prospects of joining the bloc were not “taboo”.\n\nBut he added that Ankara should not overreact to the coup attempt or its aftermath.\n\nThe US and EU"

I knew I wanted one of the new style so I checked out the Walmart website to see what they had. I found this little gem. It had great reviews and was much cheaper than the ones they sell at the RV stores. I bought this model for $44.86. It works great! You can control the temperature and time for each setting. It heats stuff up super fast. It is nice and compact. It also looks good. I bought this one over the Nutone model because I liked the shape of it better and because of the longer warranty (1 year vs. 6 months). The one I bought is stainless steel. The one they sell in stores is black. The manual is kind of flimsy. You don't really need it. The control panel is all touch so you just touch the options on the touch screen. It takes a little getting used to but not bad at all. Overall, I am very pleased with this microwave. If you need a small microwave and don't want to spend a lot of money, you should buy this one.<|endoftext|>Title: Remember Me?\n\nAuthor: mistymidnight\n\nSummary: Buffy's getting all those amazing visions she got in the Mayor's office, only they're getting more specific… Now if only she could remember how to use them.\n\nRating: T\n\nDisclaimer: The characters you recognize are the property of Joss Whedon, Mutant Enemy, and various networks. The rest are mine.\n\nFeedback: Please. Good or bad, I'd like to hear it.\n\n\"So what's the plan?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nBuffy lowered her hand from her face. She and Xander were sitting in his car. She'd just come back from the doctor. She thought that she was finally remembering how to act like a normal human being. She thought that she was finally remembering how to feel like a normal human being.\n\nXander touched her shoulder. \"What did the doctor say?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" Buffy shrugged. \"They didn't do a thing. They were just doing a routine check-up.\"\n\n\"Checking up on you, huh?\"\n\nBuffy frowned. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"No, come on, Xander. Say what you want to say. This is why I don't like talking to you.\"\n\nXander flinched and started the car. \"Sorry. It's nothing.\"\n\n\"What do you think they're really doing? Do you think they're trying to find a way to get Spike and Dru out of my head?\"\n\n\"I doubt it.\" Xander's voice was soft. \"I think they just want to see if your brain's still in there.\"\n\nBuffy winced. She hated when he put it that way. But Xander was right. They didn't want her here. She knew they didn't want her here. Why else would they do this? Why else would they make her go through the routine that every other person with brain damage goes through?\n\nBuffy reached over and turned on the radio. She turned it up, blocking out Xander's annoying voice.\n\nThey didn't want her here. They didn't care about her. It was all just a game.\n\nXander sighed. He was glad Buffy was back. He was so glad she was back. But he still couldn't help feeling bad for her. He couldn't help but worry about what would happen to her when this was all over. He couldn't help but wonder if he would be able to stop himself from hurting her when this was all over.\n\nHe drove around aimlessly. \"Do you want to talk about it?\"\n\n\"About what?\" Buffy asked absently.\n\n\"About what's bothering you.\"\n\nBuffy sighed. \"Why does something have to be bothering me?\"\n\nXander smiled. \"You're Buffy. I know you better than you know yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Buffy thought about that for a moment. It was true, she supposed. She was Buffy, and Xander was right. She couldn't remember everything about her old life, but she remembered Xander. She remembered him more than anyone else. \"So what is it? I mean, you're not usually this…chummy with me.\"\n\n\"I was worried about you.\"\n\n\"No, I mean…\" Buffy shook her head. \"You know what I mean. It's about what I said at the hospital, isn't it? You think I should leave Sunnydale, right?\"\n\n\"What?\" Xander was taken aback. \"No! Of course not!\"\n\n\"Xander, I'm not even really here.\"\n\n\"So? That doesn't matter. You still live here. I still live here.\"\n\n\"And what happens when I don't anymore? When I leave and you're left behind?\"\n\nXander turned the car. \"This is what I've been trying to tell you. I'm not leaving.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. You said it yourself. I'm not even really here.\"\n\n\"Buffy, you are here.\" Xander pulled into the parking lot of the Magic Box. He shut the engine off and turned to her. \"You've always been here.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't.\" Buffy shook her head. \"I was lost. But I'm here now. And I don't think I'm going to stay here for very long.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Xander asked.\n\n\"Because…\" Buffy swallowed. \"Because I don't think I belong here.\"\n\nXander frowned. \"You're Buffy. Of course you belong here.\"\n\n\"I'm not Buffy.\" Buffy tried to get out of the car, but Xander grabbed her wrist. \"Let go of me, Xander.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to let you go. You're in no condition to go anywhere.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that? I'm not in a wheelchair, I'm not using a cane. I'm just a little slow.\"\n\n\"That's the thing, Buffy. You're not slow. You're not even there.\"\n\n\"Xander, what are you talking about?\"\n\nXander sighed. \"Buffy, when you were in the hospital, did you remember anything?\"\n\n\"Of course I did. The whole time.\"\n\n\"You didn't, Buffy. You couldn't. You had no memory.\"\n\n\"Then how could I have remembered anything?\"\n\n\"Because your mind is slowly coming back to you.\" Xander glanced at the front door of the Magic Box. \"It's starting to come back to you. And you're going to have to leave.\"\n\n\"So what if I do? What's wrong with that?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Except that I don't want you to go.\"\n\n\"And you"

"This popular loop hike is rated difficult.\n\nOn the east side of the Laguna Mountains lies the 10,000-acre Cleveland National Forest. Once the private property of the Santa Fe Railway Company, it is now a favorite escape for thousands of visitors each year. Bordered by the Pacific Ocean, the City of San Diego and the San Diego River, it is rich in history.\n\nMore than 6,000 acres are designated wilderness in the Laguna Mountain Wilderness area, the largest wilderness in San Diego County. This area offers solitude in a rare, almost pristine environment of mountains and canyons. The area has two campgrounds, with a total of 34 campsites, and also two wilderness cabins that can be rented. These are popular with hikers and overnight campers alike.\n\nHikers will find more than 20 miles of designated trails, as well as many more unofficial trails. The Pacific Crest Trail, a 2,650-mile-long trail that runs from Mexico to Canada, passes through this area. A popular segment of this trail is the San Diego County portion of the Pacific Crest Trail. The Chiquito Loop Trail is a portion of this trail.\n\nThe Pamo Valley is a unique area, bordered by the Laguna Mountains to the east and Interstate 8 to the west. The mountains are part of a volcanic field that created the mountains and surrounding desert and includes the Volcan Mountains Wilderness Area.\n\nThe Spanish Dons, who ruled this region from 1769 to 1821, named the mountain range La Sierra de la Laguna. The name refers to the Laguna Mountains and to the lake that once existed at the present-day site of Lake Henshaw.\n\nThe Laguna Mountains contain a great deal of desert-like vegetation, such as ocotillo, desert holly and creosote bush. Some sections are forested with all three types of vegetation. The forested areas are home to the ponderosa pine, the largest and most long-lived tree in the United States.\n\nThe unique landscape of the Laguna Mountains includes the many canyons, ridges and mountains, which vary from 4,000 to 6,000 feet in elevation.\n\nCleveland National Forest is one of four national forests in California. The other three are the Angeles, Eldorado and San Bernardino National Forests.<|endoftext|>RE: Is this a rebrand or a naming error?\n\nSome time ago, this naming error happened with the Kindle, it was an E-Reader with a 7\" screen but no frontlight.

Most of us, most of the time, do not have to think about working.\n\nWe get up, and go to work. There’s always enough time to eat, sleep, go to a ball game or watch a TV show.\n\nThere’s always enough time for that stuff.\n\nWe’ve got no problem with working. In fact, we like it. Most of us do.\n\nThat’s not the issue.\n\nThe issue is the fact that most of us like to earn our keep.\n\nWe like to think we are not being a burden to our society. We like to think we are not living in a free-lunch society.\n\nWe do have a real problem with people who can’t or won’t work.\n\nIn fact, the working public has a real problem with them.\n\nA growing number of those people have some sort of physical or mental disability that makes it impossible for them to work. They have no choice but to rely on the charity of others to survive.\n\nThis is not easy for those who work.\n\nThey have a goodly number of people who just won’t work at all, or will work just long enough to get the public to take care of them. It’s very difficult for those who work to keep their work ethic intact.\n\nIt’s also difficult for those who are disabled to keep their moral fiber intact.\n\nAnd that’s a good thing.\n\nThe hard workers in this society need to be reminded that they are providing a valuable service to society. They need to be reminded that without them society would crumble.\n\nWe also need to keep a place for those who cannot work. That can be difficult because many of those people have learned to rely on their fellow man for a handout.\n\nIt’s up to those who work to keep things in balance.\n\nThat’s not easy.\n\nThe people who work need to keep their perspective.\n\nAnd they need to keep their noses to the grindstone.\n\nThey need to put up with the people who do not want to work and remember that the whole society is better for their labors.<|endoftext|>No, this isn’t a holiday season complaint from your kids, “Santa isn’t real!” This is a history lesson about a different mythical creature.\n\nWe’ve all heard about vampires.

"In order to successfully use the drones and sensors, which are needed for a safe and efficient inspection of large and complex facilities, a web based analysis and evaluation platform is needed. The platform is called “SAFE-WEB” and is presented in the paper. SAFE-WEB allows an easy registration of sensors and drones. Furthermore, it gives the possibility to integrate and visualize the obtained data. Furthermore, several types of risk analysis are possible in SAFE-WEB. A unique feature is the capability to specify an area, where drones and/or sensors can fly, and to create a risk analysis only for the desired area. This makes it possible to perform an efficient analysis and evaluation of the obtained data. Finally, an example of the application of the risk analysis will be presented. The application is carried out using a 3D model of a Nuclear Facility.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nNuclear power stations represent very large facilities. In general, the normal plant operation comprises many smaller building units. The normal surveillance is, therefore, divided into different parts of the plant and has the advantage that it is not necessary to inspect the whole plant in one time.\n\nIn the paper the 3D model of a nuclear power plant is analyzed and assessed using the available drone and sensor data. The analysis of the model is necessary because the object is used to specify the area for the flight of the drones and to set the risk analysis region.\n\n1.1. Area for Drones\n\nThe advantage of drones for inspections is that they can fly directly in the area, which is of interest. This is not possible using normal manned aircraft. The limitation of drones is that they have to be within the control of the operator. They have to be able to see them in order to be able to control them. The control is needed to avoid collision with other drones or collisions with the buildings of the object. In this paper, two options for the control of the drones are presented. The first is an autonomous flight control and the second is the control via an operator.\n\nFigure 1.1. shows the “area for drones” for the 3D model of the nuclear facility. This area is created by the operator who specifies the region, where drones should be allowed to fly and where the analysis should be performed. For example, the operator can select the area shown in Figure 1.1. and then the drones and sensors are used to perform the analysis and evaluation only in this area.\n\nFigure 1.1. Area for the drones.\n\n1.2. Risk Analysis Region\n\nThe drones and sensors need a clearly specified area to carry out the analysis. The area is called “risk analysis region”. For example, if the operator selects the area shown in Figure 1.1. for the analysis, the drones and sensors fly in this area. Then, the data are gathered and analyzed by the operator. Then, the result is presented to the operator.\n\nIn this paper, two different options for the risk analysis are presented. The first one is an automatic risk analysis, where the user specifies a maximum amount of permissible risk. The second option is the capability to specify a risk analysis region with a boundary, where the area is cut off, where drones and sensors are not allowed to fly. In this paper, the automatic risk analysis is presented.\n\nThe capability to automatically generate the risk analysis region is a great advantage. The operator does not need to know the exact area of interest. He just specifies a general area. The automatic risk analysis can be performed in several levels. The highest level includes several basic items like structural failure, fire, blast and irradiation. This level of analysis is also called “super-level”.\n\nThe super-level is a very large amount of data. The number of variables is about 25 times the number of variables for the normal risk analysis. Because of this, the super-level is used only if there is a specific need for it.\n\nThe analysis is very useful and important to perform inspections, which will be controlled by drones and sensors. In this paper, the analysis is applied to the nuclear facility shown in Figure 1.2. This nuclear power plant consists of five units. Three of these units are different types of nuclear reactors. The main part of the nuclear power plant is the “containment building” which is not shown in Figure 1.2. The small boxes in Figure 1.2 are the different units, which are part of the nuclear facility.\n\nFigure 1.2. Nuclear power plant\n\nIn order to create the analysis, several sensors are used. Figure 1.3 shows the sensors, which are necessary for the analysis of the nuclear facility shown in Figure 1.2. There are four drones which are used to create the top view. Furthermore, there are two sensors which are needed to gather the data for the analysis. One sensor is a small helicopter and the second one is a car. The sensors are used to gather data like radiation, temperatures and stress on the walls of the building.\n\nFigure 1.3. Sensors for the analysis\n\n2. Preparation of the Model for the Analysis\n\nIn this section, the preparation of the model for the analysis is shown.\n\nThe main part of the preparation of the model is to create a map which shows the 3D area. Figure 1.4 shows the map of the model. The big rectangle shows the total area of the nuclear facility. Inside the rectangle, the specific area of interest is shown. The analysis will only be performed inside the area shown in Figure 1.4. The selected area is large enough to allow a safe flight of the drones. The selected area is used to generate the analysis region and it is also used to specify the area for the drones and sensors.\n\nFigure 1.4. Map of the model\n\nIn addition to the area for the drones and sensors, the following must be defined:\n\nThe locations of the drones\n\nThe locations of the sensors\n\nA description of the analysis, which is carried out on the drones and sensors\n\nFurthermore, the model needs to be prepared for the required analysis. To do this, the sensor data and the drone data are to be analyzed.\n\n2.1. Sensor Data\n\nThe sensor data are measured by the sensors in the area, where the analysis is to be performed. The data are gathered by the sensors and then sent to the operator. The operator can analyze the data and then specify the risk analysis area and the risk analysis itself.\n\nThe sensors are used for the following measurements:\n\nRadiation\n\nTemperature\n\nStress on the walls\n\nOne of the important measurements is radiation. The following data are required for the analysis of the radiation:\n\nPeak value\n\nAverage value\n\nArea\n\nFor each measurement, one or more locations are defined. The data are then gathered and a map, which shows the measurement result, is created. Figure 1.5 shows an example of the map. The map shows the radiation measured in one of the locations. In addition, the peak value, average value and the area of the radiation is shown in the map.\n\nFigure 1.5. Example of the map, which shows the measurement results\n\nThe data are shown in a map which has a high resolution. Figure 1.5. shows a map with a resolution of 1m x 1m.\n\n2.2. Drone Data\n\nThe drone data is the result of the data gathered by the drones in the area, where the analysis is to be performed. The data are gathered and the drone control software interprets the data. The results of the data are sent to the operator and they are used to determine the analysis region.\n\nThe data, which are used for the analysis of the drones are:\n\nRadiation\n\nTemperature\n\nStress on the walls\n\nOne of the important data is radiation. The following data are required for the analysis of the radiation:\n\nPeak value\n\nAverage value\n\nArea\n\nFor each measurement, one or more locations are defined. The data are then gathered and a map, which shows the measurement result, is created. Figure 1.6 shows an example of the map. The map shows the radiation measured in one of the locations. In addition, the peak value, average value and the area of the radiation is shown in the map.\n\nFigure 1.6. Example of the map, which shows the measurement results\n\nThe data are shown in a map which has a high resolution. Figure 1.6. shows a map with a resolution of 1m x 1m.\n\n2.3. Analysis of the Drone Data\n\nThe drone data is used to create the analysis region. This is done by specifying the area in which the drone can fly and by creating the risk analysis.\n\nTo do this, the operator creates a map, which shows the drone flight area. Figure 1.7. shows the drone flight area for the 3D model of the nuclear power plant. The flight area has a large size because the drones are controlled by an operator. This means that the drones have to be in the range of the operator’s sight. For this reason, the area has to be big.\n\nFigure 1.7. Drone flight area\n\nThe drone flight area is then used to create the risk analysis. Figure 1.8. shows the risk analysis for the drone flight area. The drone flight area is shown in blue. The analysis is created for the area where the operator can see the drones.\n\nFigure 1.8. Drone flight area and risk analysis\n\nThe operator has several options to create the risk analysis. In this paper, the operator can define a maximum level of permissible risk for the radiation. This means that the risk analysis is carried out automatically. In this way"
"Reflexology\n\nReflexology is a holistic modality that focuses on the feet. The hands of a reflexologist do not physically touch the feet of the client. Instead, a client is seated while the reflexologist is behind them and will apply deep pressure, pressure with the ball of the foot, or kneading to the feet and sometimes the legs.\n\nThe objective of reflexology is to restore the body to its natural state of well-being and balance by stimulating certain reflexes. This form of bodywork has its roots in ancient Egypt, India, China and Japan.\n\nReflexology is used in a variety of settings and is gaining in popularity as a complementary therapy for pain management and stress reduction. The action of pressing on reflex points on the feet can reduce tension and release muscle spasms.\n\nA trained reflexologist will be able to balance the energy throughout the entire body and encourage all areas of the body to work in harmony. Reflexology is a gentle and soothing therapy that can be used as an alternative to other more aggressive techniques or as a complementary therapy.<|endoftext|>The scheme is currently being piloted by West Sussex County Council but aims to be available for everyone in the UK who wants it. The council is aiming to have a potential service area that covers around a quarter of the UK population – approximately eight million people.\n\nUsers will be able to access the service through an app, for free or for a fee – although the council has not yet decided on the pricing model – that will help them identify and arrange home and visiting care.\n\nThe council has already run two tests of the app to look at the system’s usability, and although not all the features of the service have been released, it has been made available to “hundreds of people”.\n\nIn the first test, the council asked users to identify what they would find most useful from the app.\n\nThey were also asked to discuss their needs, which in turn helped the council to identify the features that were likely to be most important for users.\n\nThe second test saw the council work with users with more significant health conditions – although they were not part of a specific group – and this helped it to further refine the service and identify other potential features, the council said.\n\nIt is now focusing on two potential versions of the app, which is expected to be ready by September 2018.\n\nThe scheme is one of a number of digital offerings that are part of the council’s drive to transform the way it provides public services.\n\nAmong these is a new online service that lets residents book a new council tax or non-tax payers tax in a matter of minutes, as well as new apps that can help them report problems with streets, bins and trees.<|endoftext|>US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday said the administration of US President Donald Trump will pursue “a very different strategic relationship” with Russia.\n\n“I’d like to talk about a very different topic, and that is Russia. We’ve all been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the election. We stand by those assessments,” Tillerson told a Washington news conference.\n\n“And we certainly acknowledge the right of each nation to pursue their own foreign policy, and I know that some of the charges that have been levied against the current administration have come from the real policies of the United States.”\n\n“I’d like to offer assurances of the American people. This administration has its own approach,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think it is useful to be doing a tit-for-tat with this,” Tillerson said.\n\n“There has to be a degree of respect in how we approach each of these relationships,” he added. “If there is not respect, that doesn’t create an environment for the way we do things.”\n\n“We are not asking for recognition of a new cold war, or a new anything. We’re just asking for respect of each others’ interests and that we work together,” Tillerson said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had on Tuesday called for the restoration of a joint US-Russia ceasefire in Syria, a rare show of cooperation between the two world powers.\n\nTrump, during a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan, also warned that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) must be destroyed.\n\n“Syria is waiting for the United States, and we hope they will not disappoint us,” he said, indicating he wants Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage the United States to destroy ISIS.\n\n“As far as Syria is concerned, the world is going to have to come together, and we have to stop the killing and the death,” he added. “We have to stop the gas.”\n\n“I think that Russia will make a big difference,” Trump added.\n\n“This is not a question of us backing out,” he added. “I want to get as many to (ISIS) as possible. I want to get the Middle East in general to get rid of it.”\n\n“But I think Russia will have a great influence over Syria. And to that end, if it is going to be an attack on the United States, it will be an attack on the United States. You can’t change that,” Trump warned.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, also indicated he wants the United States and Russia to work together on destroying ISIS.\n\n“It’s an honor to have King Abdullah of Jordan and his representatives with us. We’ve had tremendous relations with Jordan,” he said.\n\n“One of the things that we will discuss is the fact that we would love to have the Russians in a partnership in working out Syria, and if that happens, that will be a great thing,” Trump added.<|endoftext|>In these reports, we have presented new data and evaluated and reinterpreted data from previous studies to identify a common pathway by which calcium dysregulation leads to increased risk of disease. Two data sources we present here are as follows.\n\nWe have shown the strong association between cardiovascular and other diseases and calcium dysregulation in the United States in both men and women by estimating the prevalence of hypertension and calcium dysregulation based on a large and well-defined population of middle-aged adults. Our finding that the prevalence of calcium dysregulation, i.e., a positive response to one or more questions, was 4.1% in men and 4.3% in women was comparable to a number of other previous studies. We reported for the first time that age, race, and disease all modified the association between hypertension and calcium dysregulation.\n\nAnother novel finding in this study was that calcium dysregulation was not associated with increased mortality in middle-aged men but was associated with increased mortality in middle-aged women. The former finding suggests that the adverse health effects of hypertension and calcium dysregulation are equivalent in men and women and therefore the differences in the prevalence of these factors by sex should be considered when evaluating the associations of hypertension and calcium dysregulation with disease. The latter finding, i.e., increased mortality in women with calcium dysregulation, has been shown in prior studies [3, 4, 15, 29, 30].\n\nThe observed associations of calcium dysregulation with hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease are the same in men and women, and the associations with stroke, coronary artery disease, and kidney disease are equivalent. This suggests that the mechanisms by which these associations occur in men and women are similar. This would be expected because the calcium levels in blood are, to a large extent, regulated in a similar way in both men and women, i.e., by calcium binding proteins [20]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the associations are different in men and women because they may be due to different distributions of risk factors in men and women or because they may reflect different amounts of disease in the two sexes. For example, the correlation between calcium dysregulation and hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease may be different in men and women because the disease prevalence is different. Also, the amount of calcium dysregulation may be different in men and women, for example, because of differences in serum calcium levels. It would be important to further study the relationship between calcium dysregulation and various diseases in men and women to confirm our finding.\n\nThe association between calcium dysregulation and mortality was stronger in men with hypertension than in men without hypertension, although the associations were similar in men with and without hypertension in women. The reason for this is unknown. However, these findings are consistent with previous findings that the association between hypertension and mortality is stronger in men than in women [31, 32, 33]. We also found that calcium dysregulation was associated with increased mortality in middle-aged women but not in middle-aged men. This is consistent with the findings of a previous report that the association between calcium dysregulation and mortality is stronger in middle-aged women than in middle-aged men [34]. This could be due to the fact that a stronger association between calcium dysregulation and mortality in middle-aged women is due to a stronger association between calcium dysregulation and hypertension in middle-aged women than in men. Also, the stronger association between calcium dysregulation and mortality in middle-aged women than in middle-aged men could be due to a stronger association between calcium dysregulation and mortality in women who are at an advanced age, especially when hypertension has already developed.\n\nBecause calcium dysregulation was associated with increased mortality in women, we evaluated the possibility that the association between calcium dysregulation and mortality was due to undiagnosed hypertension or hyperglycemia. In fact, we did"

For my experience with Paleovalley, go check out this post!\n\nLike many Paleo eaters, I really missed having cookies on the go – paleo or not.\n\nWhen I heard that Paleovalley made Paleo Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, I was instantly excited. But I wanted to know if it was really worth the hype and the price.\n\nThe reason I like paleo-friendly treats so much is because I can have them on the go or right out of the fridge.\n\nAnd because I’m a busy mom who needs snacks.\n\nWhen I opened the jar and tried the Paleovalley’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough for the first time, I was sooo surprised.\n\nUsually, anything coconut-based has a weird taste to me, so I was prepared for this.\n\nBut the cookie dough was really tasty.\n\nI was even more surprised when I found out that there were no refined sugar, preservatives, and not even refined flour.\n\nIt’s made with a blend of real vanilla, butter, and coconut oil and sweetened with dates.\n\nI’m definitely ordering a box or two of the Paleo Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough soon.\n\nAnd it’s available in four flavors – Paleo Chocolate Chip, Cinnamon Raisin, Apple Cinnamon, and Coconut.\n\nI have yet to try the other three.\n\nAt about $6/jar, it’s a little bit more expensive than buying it at Whole Foods or other retailers. But when I’m in a pinch and need something to go, the price is well worth it!\n\nDid you try the Paleovalley’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough yet?\n\nDo you think you’ll try it?\n\nAlso Read: Paleo Sandwich Breads<|endoftext|>BARRETT CITY MAN SENTENCED TO 42 YEARS FOR SEXUALLY ASSAULTING BOY\n\nA Barre City man was sentenced to 42 years in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old boy in the fall of 2012.\n\nWilliam Fogg, 59, of 79 Florence Road, pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child on Thursday, Feb. 27, in Washington County criminal court. He was sentenced to 42 years, suspended after 32 years, and 10 years of probation. He was ordered to pay $1,000 in court costs.\n\nAccording to an affidavit by Vermont State Police Detective Daniel Walker, the assault occurred in Barre City in October 2012. The child told police the assault had happened in Fogg’s residence.\n\nFogg told police in an interview that the boy had been staying with him, but denied any sexual contact had taken place. Police conducted a search of Fogg’s residence and found no evidence of child pornography.\n\nJudge Thomas Zonay said he had seen the “black and white” of the crime and knew the difficult road the victim was going to have to travel.\n\n“You have caused great harm to a 10-year-old child,” Zonay said. “If there was ever a predator, it is you.”\n\nFogg was sentenced under the state’s Three Strikes Law.\n\nAt Fogg’s request, his attorney Robert Katims made a request for a reduced sentence on Fogg’s behalf, saying that Fogg had entered into a “long term” treatment program for sex offenders.\n\n“He’s not a threat to anyone now or in the future,” Katims said.\n\nAccording to police, Fogg is a Level 3 sex offender. The defendant told the court he had been working for the same employer for 20 years, and that he and his employer had offered to have the boy come and work with Fogg.\n\nFogg also told the court that he and the victim had made contact again after the assault, and had reconciled. He said that he had stayed in contact with the victim because he thought the boy’s father would have been hurt by their friendship ending.\n\nAccording to court papers, Fogg had served prison time in Vermont for sexual assault of a child and sexual assault on a person incapable of consent.\n\nThe victim told police he wanted to speak at the sentencing hearing, but was too nervous to do so.\n\nThe boy’s mother said she felt terrible about how the family was going to deal with this situation.\n\nShe asked the court for a reduced sentence for Fogg.\n\n“I’m asking for a second chance,” she said.\n\nWashington County State’s Attorney Scott Williams said he agreed that Fogg had been in treatment, but that this crime happened over a period of time, and he was worried that Fogg had a “sexual relationship” with the victim.\n\nWashington County Judge Thomas Zonay imposed the sentence.\n\n“This is a horrible offense,” Zonay said. “I hope you are a better person when you are released.”<|endoftext|>Budget\n\nThe more money you have, the more choices you can make. If you’re wondering how to best budget your finances, you need to ask yourself how you’ll spend your money. Will it be on a better car, a bigger house, a newer smartphone? Or, will you be saving for the future? There are a lot of factors to consider when deciding how to budget, but in the end, it will be up to you.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nJust like the present, it is hard to predict the future. But as the saying goes, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. This is why it is so important to save for the future. This is what having a budget is all about. It is a way to make sure that you’ll have enough money to last throughout your entire life.\n\nFor example, say you’re saving up for a car that costs $30,000. If you’re saving up at a rate of $50 a month, it will take you 60 months to save up for that car. If you’re saving up for $500 a month, it will take you 20 months. The earlier you start, the better.

"LAS VEGAS — Conor McGregor’s coach says the mixed martial arts star is in “fantastic” shape and wants to fight Khabib Nurmagomedov on Oct. 6 for a UFC lightweight championship.\n\nJohn Kavanagh said on Twitter that McGregor is “doing very well after his surgery” to fix a ruptured ligament in his left knee.\n\nMcGregor, who is Irish, posted a message on Twitter on Tuesday saying he’s “ready” to fight in October.\n\nUFC president Dana White has said that McGregor, who hasn’t fought in the octagon since 2016, has two fights left on his contract with the UFC.\n\nMcGregor was stripped of his UFC lightweight championship when he opted not to defend his belt against Nurmagomedov, who was offered the opportunity as the next highest-ranked contender.\n\nNurmagomedov is the UFC’s lightweight champion and has been waiting to fight McGregor since last year, when he said the Irishman could make some money outside the octagon before returning.\n\nMcGregor was allowed to fight boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a 10th-round technical knockout in August 2017, as part of a deal that had him agree to give up his lightweight belt and allow Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson to fight for the belt.\n\nFerguson was sidelined after suffering a knee injury in a freak accident in August. He is now set to fight Anthony Pettis at UFC 229 on Oct. 6.\n\nKavanagh said on Twitter that Ferguson will be next in line to fight Nurmagomedov, but there is no certainty when the bout will happen.\n\nWhite has said that Ferguson-Pettis will be the UFC’s main event at UFC 229.\n\nNurmagomedov, meanwhile, has offered McGregor a fight at UFC 230 on Nov. 3, at New York’s Madison Square Garden. But White has said McGregor has other options that he prefers.\n\nNurmagomedov has demanded McGregor receive no special treatment in their fight.\n\n“If he wants to come back, if he wants to fight, we’re here,” Nurmagomedov told the website MMA Junkie. “But if he’s looking for a different fight, different opponents, different contracts, I don’t know.”<|endoftext|>and many with HIV\n\nDaily Mail UK\n\nEvery night, Ken McCauley lies awake in a hospital bed, plagued by terrible headaches.\n\nHe is the man who has lived with HIV longer than any other person in the world.\n\nThe 58-year-old’s story began on a summer’s day in the early 1980s when he contracted the virus while having sex with an intravenous drug user.\n\nHe had no idea he was infected.

Jest to niezbyt duże i wygodne pomieszczenie. Restauracja jest czysta i klimatyzowana. Podczas wizyty było jednak tylko jedno stoliki dla gości i innych pokoi. Na to stolik do każdego wstawiono tabliczkę. Żeby nie było nudno i nie musieliśmy siedzieć nad sobą zamawiałem dania na terenie samego hotelu. Osoby, które weszły do pokoju po wszystkim zamówiły po prostu coś do śniadania. Śniadania były bogate i dość duże. W okolicy było wiele sklepów, do których chodziliśmy na zakupy. Ogród hotelowy był zielony i przyjemny. W ogrodzie i otoczeniu hotelu były własne sklepiki z pamiątkami, lody itp. W hotelu mieliśmy swój pokój z wanną i w pełni wyposażoną kuchnią. Prysznic był jak w każdym pokoju hotelowym, natomiast umywalki były na razie małe i przycięte. Obok są dwie jacuzzi. Dla dzieci był osobny basen. W basenie było dostępne jedzenie i napoje. Obejrzeliśmy kilka razy plażę, która była dosyć spora, ale trochę brakowało miejsca do siedzenia. Bardzo nam się spodobało. Obsługa hotelu była przyjemna i życzliwa.

"1. It's \"firmware\" not \"firm ware.\" Try to get a better handle on your grammar before you get your grammar wrong.\n\n2. Calling something a \"feature\" doesn't make it a feature. It's a mislabeling. The way these displays are lit up is a hardware implementation of a \"gradient.\" The gradient of color is the \"feature\" of the gradient, not the entire display.\n\n3. The function of a gradient in this case is not to \"determine\" color or value, it is to make the display more aesthetically pleasing. There is a huge difference.\n\n4. The system was designed by people who knew how to do lighting in a way that adds visual interest. There is a reason that their work was considered \"taste-based.\" It was designed by people who knew how to do lighting. Lighting is all about creating mood and impact, not function.\n\n5. The system was designed so that it would be physically impossible to light all the light sources the same, that way there would be no color \"accurate\" (read \"unpleasing\") way to light the display. As long as people can see it clearly, it will never be \"accurate.\"\n\n6. In this application, color accuracy is the least of the concerns, and it is not the main consideration. It is a display, not a video image.\n\n7. If the numbers of the OLEDs are off, they will still light up. They will not \"burn in.\" A long exposure to a dark scene will turn the display black, and that's all there is to it.\n\n8. Those are just panels with color filters over them. They are not LEDs. The whites are not being filtered, they are being lit up as one.\n\n9. Because they are lit up individually and not together as a whole, the panels do not \"add up\" to make the perceived color and intensity of light. It's a bit like red, green and blue, and how they do not really \"add up\" to make a full white light. (And the full white you see is more likely white than red, green or blue).\n\n10. Just because you can prove that something is \"not black\" doesn't make it \"not black.\" There are more than a few tungsten lamps out there that aren't really \"black,\" but people would be pretty annoyed if you said they weren't really \"black.\"\n\n11. White LEDs are also not the most \"color accurate\" light source out there. They have to be filtered to get that way. If you don't filter them, you don't get the same white as if you did filter them.\n\n12. People actually are aware of color. It is not as if they cannot distinguish color differences. They may not see every single pixel of difference, but they are still going to see differences. They can distinguish a difference between an \"R\" and an \"L\" in some fonts. If you put those two letters side by side, the difference will be visible. It is not going to look identical to them.\n\n13. \"Accurate color\" is a subjective term. What may be accurate to you may not be accurate to me.\n\n14. Just because a company makes an extra $10 by selling you a part that does something that it was not designed for doesn't make it right. It just means you are getting ripped off.\n\n15. Yes, the color of the display is very important to the perception of the light in the environment, but it is not the only factor.\n\n16. Not all blue LEDs are the same. In fact, the blue from blue LEDs changes with age. You have to take this into account in your designs.\n\n17. No, it is not impossible to change the light of a display.\n\n18. Yes, you can still get better uniformity if you combine the LEDs into one panel. You will also get better efficiency, but the screen won't look as good.\n\n19. The individual LEDs can only emit a certain amount of light. They cannot magically produce more.\n\n20. You can get even better efficiency if you replace the red and green LEDs with white LEDs. It is a tradeoff, though. It is not a free lunch.\n\n21. LEDs emit light in a different range of color than the human eye can detect. They have a certain distribution of color, not a specific one.\n\n22. Because the color distribution of the LEDs is not the same as the human eye, you have to modify the LEDs to make them appear to the human eye as if they were emitting the correct color light.\n\n23. The human eye is not linear, which is what is being assumed. This is what allows you to see the color of white. It is also what allows you to perceive the color of a cloudy sky.\n\n24. If you want to look at \"color accuracy,\" take a look at the color of the light in the environment that the display is in. It will be different in each of them. The difference between the human eye and a camera is also a huge consideration, as cameras are not very good at capturing all of the available color in an image.\n\n25. Blue LEDs do not go through a filter to be blue. They are actually more \"white\" than blue, so you have to color-filter them. This is not necessarily an \"extra\" step, as it does not have to be done to \"make them blue.\"\n\n26. You can make a good case for certain LEDs being \"super blue,\" but you cannot make a case that they are \"super red.\" Red is the hardest color for LEDs to produce. You can make the case that you can produce more \"pure\" red than can be seen by the human eye, but you cannot make the case that you can produce more \"pure\" red than can be produced by a red LED.\n\n27. If the LEDs can do something \"super\" (in this case, \"super red\"), then the LEDs can do something \"normal\" (in this case, \"normal red.\") There is no free lunch, there are just tradeoffs.\n\n28. Trying to compare \"new\" with \"old\" (to sell you something) is an old, well-established, tired sales technique.\n\n29. You can say a person has 20/20 vision, but you cannot say a display has \"perfect color.\"\n\n30. Yes, OLEDs can do things that no other display technology can do. They can also do things that some other display technologies can do. That does not mean that you can't make a display that has features that OLEDs don't have.\n\n31. You can make a display that has good color rendition, that is not an OLED. It just means you are not using OLEDs.\n\n32. Just because a manufacturer says \"this is what you are going to get\" doesn't mean you are going to get it. If you need something that is color accurate, you need to specify it. If you do not, then you get what they give you.\n\n33. If you look at a display and you say \"it looks too blue,\" then you are probably right. But that doesn't mean it is inaccurate. That just means you are looking at it the way you would look at it in real life.\n\n34. There are many factors that influence color perception in a viewing environment. There is no single factor that influences color perception in a viewing environment.\n\n35. Color accuracy is just one aspect of the human visual system, and just because it is not the only aspect does not make it not the only aspect.\n\n36. If you are a designer, you have to understand the limits of the technology and the product that you are working with. If you do not, then you are not going to be very successful.\n\n37. People like to think that designers can control everything, but they can't. It's just a fact of life.\n\n38. The human visual system is much more complicated than a display or a camera.\n\n39. Just because a technology has a lot of colors, it doesn't mean you have to use all of them.\n\n40. Just because a display can produce a certain color, it doesn't mean you have to use it.\n\n41.

"Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders has promised to end our current immigration policies and implement a new policy, which will favor immigrants from countries that have a history of struggling with socialism.\n\nDuring his CNN town hall, Sanders was asked by an illegal immigrant named Marcela if he planned to help her and her fellow undocumented brethren.\n\n“Absolutely, we will,” Sanders replied.\n\n“The idea that you have so many wonderful people who want to contribute to the fabric of our society,” he said, “is something I very, very strongly believe in.”\n\n“That means,” he continued, “we need comprehensive immigration reform.”\n\nSanders’ new immigration reform will make it much easier for those who have socialist tendencies to move to America.\n\n“What it does is bring 11 million undocumented people out of the shadows. It would provide them with legal protection and allow them to work with full rights in this country. And it would provide a path toward citizenship,” he explained.\n\n“I voted against this draconian legislation in 2006. I voted against it again in 2013. And I will do everything in my power to overturn it.”\n\n“We need a path toward citizenship for people who are undocumented,” he concluded.\n\nIronically, Sanders was able to support this legislation because his socialistic tendencies weren’t under the scrutiny of a large voting base. Had he been elected in this era, his political allies would have been able to reveal the fact that he is a hypocrite, as he supported immigration legislation which could potentially cost Americans their jobs.\n\nThere’s no denying that immigrants have helped to build our country and that immigration is vital to our national security and our economic health. But there’s a time and a place for everything, and a time to admit when you were wrong, especially when that error may have hurt Americans.\n\nSource: Daily Caller<|endoftext|>James Henry Carleton, also known as Jimmy Carleton (April 26, 1852 – February 18, 1924) was a lieutenant general in the United States Army during the Spanish–American War, and later a military adviser to the Philippines. He was later elected as a U.S. Senator from California.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nCarleton was born in Claremont, New Hampshire, son of Francis Carleton (1821–1902) and Lydia (Patterson) Carleton (1819–1901). He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1873. After graduation, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st Cavalry Regiment.\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nIn the Apache Wars, Carleton commanded Apache scouts in the Army of the Southwest from 1880 to 1882. As an officer with the rank of captain in 1885, Carleton served with the 9th Cavalry in Texas. During the Spanish–American War, he commanded a volunteer troop of the Rough Riders at the Battle of San Juan Hill. He then led troops in Cuba, and from 1899 to 1900 served as a military observer in South Africa. In 1900, Carleton was sent to the Philippines, where he served in a number of different positions, and became a close confidant of future Philippine president Manuel Quezon.[1]\n\nIn 1902, Carleton was appointed Adjutant General of the Philippines, and from 1903 to 1906 he served as governor of Mindanao. In 1907, he returned to the United States and worked as the adjutant general of the Army until his retirement in 1911. In retirement, Carleton was active in civic and business affairs in San Francisco. He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1914 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James D. Phelan and served from December 2, 1914, to March 3, 1917.\n\nDeath [ edit ]\n\nCarleton died in Berkeley, California, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nOn June 4, 1881, Carleton married Mary King White, the daughter of General Rufus King of New York. They had two children, Lydia and Rufus.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]<|endoftext|>Vanguard University’s 3-year old science and technology building, Hunt Hall, has become the first on campus building to achieve LEED platinum status, a recognition from the U.S. Green Building Council that is the highest level of sustainable building certification. The new building, which opened in August 2009, was constructed to provide specialized laboratory and classroom space for chemistry, biology, earth science, mathematics, physics, and digital art, graphics, and photography programs.\n\n“We’re very excited and honored to receive this prestigious recognition,” said Dr. C. Stanley (Bucky) Jones, president of Vanguard University. “In addition to the environmental benefits of this new facility, it is also extremely functional. It has set a high standard for us to follow in future construction and renovation projects.”\n\nLEED Platinum is the highest of four levels of LEED certification. Buildings must achieve a score of at least 80 out of 100 possible points to receive the award. Hunt Hall’s score is 93.\n\nTo achieve platinum status, Hunt Hall used recycled and low VOC materials, is more energy efficient, has better indoor air quality, and has extensive indoor and outdoor water conservation measures.\n\nHunt Hall is designed with innovative features to conserve water, including low-flow toilets, a ground-water recovery system for toilets and urinals, and low-flow showerheads. The building also has low-flow hand dryers and high-efficiency faucets. Outdoor water-wise features include drought-tolerant landscaping and a rooftop rainwater catchment system.\n\nOther water conservation features include a dark-colored roof, skylights, and window blinds that use computer-controlled solar shades that open and close automatically, saving additional energy when daylight is sufficient.\n\nTo help conserve energy, Hunt Hall uses photo-voltaic panels for electricity, and high-performance exterior windows and insulated walls that reduce the need for heating and cooling. The building has heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems that provide highly efficient temperature control.\n\nA green roof on top of the building protects the building from sun and rainfall, and reduces the amount of storm water that needs to be treated.\n\nA LEED point is awarded for each of seven categories: sustainable site, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation and design, and regional priority.\n\nHunt Hall has won several other awards since its completion. It was the recipient of the Grand Award for Best Green Building by the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA), in the high school and higher education categories. The building was also named a 2009 Western College or University Project of the Year by the Western Chapter of the Building and Construction Trades Council, and received a Construction Excellence Award from the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).<|endoftext|>The Zune HD does not come with a headset and you will need a wired headset to use the headset jack on the device.

There was my anonymity. There was my credibility as a novelist. The old troublemaker, suddenly confused and afraid.\n\nI spent last summer under the clouds of suspicion and doubt. I had already lost more than $20,000 in legal fees when my book editor flew in from New York. We were going to talk about whether I should fight the false accusation that I had stolen the title of my second novel, “Bright Lights, Big City,” from an unpublished manuscript.\n\nWe had spent the previous two hours in the windowless office of my lawyer, defending the accuracy of the description of the 1982 dance club that I had spent a year writing about, the scene where I had first used the title in print.\n\nIt was the day before my wedding, in the year before my 50th birthday, and my book editor was telling me how sorry she was that I was getting married. She was telling me she was sure my wife-to-be would get divorced. She was telling me that it was “impossible” for a woman to love me and that I shouldn’t even try to stay married to her.\n\nA moment later, she stood up, took my hand and said, “I’m going to fight"
"A fellow from AllTrials.net pointed out to me a study by the Journal of Clinical Oncology entitled “Association of Trial Registration With Journal Impact Factor and the Probability of Trials Being Published in Relation to Registered Results.” The basic study design was as follows:\n\nEvaluate the relationship between registered results and publication of trial results on the Journal of Clinical Oncology Web site.\n\nThe researchers identified a total of 116 trials from the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and the Journal of Clinical Oncology Web site, which were published during 2003 to 2011. The authors determined whether a trial was registered or not. From the conclusions:\n\nAs of January 2013, 56% (68 of 116) of trials had results available in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Web site. For registered trials, there was a positive association between registered status and the likelihood of publication of trial results in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Although there was no statistically significant association between trial outcome and registration status, there was a trend toward more positive results being published for registered trials.\n\nThis study suggests that, while registered results don’t guarantee publication, they have a positive impact. Yet it’s important to remember that the proportion of trials registered that are actually published was about half (54%), which is far from 100%. I would also like to see this study replicated in other clinical trial registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov and the European Clinical Trial Register), since the JCO is a highly selective journal. I would also like to see a study with a longer time-frame. I don’t know how long the paper was in the works, but I’m guessing it took a while.\n\nWhile the study seems reasonable, I’m not sure how much one can extrapolate from this paper in terms of impact on clinical trial registration and publication of results. It’s just one piece of the puzzle, as AllTrials points out.\n\nImage by dave_7 via Flickr\n\nLike this: Like Loading...<|endoftext|>Spherical Dice, labeled as 12-Sided Dice, are an uncommon variety of die that appears in Mario Party 4, Mario Party 5, Mario Party 6, Mario Party 7, Mario Party 8, Mario Party 9, and Mario Party: Island Tour. They function the same as regular Dice Blocks in that they roll and land on a number value, and allow players to move a number of spaces on the board based on that value.

We also hold a parade and a ceremony in the Ardenwood district of the Community Center where those who have served our country, be it in military service or other forms of government service, can be recognized for their contributions. I believe that the overwhelming majority of our residents would appreciate having an observance of this important day.\n\nI learned that we had some veterans who were residents at the time, but they were few in number and the parade was not held that year. Perhaps the occasion had not been sufficiently advertised and a sufficient number of residents were not aware of the event.\n\nI don’t know how many of our veterans have passed away in the past 10 years, but I would like to see some way in which we could honor them on this occasion. I know that residents of the Ardenwood area would be delighted to have this occur again. I encourage the current members of the Community Management Board to look into this matter. I have already contacted some of our residents who were interested in this subject when I was Board president.\n\nI have been thinking about Frank, a Navy veteran and a WWII survivor of the USS Lexington, who was a good friend and an outstanding member of the Board. He had such a sense of loyalty and patriotism and really loved the U.S. flag.\n\nIt is never too late to give thanks and to show our appreciation.\n\nSylvia K.

"Submission of the Month - April 2011\n\nStephanos\n\n18 years old, from the United States\n\nStephanos submitted this high school senior photo session and we're quite pleased with the results. Not only is the lighting well balanced, the background is well set, but more importantly, Stephanos' hair is on point. His hair in this shot is in a bit of a messy \"bed-head\" style, but it's what we're all looking for in our perfect senior portraits.\n\nStephanos, thanks for submitting this photo!\n\nVIEW MORE SUBMISSIONS<|endoftext|>View Full Version : Dualshock 3 remote\n\ngravestal\n\nThe Sony PS3 console uses a standard bluetooth dongle to enable communication with a Dualshock 3 remote.\n\nThe Windows Bluetooth stack is generally a bit crap, so here are some instructions on getting the dongle working with OS X and the new Xbox 360 Bluetooth dongle:\n\n\n\nFirst of all you need a bluetooth dongle for Windows. I used a cheap one from a shop called Wom, and although I had problems getting it to work I eventually managed it, so these instructions are based on using that dongle, and you may not be able to follow them with any other.\n\n\n\nOn my Windows PC, I used the generic Windows Bluetooth drivers, but other drivers may work.\n\n\n\nSo:\n\nPlug in the dongle.\n\nOpen up the device manager (Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager).\n\nFind the dongle, and right click on it.\n\nClick on Properties.\n\nClick on the Details tab.\n\nClick on the Property button (on the right hand side).\n\nScroll down to the MS info section and find the Default Format and Default Device Class. Make sure the settings are as below:\n\n\n\nDefault Format: Unicode UTF-16LE\n\nDefault Device Class: 0x07\n\nAfter all of that has been done, turn off your PC, unplug the dongle, and plug it into your Mac.\n\nOn the Mac, turn the Bluetooth dongle on (via a small switch on the dongle), and then open up the System Preferences.\n\nClick on the Bluetooth icon.\n\nYou should now see the dongle appear as a connected device. Select it and you're away!\n\nFor the PS3, you need to open up the System Preferences (via the Apple menu).\n\nClick on the Bluetooth icon.\n\nSelect the PS3 from the Devices list and click on the button that says \"Advanced\".\n\nThe following settings need to be configured:\n\n\n\nCharacter Set: Unicode UTF-16LE\n\nCodepage: 437\n\nYou should be all set to go!<|endoftext|>Located in the heart of the city in District One, Renaissance Saigon Hotel is the ideal base from which to explore Ho Chi Minh City.

In one of his most iconic roles, Top Gun, Cruise actually flew jets in real-life. For his new movie Jack Reacher, however, he had to leave his stunt man behind.\n\nWith director Christopher McQuarrie at the helm, Jack Reacher looks to be a hard-hitting action thriller that promises to give Cruise's daredevil side some free reign. One of the most dangerous scenes in the film? The moment Cruise's character runs into a car traveling at 50 mph.\n\nWith the help of stuntman Tim Rigby, Cruise made the risky move a reality. The actor explains that the car wasn't able to stop due to the speed at which it was traveling, so he had to make his run-in count. In order to do this, he had to use a technique that he learned in a training session with Rigby.\n\n“I had to have a good run at it and come in low,” Cruise explained, “so that I was going to make it. I’d only have a second to hit my mark.”\n\nNot only did the star have to remember his own part in the stunt, but he also had to make sure to block Rigby from the camera. To see just how tough it was to make the scene work, check out the video above.\n\nJack Reacher hits theaters Dec. 21.\n\nTell us what you think of Cruise's stunt work in the comments section below or tweet us @THR.\n\nTwitter: @AmandaLeeCook\n\nEmail: [email protected]<|endoftext|>Selling my Peavey Valveking 112 this amp has served me well and i love it, however I am trying to move in a new direction.

"Once you’ve got your SCOM environment setup, what do you do with it?\n\nThe next step is learning how to manage your environments using your new management system. There are a lot of options to learn, but you can get started with the basics fairly quickly and then move to advanced topics later. This blog is intended to introduce you to some of the basic tasks you can perform in SCOM once you have it up and running.\n\nFirst, you should know that there are three main nodes in the Operations Manager tree. The top node is the Management Group, the middle is the management server, and the bottom is the agent. We will focus on the top node and the bottom node.\n\nIn order to get started, the first thing you want to do is add one or more agent to your management group. I’ll focus on adding agents to the management group. When you get to a point where you are adding lots of agents, you can set up a group for those agents and add them as a group.\n\nTo add an agent, first select the root node, and then right click the Management Servers node. Select “Add Management Server”.\n\nThis will open the “Add Management Server” dialog. Select the agent you want to add.\n\nNow select the agent you want to add. This dialog allows you to define the monitoring root and specifies the details for the agent.\n\nThe next step is to add the management group to the console. Once you’ve added one or more management servers to the console, the next step is to add the management group. This is similar to adding the management servers, except you will be selecting the management group.\n\nThis will open the “Add Management Group” dialog. Select the group you want to add.\n\nOnce you’ve added the management group, you should be able to see the management servers and agent(s) within the management group. Now you’ve got the basics setup.\n\nNext, you’ll want to start monitoring something. Before you do anything, you should probably check out the default monitoring packs in Operations Manager. For SCOM 2007 there are two packs that are part of the default installation. They are Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) and Microsoft Monitoring Agent (32bit). These packs are installed under the default management group.\n\nMonitoring a node, service or application with these packs is very easy. Select the node you want to monitor, and then select the Pack.\n\nIn this example, I selected a server and then the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) pack. This will bring up the Select and Monitor Wizard.\n\nOn the “Select the monitored resource” screen, select the computer you want to monitor. The wizard is pretty self explanatory. Click “Next”.\n\nThe wizard will display a list of available services, applications, processes, and other entities that can be monitored.\n\nSelect the items you want to monitor. In this case, I will monitor the process “explorer.exe” and the Service “BITS”. Click “Next”.\n\nThe last step is to review the information on the “Select Resources to Monitor” screen and then click “Next”.\n\nThe wizard will display the information about the monitors you’ve selected. Click “Next”.\n\nYou will now be taken to the “Select Management Packs to monitor” screen. Select the packs you want to use. In this case, I am going to select Microsoft Monitoring Agent (64bit) and Microsoft System Center Service Manager.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the appropriate management packs, click “Next”.\n\nThe next step is to select the default displays. There are a number of displays you can use to view the information that is gathered from the agent. You can view the data for the computer, the agents, and you can also view the inventory. The inventory allows you to view the computer hardware and software information.\n\nSelect the displays you want to use, and then click “Next”.\n\nThe wizard will display the information about the displays you’ve selected. Click “Next”.\n\nThe wizard will then list the monitors and displays that are associated with the management pack. Click “Next”.\n\nThe last step is to review the information on the “Select Monitors and Display” screen. Make sure the information is correct. If you’ve chosen to monitor the system state, you’ll also be asked to select the critical state you want to monitor. Once you’ve verified the information, click “Finish”.\n\nThe “Monitoring Wizard” will start and monitor the information you’ve selected. Click “Next”.\n\nIf you’ve selected the “Agent inventory” you’ll be able to view the hardware and software information. This information is useful when you are performing assessments on your systems. You can use this information to validate your environment.\n\nYou can also view the monitors for the agent. Click “View Monitor”.\n\nYou can drill down into the monitors and view the details about the monitored information. Click “View Data”.\n\nYou can also view the monitored items graphically.\n\nThese packs allow you to quickly and easily get a view of the status of the monitored entities. In the next part of this series, I will talk about creating your own monitoring packs and will include examples.<|endoftext|>the intractable issue of euthanasia\n\nRecent Examples on the Web\n\nThis is a good moment to highlight the intractable problem of lagging political reform in Myanmar.

And after seeing how the event in Chicago went, we decided to go ahead with this week’s events as planned.\n\nThe second event at NYU went very well. The student population at NYU is very different than the population at the University of Chicago. It is a lot smaller and it is not a natural fit for our events.\n\nWe want to serve the students and do so in a way that works for them and so after talking to the students in New York, we decided to move Food for Thought off of our weekly rotation for the fall. It is just not a good fit for them right now.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe’re trying to make sure we’re moving Food for Thought forward and not backward. The goal here is not to try and find a place for Food for Thought that it will fit in, the goal is to find a place for Food for Thought that it will fit in.\n\nIf we have another event at the University of Chicago that’s a success, we’ll move forward and try to get one at another school.\n\nWe’ll also be using the extra time we have this week to work on logistics and see if there is anything we need to change in the way we organize our events in the future.\n\nWhat’s next for your organization?\n\nWe’re still going to be fundraising and we’re still going to be putting on events, but we’re going to be using the extra time this week to come up with new ideas for future events.\n\nHow can students get involved with Food for Thought?\n\nStudents can volunteer at our events. We also have a contact on our website for students who are interested in volunteering. And we’re looking for ideas and we’re always interested in hearing from students.\n\nIs the Food for Thought logo going to change?\n\nIt’s not going to change anytime soon, but we are looking into other things we can do to get more publicity for the Food for Thought project.\n\nWe’re looking into new ways to do fundraising. We’re looking at getting the word out there more, and it’s all because of what the students have done at these events this week.\n\nIf students had one question to ask you, what would it be?\n\n“Why do you do what you do?” I think it’s because when I was in college, it was really hard to make friends, it was really hard to figure out where I fit in, and it was really hard to figure out where I was going to work. And so now I’m trying to help students be successful.\n\nAnd even though I wasn’t successful when I was in college, I’m just trying to pay it forward.\n\nhttp://www.uchicago.edu/student-life/info/food-thought/<|endoftext|>Zasugerujte cestovateľom, že je možné vstupovať do Francúzska nehnutelným tovarom\n\nNehnutelný tovar (tovar, ktorý je osobitným odpadom v zmysle Parížskeho protokolu) je tovar, ktorý sa nepodlieha poplatkom v rámci prijatia za dovoz tovaru do Francúzska, alebo ktorý vyzerá ako osobitný odpad, alebo ktorý nie je príslušný ku dovoze (napr. vzorky zboží, marketingové predmety, dovolenkové záležitosti).

"The moments after disaster strikes are harrowing and leave thousands stranded in a shelter with basic needs unattended.\n\nAfter the earthquake in Haiti, the quake-ravaged country still had a few hours of daylight left and temperatures in the mid-80s, a perfect combination for a cholera outbreak. Because of the delay in providing clean drinking water to the masses, a cholera outbreak ensued, killing over 6,000 people. According to an article in the Lancet, another 90,000 people have been infected.\n\nAfter Haiti, there was a rash of media coverage on this vicious pathogen and the need for preparedness. Yet now, with the recent massive earthquake in Japan, reports are indicating that the number of cholera cases has been minimal. With a recent article in The New York Times, Dr. Atul Gawande, the author of The Checklist Manifesto, offers some lessons from Haiti.\n\nLesson #1: Time is the critical factor in controlling an outbreak.\n\nFor every hour in Haiti that people didn’t have access to clean water, the number of people with cholera doubled. In Japan, the delays in getting help to the masses have been measured in hours, not days. While both countries have been crippled by disaster, there was a small window for a clean water initiative to take hold in Japan.\n\nLesson #2: The best public health tools are not going to be available.\n\nThere was very little to no waste management in Haiti before the earthquake. In Haiti, the stench of the putrid garbage hanging in the air was even worse than the stench of the open sewage. During a disaster, the waste management is in shambles. After a natural disaster, your best option for waste management may be nothing.\n\nLesson #3: Lead, follow, or get out of the way.\n\nAfter the earthquake, the initial response by the Haitians was self-help, not government response. The government was just as incapacitated as the rest of the people and in some cases, people said that it made matters worse. As noted in this article, the first responders were the Haitians themselves. Then the international community, led by the United States, stepped in and began to take over.\n\nLesson #4: Be more pragmatic.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared cholera to be a global epidemic and established an emergency response plan for countries around the world. Haiti was on the list of countries to receive support. That response was to install hand pumps to collect water. The problem is that only about half of the pumps had been installed when the earthquake struck. In Haiti, the people said that they were more than happy to have the hand pumps installed, but they didn’t need them until after the earthquake.\n\nLesson #5: People’s lives will be saved in Haiti and Japan by leveraging the private sector.\n\nIn Haiti, many non-governmental organizations did not have enough money to fund their projects. At the same time, the countries did not have the money to fund the projects. They worked together and leveraged private funding to fund the project and then provide technical support to run the project.\n\nLesson #6: Don’t make the people in need the focus.\n\nThe focus in Haiti was on cholera. It became the priority of the Haitian government to address the disease. The result was that the Haitian people had to wait for government support.\n\nLesson #7: Planning for disaster is the best insurance against the future.\n\nWe must plan for the worst case scenario and hope for the best case scenario. If we only plan for the best case scenario, we will be unprepared for the worst case scenario. A well-planned disaster response will limit the chances of a long-term disaster.\n\nLesson #8: A “quick” solution can become the long-term problem.\n\nIn Haiti, the quick fix was for the cholera outbreak was to spray bleach to sterilize the water. Unfortunately, the bleach only helps if the water is highly contaminated. Even if it was highly contaminated, the Haitians only needed to boil the water for a few minutes to make it safe for drinking. The irony of spraying bleach on the water was that it could have been a good solution to help in a later stage. In Japan, water from the tsunami is being sterilized to be safe for drinking. Once again, the quick fix could have been a good long-term solution.\n\nLesson #9: There is no such thing as a quick fix.\n\nWith the influx of money and help from the international community, the Haitian government quickly put together a program that was supposed to provide clean water to everyone in the affected area. That program was estimated to cost $20 million. There were 6,000 people living in tent camps who needed clean water. After seven months, the project was abandoned with only a handful of people getting clean water. There is no such thing as a quick fix in Haiti.\n\nLesson #10: Money, money, money.\n\nThe primary reason that the water program was abandoned was money. It was simply too expensive to provide clean water to all the Haitians.\n\nLesson #11: Don’t start with the simple stuff.\n\nHaiti needed more than clean water. It needed medical care, food, shelter, and protection. Clean water may have been something that could have been added after the situation was stabilized.\n\nLesson #12: Waiting is never the answer.\n\nHaiti will need at least $5 billion to rebuild. The wait for that money could take years. They will need it now. That is what happens when you have a country with over 70 percent of the population living on less than $2 a day.\n\nLesson #13: The human spirit is strong.\n\nPeople in Haiti persevered through the disaster. That is what I admire most about them. They are a very resilient people.\n\nLesson #14: We need to prepare for the next disaster.\n\nHow do you prepare for the next disaster? The best way is to have a ready supply of ready to use water stored at home. The next best way is to have your own filtration system. Then you can make sure your family has clean water in the event of a disaster.\n\nThe best way to prepare is to have enough water to last at least three days. You may not be able to find bottled water or you may not have time to boil your water. It is good to have enough water to survive the first few days without having to depend on bottled water or someone else.\n\nDo you think we are prepared for the next disaster?\n\n[Image by U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Janelle W.

"The following comments by Army Staff Sgt. Jesse Lyn Branch, winner of the Victoria Cross, were made on Sunday to an Associated Press reporter, shortly before a tour of the main Commonwealth Cemetery at Ypres, where more than 35,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers are buried. The tour was part of the visit of the Prime Minister, the Right Honorable Edward P. Mulgan, the first Australian Prime Minister to visit Europe since the end of World War II.\n\nThe visit to the British Cemetery was an emotional moment. As the VIP's stood there and paid their respects to the many soldiers who had died, the battlefield layed silent and peaceful.\n\nFor a brief moment I felt as if I was back in the trenches once more, holding back the line. But as I looked around the desolate field and observed the many names on the headstones, I couldn't help but to think of the fact that this place was in fact a killing field. It was an eerie feeling that I couldn't shake. A feeling that I was caught up in a moment that had happened so long ago, but still was quite vivid in my mind.\n\nAlthough I had been to Ypres many times before, I had never stopped to think about what this place had been like during the First World War. I had never really given much thought to the numbers of soldiers who had died here. I'd never stopped to think about what their lives had been like and what had brought them here to this place. I knew they had been here. I knew there had been fighting here, but I had never given the impression that these soldiers were anything more than a body count. This is where my journey really began. This was the beginning of my education in what the War had been like.\n\nAs I walked across the cemetery to a group of VC recipients, I felt as if I had suddenly been transported back into the past. It was almost as if I could feel the wind against my face, and the sound of the bombs as they fell. It was almost as if I could smell the gunpowder. This was a surreal feeling, and as I walked amongst the graves, I felt as if I was intruding on a moment that should have been left alone, preserved forever in time.\n\nI walked from headstone to headstone and read the inscriptions. I felt as if I was reading the names of soldiers who were my friends, men I had gone to war with. Names I recognized. The names of soldiers I had fought and shared danger with. This was all real. The feelings I was experiencing were all real, and they were very strong. These men were not just a body count. They were real people with real lives. They had been alive and breathing at one point, and here I was, walking amongst their graves, visiting their final resting places.\n\nAs I moved through the cemetery I realized that the bodies of the soldiers I had seen in the trenches during the War were most likely lying here. The bodies that had lain in front of me were the very bodies I had stepped over and tried to avoid. The very bodies that had lain in front of me as I dug my way through the trenches. I had seen their faces and seen their blank stares, but never once had I considered what they might have been like in life. Never once had I considered that they might have been people with hopes and dreams, people with lives and families. Never once had I considered that they might have been like me.\n\nThis place gave me an overwhelming feeling of sadness and despair. Sadness for the men who had fallen. Sadness for the men who would soon die. Despair for what the war had done to this beautiful country and to the people who lived here. The war had been so devastating that it made me feel sad for all of the future generations that would never see this place the way it was before the war. This place had been ripped apart by war, and that made me feel sad. All that was left here now was sorrow and loss. A place filled with memories of those who had died, those who had suffered, and those who had been lost.\n\nAs I left the cemetery and walked back toward the jeeps that were to take us to the Australian cemetery, I looked back at the graves. I had never once seen them this way, but I felt like I had just received an education on a subject that I had never thought I would see. For a brief moment, I had been educated in the nature of war. I had learned about what it had been like. I had learned about the deaths of these men. I had learned about their sacrifices, and the sacrifices that had been made for them. I had learned about what they had gone through, and the things they had done. I had been educated in what it had been like to fight in the First World War.\n\nThe tour left me with a new understanding of the Great War. I had come to a place where soldiers had come from all over the world to fight for their countries. Men from France, from the Netherlands, from Germany, from Canada, from England, and from Australia. I had seen the graves of all these men, and now I understood their reasons for fighting. It had been an education. An education in what the War had been like. An education in why these men had gone to war. An education in their hardships and their sacrifices. An education in their determination. An education in the fact that these men were real people with real lives.\n\nYpres had been an overwhelming experience. I have been here many times before, but never had I had the opportunity to view the town in such a different light. Never had I had the chance to realize the scope of what the War had been like. Never had I had the opportunity to see this place as it was so long ago. I had seen the monuments and the buildings, but never had I seen the War.

Thompson, wrote in a follow-up letter to the original.\n\n\"Our stock has performed so consistently well for so long, that the temptation to weave a web of fiction around it is understandable,\" he said. \"Our job is to ignore the weaving and focus on the facts and the future.\"\n\nThompson provided an excerpt of the letter to CNBC, which says in part:\n\n\"My hope is that you're on the verge of declaring a national emergency to break up the banks, use the FDIC to buy equity in the banks, give debt forgiveness to homeowners, and have the government issue each American a lifetime guaranteed income of $25,000.\"\n\n\"We are in the midst of a dying civilization, where self-serving financiers, politicians and corporations are pillaging all the resources, making the citizens serfs, and impoverishing the nation.\"\n\nThompson said that Buffett was not responsible for responding to every letter, but in this case, he decided to weigh in.<|endoftext|>Harry's P.O.V\n\nI'm Harry Styles from One Direction!\n\nAt this moment in my life I'm happy.

JUST HOW EASY IT IS GOING TO BE TO CLOSE A DEAL, LESS THAN A MONTH BEFORE THE VOTES ARE COUNTED AT THE ELECTION S, IS A BIG QUESTION.\n\nRussia said today that it is negotiating with other international players to end its military intervention in Syria. The statement followed an appeal from the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, for Vladimir Putin to help end the conflict.\n\nThe Kremlin denied that Russia was withdrawing forces, but said that it was “natural” to consider the options as the end of the fight against Islamic State draws closer.\n\nThe Russian president and his US counterpart, Barack Obama, have been unable to agree on a plan to coordinate their military intervention, but Moscow is concerned that this could leave Russia’s warplanes vulnerable to western forces. Russia is looking for a way to make sure that its strategic and military interests are protected in any new plan to end the Syrian conflict.\n\nMany western analysts say that Russia has been searching for a way out of the Syrian conflict for more than a year, as the casualties of the fighting have mounted, but have concluded that they do not have a workable exit strategy.\n\n“This may be a sign that Russia is more serious about bringing an end to the war than it has appeared, but it is too early to be sure,” said Michael Cecire, a research analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n\nSyria has been in turmoil since 2011, when anti-government protests escalated into a civil war between rebels and government forces. Russia has been at the forefront of military support for the Assad regime since 2015, when it began launching airstrikes in the country.\n\nRussia had hoped to make the “war on terror” the focal point of a new Russian foreign policy in the Middle East, but Mr Assad has proved to be a much more complex ally than the Kremlin had expected. Russia’s only remaining hope now is to force a political solution that will allow its troops to depart with some dignity.\n\nPresident Putin’s first attempt to broker a peace plan with Turkey in 2016 collapsed when the rebels in Syria, backed by Russia, insisted on Assad’s resignation as part of a political solution.\n\nPutin’s attempt to broker a new plan at the G20 summit in Germany in July was unsuccessful, but analysts say it has given Moscow some confidence that it could play a role in any future agreement.\n\nWestern diplomats say that it is too early to talk about a political solution, with Russia and the regime controlling more than 60% of Syrian territory and the remaining opposition, mostly based in the northwest and the northeast of the country, forced to rely on Turkish support for survival.\n\nThe best that Russia can hope for now is that the rebels will agree to negotiate from a position of weakness, having seen their military forces driven from the south and the west.<|endoftext|>Ankara: Syria has moved chemical weapons to its largest city, amid international concerns about a possible American-led strike in response to a suspected chemical attack that killed hundreds in Damascus.\n\nForeign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in an interview with state-run TRT television on Monday that there are \"concrete\" signs of the movement of Syria's chemical weapons stocks and that he expects more information about their locations to emerge. He said Turkey was sharing this information with allied countries and the international community.\n\nMr Davutoglu didn't say where the weapons are allegedly being moved, or give any indication of how Turkey's allies would respond to the news.\n\nTurkey is a staunch opponent of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and hosts more than 120,000 Syrian refugees on its territory.\n\nMr Davutoglu also said the Turkish parliament will vote on a request to allow Turkish troops to go to foreign countries, including Syria. Parliament is expected to approve the request when it convenes later on Monday.\n\nUS officials have said they are preparing possible military action against Syria after accusing the Assad government of launching a chemical attack on its own people last week that killed hundreds of civilians, including children.\n\nTurkey has a 900km border with Syria.\n\nMr Davutoglu warned that any military action against Syria must not violate international law.\n\n\"We are disturbed by the possibility of a unilateral military operation outside the UN framework,\" he said.\n\nTurkey is a member of NATO, which has vowed to support a member state under attack, but hasn't said whether that support would be military.\n\nMr Davutoglu said the Turkish parliament will vote on whether to allow Turkish troops to go into Syria if international forces led by the US launch a military operation there.\n\n\"We are not thinking about the issue of war,\" he said.\n\n\"In the event of a threat to Turkey or a Turkish citizen, Turkey will take all measures and the necessary steps to ensure its own security,\" he said.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Syria's ally Russia said the chemical attack last week appeared to be a provocation.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Moscow that the attack would have been impossible to carry out without a \"powerful external assistance.\"\n\nHe accused the US and its allies of attempting to use the attack as a justification for military action against the Assad regime.\n\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told the Security Council that the world cannot wait for a diplomatic solution to the Syrian crisis, saying that the international community is speaking with one voice on the need for a military response.\n\n\"Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk of more attacks,\" she said. \"Bashar al-Assad must know that he will be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons and that the rest of the world will be watching.\"\n\nMs Power also challenged Syria's claim that the rebels were responsible for the attack, saying there is \"no question that an atrocity occurred.\"\n\nThe president of the council, Brazilian Ambassador Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, said the council will \"start a more in-depth study\" of the situation in Syria on Tuesday.\n\nAP<|endoftext|>I bought a Groupon for this place and had the same mixed experience as the previous review.

Ainda de acordo com o presidente, existe o risco de que esse vazamento sirva para que outros hackers usem as informações para obter recursos em um futuro não tão distante.\n\nA preocupação do presidente tem como base a lei do paciente alemã, que garante o direito ao sigilo médico.\n\nA situação é tão grave, que a Associação Médica de Saarbrücken, onde o roubo aconteceu, ainda tem que informar cada uma das vítimas, e as autoridades precisam investigar as circunstâncias do roubo.\n\nComo o roubo aconteceu?\n\nO roubo aconteceu no dia 28 de janeiro de 2019, quando um estranho pediu para a faxineira entrar no laboratório, e que entregasse as senhas da administração do local. Depois de as senhas serem entregues, a administração foi desligada do resto da instituição e foi ao encontro do hacker.\n\nNa hora que o hacker chegou ao local, a pessoa ligada à administração foi ao banheiro, e aproveitou o momento em que o hacker tinha acesso às informações. Então, ela foi chamada por um colega que trabalhava perto do local, e aproveitou o momento para acessar o banheiro. E, naquele momento, foi quando ela enviou as informações para o celular do hacker, de acordo com a empresa que possui o laboratório, a BioNET.\n\nApesar do incidente, a administração segue firme e forte. “Não vamos cair na fraqueza. Vamos não apenas fazer frente ao problema, mas também ainda colocar a instituição em funcionamento.” A declaração é do diretor-geral da BioNET, Jörg-Dieter Hoffmann, que ainda acrescentou: “Não sabemos ainda qual será o impacto dessa violação, e se deverá haver danos aos pacientes.”\n\nComo é o sistema de segurança de dados da Amazon?\n\nA Amazon já foi criticada diversas vezes por causa do sistema de segurança de dados.

It also prohibited a terrorist organisation from operating under a different name, and authorised the Minister of Justice to request the removal of an organisation from the register if it had stopped functioning.\n\nKhan had earlier introduced a private member's bill which became the \"Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 2002\". This Act extended the period of detention without trial to a maximum of 12 months.\n\nArdeshir Khan was born on 11 October 1956 in Labasa, Fiji. His father, Krishna Khan, came from the Fiji Islands, and his mother, Seeta Khan, came from India. He has a brother, Parveen Khan.\n\nKhan is a former government servant. In December 2001, he was a teacher at the Yadavindra Public School in Lautoka. He left this post in June 2004 to stand for election in the Suva City Council election.\n\nKhan won the Labasa Indian Communal Constituency, one of the two seats reserved for Fiji citizens of Indian origin, for the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) in the House of Representatives in the parliamentary elections of 2001. He had previously unsuccessfully contested the Labasa Fijian Communal Constituency for the FLP in the general election of 1999. He won with 57.8 percent of the vote, defeating the candidate of the Conservative Alliance, who obtained 40.6 percent.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Khan successfully moved the \"Prevention of Terrorism (Special Provisions) Bill 2001\", supported by the government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. The Bill, which became known as the \"Anti-Terrorism Bill 2001\", amended the \"Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) 1997\" to extend the period of detention without trial to a maximum of 18 months, and established a register of convicted terrorists.

This Act extended the period of detention without trial to a maximum of 12 months.\n\nKhan was a supporter of Qarase, and defended the controversial Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, which sought to establish a commission to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the Fiji coup of 2000. He maintained that the Bill did not pardon perpetrators of crimes, but rather provided for the payment of compensation to victims. He was a supporter of the legislation in a party meeting in Labasa. When he raised the issue, he was supported by party leader Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nIn October 2002, Khan condemned the actions of three policemen who tried to forcibly enter a home in Nausori, near Suva, and drag out a man who was inside. Khan called the actions of the policemen \"a barbaric show of violence\". The police, who had arrived in an unmarked vehicle, were looking for two men who had been charged with weapons offences.\n\nIn January 2003, Khan and other MPs and Senators condemned the United States military action in Iraq, calling it a \"war of aggression\".\n\nKhan lost his seat in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections.\n<|endoftext|>The Affair at the Victory Ball\n\nThe Affair at the Victory Ball is a novel by English author Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 1 February 1937 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00.\n\nThe plot revolves around the wife of a man who committed suicide, who then marries the man whom she believes to be the killer. He turns out to be a murderer and, following a dinner party at their house, she is murdered. The title is taken from a poem by A. E. Housman, \"When the lamp is shattered\", from \"A Shropshire Lad\".\n\nThe \"Times Literary Supplement\" of 3 February 1937, in a favourable review, concluded: \"The subject is in its very nature one that cannot be dealt with without crudity. Mrs. Christie has succeeded in handling it, if not with delicate tact, at any rate with discretion. The reader is not repelled by any insistence on horror.\" The reviewer for \"The Guardian\" of 1 February 1937, was also positive, writing, \"Agatha Christie has done what few women novelists have had the courage to do – treated frankly, with detachment, and almost scientific detachment, of a subject which is very near to all women's hearts. Mrs. Christie is much more than a detective story writer; she is a social psychologist.\"\n\nIn 1963, the novel was the third to be dramatized in the anthology series \"The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes\", starring Margaret Lockwood in the lead role. Christie adapted the novel herself.\n\nIn 1973, the novel was adapted for a British television series starring David Niven and Joanna David.\n\nIn 1995, the novel was adapted for an American television movie starring Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel.\n\n\"The Affair at the Victory Ball\" was first serialised in the US in \"Collier's Weekly\" in six parts from 18 August to 22 September 1936, and in the UK in the \"London Evening News\" in six instalments from 1 August to 12 August 1937. In 1938, the novel was also serialised in Australia in the \"Women's Weekly\".\n\n\nThe novel was adapted into a British television film in 1973.\n\n<|endoftext|>Black River (Livonia, New York)\n\nThe Black River is a river that flows through the towns of Livonia and Pembroke, New York.

"One way to manage the first challenge is to leverage the power of strategic framing. That's a fancy term for influencing the lens through which people interpret a situation. The notion of strategic framing is not new; businesses and political campaigns have used it for years. Consider how both candidates approached the national debt: Obama's framing was debt as a \"ticking time bomb\"; Romney's was that a healthy economy will help reduce it.\n\nWhich of the two frames resonates with you more? Or more importantly, which of the two frames would make you want to vote for the person who used it?\n\nWhile both frames provide information that is factual, only one frame is powerful enough to be effective. The important thing is not which frame you personally agree with, but which frame the audience responds to. After all, the audience votes.\n\nIn our work with business leaders, we've discovered that as they grow in their career, they often become victims of their own success. As they accumulate more responsibilities, they are exposed to more and more complex issues. As they work through these complex issues, they create new solutions that provide competitive advantage to their companies. Unfortunately, these solutions are often misunderstood by the audience. Sometimes, they are actively opposed because of miscommunication or misinterpretation. And that's when a leader's work goes from bad to worse.\n\nThis doesn't mean that a leader needs to dumb down his or her message or spend more time with the audience. It means that a leader needs to reframe the situation or issue so that it can be understood and supported. And the best time to do this is before you put a solution in motion. That way, the solution can be implemented and understood, not in opposition, but in support.\n\nSometimes, a leader's job is to effectively reframe the audience's point of view. That's how leaders lead. And that's how the best of them succeed.<|endoftext|>Movies can help us understand history in a very personal way.

Once this is done, I'm able to ping the IP of the VM from my own computer. From there, I'm able to remotely manage the server from the \"virtual machine management\" window in Hyper-V Manager, and I can open up a PowerShell console on the server (and do other things with it as well).

Cleveland won 106-98. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nNEW YORK — James stepped over the scorer’s table to sit down on the court.\n\nA night after their season ended with a loss in the most painful way, the Cavaliers showed the Knicks they had a little fun.\n\nLeBron James scored 32 points in his first game against New York since the Cavaliers rallied from a 3-1 deficit in the finals, and Cleveland ended a three-game losing streak by beating the Knicks 106-98 on Tuesday night.\n\nTristan Thompson scored a season-high 23 points for the Cavaliers, who finished with a winning record (45-31) for the first time since James’ return in 2014-15.\n\nCleveland came into the game having lost four of six.\n\n“I mean, obviously, it was a tough loss,” James said. “But for us to come out here and for our guys to play the way they played, it was good for us.”\n\nKevin Love scored 12 and Kyrie Irving added 10 for the Cavs, who never trailed after the first quarter. It was James’ first game against New York since last year’s playoffs.\n\nJ.R. Smith scored 19 points, Courtney Lee had 17, and Kristaps Porzingis finished with 14 points and seven rebounds. The Knicks have lost five straight.\n\nJames had six assists and made 11 of 16 field goals in 33 minutes. He was a game-time decision because of soreness in his left knee.\n\n“It feels great.

"Wagner Brewing Company\n\n1315 W. 8th St., Cincinnati, OH 45203\n\nFor over 130 years, Cincinnati's been known for its beer, and one of the city's oldest breweries is getting a new life, and a new name. Wagner Brewing Company will be a craft brewery at 1315 W. 8th St. in Over-the-Rhine, making an old school lager called 12 Degrees.\n\n\"The recipe for 12 Degrees was brewed back in 1887, and this is a beer that was brewed in the city of Cincinnati for 50 years, and then, because of prohibition, they took it out of production,\" co-owner Sam Landeck said.\n\nBut, this new beer isn't just about history.\n\n\"12 Degrees is a lager, which makes it really smooth,\" co-owner Sam Landeck said. \"It's a beer that everyone can drink.\"\n\nLandeck is one of the three partners who came up with the idea of opening a brewery in Cincinnati. He said their goal is to brew quality, flavorful beer.\n\n\"There are so many great things happening in the city of Cincinnati right now, and we wanted to be a part of that,\" Landeck said. \"We wanted to be a part of the revitalization of Over-the-Rhine, but also being in Cincinnati, Ohio, we wanted to make great beer, and it's the birthplace of beer. Cincinnati is known for beer. There's a great beer history here, and we wanted to be part of that and be known for making good beer.\"\n\nLandeck said he and his partners chose Over-the-Rhine as the location for their brewery because of the city's craft beer boom.\n\n\"There's been such a renaissance in OTR, and it's becoming a destination for a lot of people, and we're a small part of that,\" Landeck said. \"But we're a small part of that renaissance.\"\n\nCincinnati beer advocate Brian Pryor agrees.\n\n\"We are absolutely in the midst of a craft beer boom, so the more the merrier,\" he said.\n\nPryor is a member of the Cincinnati Beer Committee, a group dedicated to promoting the craft beer industry in the area.\n\n\"We're absolutely a craft beer destination,\" he said. \"There's a lot going on in the area, and a lot of people are starting to realize that.\"\n\nThere are about 15 breweries in Cincinnati, and 12 more that are on the way.\n\nLandeck said the craft beer industry in Cincinnati is an exciting place to be right now.\n\n\"The community here is really supportive, and people are really excited about craft beer, and that's something we really enjoy,\" he said.\n\n12 Degrees won't be open until June or July, but when it does open, it will offer a lot of different options.\n\n\"We'll have a lager that's traditional to the Cincinnati area, but we'll also have a blonde ale, and a red ale, and a raspberry beer,\" Landeck said.\n\nSo, how do the owners know 12 Degrees will be a success? Well, because they've been drinking it.\n\n\"We've been making it in the kitchen,\" Landeck said. \"Our friends have been trying it, and they seem to really enjoy it, so we're going to go with it.\"\n\nFor now, the brewery is taking on small investors, but it will eventually expand to produce 10,000 barrels a year.\n\n\"I think people are going to enjoy the beer that we make, and we're excited about it,\" Landeck said. \"We can't wait to open it up, and we're excited to be in Cincinnati.\"<|endoftext|>What's Happening in Kalamazoo?\n\nLooking for something fun to do in Kalamazoo?

And this is why the Secret Service's recent letter to the Nevada GOP, which recently stated that the Service would not protect them from a known danger to their safety, is completely unacceptable.\"\n\n\"The day after a second Obama election, it will be time to turn the tables,\" he continued. \"It will be time to deny Obama and his cronies the privilege of anonymity. It will be time to stigmatize the lawless Obama minions in the public square.\"\n\n\"If they won't answer the call to service when they are needed to protect the life of an American president, perhaps they will respond to the call to service when they are needed to protect the American public from a runaway president,\" he added.\n\n[H/T: Media Matters]<|endoftext|>What is the Republic of Tatarstan's 'magnetic policy' for federal center?\n\nThe Republic of Tatarstan has developed and successfully implements a ‘magnetic policy’ for the federal center, the republic's President, Rustam Minnikhanov, said at the annual general meeting of Tatneft on Tuesday.\n\n\"The project of a magnetic policy for the federal center was implemented during my term.

(Note that the area\n\naround the bridge is currently undergoing a resurgence of hydraulic mining.\n\nThe Central Pacific had used some 5 million cubic feet of stone for the construction of the famous \"Big Four\" tunnel\n\nnear Summit, and near Sacramento the new Central Pacific had completed the impressive Red Rock tunnel.\n\nHowever, the sudden availability of cheap power and materials led to the\n\ncompany's decision to abandon plans to build the huge viaduct\n\nby hand, and to simply contract with a well-known contractor\n\nwho had already installed a hydraulicking operation in the\n\nDunsmuir vicinity.\n\nIn addition to the contract for the construction of the viaduct,\n\nWilliam Hammond, the new owner of the hydraulic mining\n\nrights, was to be the contractor of the viaduct construction.\n\nSome of Hammond's rivals were outraged, for they had previously\n\nexpressed their willingness to bid as much as twice as much for\n\nthe contract. Nevertheless, there was apparently no formal\n\nopposition to the awarding of the contract, and in 1867 work\n\nwas begun.\n\nHammond purchased the canyon in 1866 and was granted a special\n\nact of the State Legislature to permit the damming of the\n\nSacramento River and the flooding of the canyon in order to\n\nenable the entire valley to be utilized as a reservoir for\n\nmining purposes. The mining claims were in a variety of hands,\n\nbut Hammond was the biggest individual holder of these rights.\n\nHe started his activities in the canyon in 1865 by building a\n\nwooden flume to transport water to his sawmill. A year later he\n\nbuilt a tunnel to his sawmill, but in 1867 he was employing\n\nover a hundred men at the dam, and at the time of his death in\n\n1867 he was transporting over 70,000 cubic feet of water a day\n\nto his sawmill and to his hydraulic plant.\n\nThe contract for the Dunsmuir Viaduct was let in March 1867.\n\nHammond contracted with Alpheus C. Mason for the construction\n\nof the viaduct. Mason, from Ithaca, New York, had been trained\n\nas a civil engineer and was an experienced hydraulic miner.\n\nHis crew, known as \"Mason's White Terrors\", was a family operation,\n\nwith both men and women working side by side in the hydraulic\n\nand tunnel operations.\n\nHammond would set up his temporary dam at the tunnel, and\n\nMason would build his temporary roadbed and trestle. As soon as\n\nthe water was let into the tunnel and the dam lowered, Mason's\n\ncrew would be on the site, working feverishly to complete the\n\nviaduct before the flooding of the dam caused the earth to lose\n\nits stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawings prepared for the construction of the Dunsmuir Viaduct\n\n\n\n\n\nMason's crew was well versed in building bridges. Working\n\nwith a gang of 700, Mason's gang completed the viaduct in\n\nonly twelve days, and the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific\n\nRailroads began using the viaduct immediately. The viaduct\n\nstill stands today, although since the entire valley is now the\n\nproperty of the state, it is no longer in use for railroad purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. C. Mason\n\nWilliam Hammond\n\nNo official records exist of the cost of the viaduct, but William Hammond's biographer says he spent\n\n$180,000 to construct the viaduct. Other accounts say the cost was about $160,000. The work was\n\ncompleted in less than two months, an incredible feat.\n\nOnly a few years later, William Hammond died, and the amount of money his heirs received was estimated\n\nto be over $3,000,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is Copyright © 1995 by Stephen F.

"What I'd really like to know is this: How come you're able to read articles from unknown websites, that are part of large organizations that write articles, yet I can't? I guess the first thing you could do is ask yourself: Is it really something worth arguing about? You see, every single school or system has done that at some point.\n\nWhile we're looking at some of the local sex offenders in Maine, why don't you read up on the state's Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act? It's been a law since 1992, and it requires sex offenders to register with local law enforcement.\n\nWe know that I'm clearly not a cheerleader. It makes no sense to cheer for a particular team. Once I had actually considered it. For example, I'm from New York.\n\nThat's it, though. The police. This gives me the opportunity to explore a new city and see what there is to do.\n\nThey are responsible for maintaining a list of registered sex offenders and displaying it in a conspicuous location. So, yes, it is fair to say that I hate it when they do that. As we're talking about new local news articles and breaking news, why don't you consider looking at what they have on their site? It's not fair, and it's also very prejudiced. You know, I like to be proud of who I am.\n\nI'm not even going to start talking about my job. I live in a small town. Not a whole lot.\n\nWhile I was trying to figure out if this was okay or not, I realized something: I was actually on my phone while driving. I try to find a balance between work and home life, and also stay active on the weekends. I could only stand it for so long, though. My mother used to tell me I'm too nice for my own good.\n\nAs much as I hate going to court, I know it's part of the job. Well, he told me he wouldn't wear it. Now, as we look at what the New York Times has to offer us, why don't you take a look at their Breaking News? Some of my family and friends might be surprised to hear this, but I don't spend that much time on social media.\n\nI guess the first thing you could do is ask yourself: Is it really something worth arguing about? I'm not even going to start talking about my job.<|endoftext|>\"You have to tell us what your first impressions are, Jim,\" Aidy replied with some mirth.\n\nThe effect on the gang was comic—mirth on one side and blank bewilderment on the other.\n\nI was delighted to find myself in a strange, yet familiar land, of whose language I was master, but in which I felt a ludicrous want of power.\n\nHe could not take his eyes from her; the mirth in them was wholly hers.\n\nMirth and music had been missing from the King's Court for a long time.\n\n\"You are kind, indeed,\" she said, with a smile which made it plain that the mirth was still in her mind.\n\nThen she stole away to her own room, and there, by the light of a single tallow candle, she laughed until she cried for the mirth of it all.\n\nThe spectators applauded the deftness of the execution, but the mood of mirth did not deepen.\n\nThus, he ends with a general invitation to his mirthless compatriots to rouse themselves, and give them a good beating.\n\nThey had travelled out of Italy with him, and when he had reached his own house, they took leave of him with many expressions of joy and mirth.<|endoftext|>Amma’s Oats dosa recipe is great for a light breakfast or evening snack for kids. Packed with the goodness of oats and nutritious chana dal, this dosas are also high in protein.\n\nUsually made with black dal (split black gram) or Bengal gram dal, this is a popular dish of North Karnataka, especially the malnad region. Since I have no clue of the ingredients, my guess is that it may be an offshoot of the well-known erachi sattu (dal cakes) of Karnataka. Whatever it may be, it’s a tasty dish that can be easily prepared at home. Amma’s Oats dosa recipe is quite different from the regular dosas or other dosa variations, both in the taste and texture. This is very soft and spongy and you would almost eat it like a crepe. Oats give this a slightly chewy texture, while the chana dal imparts a mild nutty flavour.\n\nI also tried some variations. I soaked some rice overnight and used the soaked water to grind it. The resulting dosa did not come out so great. It was a little grainy and did not have the spongy texture. The recipe is a little elaborate, but worth the effort. If you have kids, I bet they will love it. Serve with coconut chutney, or any other chutney of your choice.\n\nFor making dosas, this batter requires the grinded lentils to be slightly coarse. This will allow the batter to flow through the griddle or pan in thin films.\n\nCheck out the Oats Dosa recipe.<|endoftext|>Please check this amazing print out at this link: http://www.cafepress.com/scificollective/34808981.\n\nIf you would like to purchase it, please click the “SCI COLLECTIVE” link under the image, enter the required information, and we will send it to you.

But the area was a little busy that day (7/24) with other hikers and day-trippers so we decided to just park at the trailhead and save the 1 mile walk from the parking lot. As a result, we didn't get to see any of the cute animals (though I have no doubt they were out there somewhere) and only saw one other hiker along the way.\n\n\n\nThis trail is located in Pisgah National Forest on the side of Nantahala mountain. It is one of the most difficult trails in the area with sheer drops and rugged terrain.\n\n\n\nThe good: For a more advanced hiker, this is a great trail. It is strenuous but not overly long (5.8 miles). The end is a great waterfall, which is easy to get to if you don't mind getting wet.\n\n\n\nThe not so good: If you are hiking with a family or kids, you'll be facing a very difficult trail that is more dangerous than fun. If you aren't an advanced hiker and you are looking for a scenic hike, this isn't the trail for you.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the trail, you come to a fork in the road. Take a left to begin your hike. Shortly after the trail begins, you will come to a second fork in the road. If you go right, you will be continuing on the AT.\n\n\n\nAfter that, the trail begins to climb at a steady, though not difficult pace. There are numerous points that overlook small streams or the valley below. It is a great trail for experiencing the scenery.\n\n\n\nAbout halfway, the trail reaches the first stream crossing. The trail passes under a stone bridge (that is in remarkably good condition) before crossing the stream. The trail continues, but is a little steep at this point. The good news is that the trail flattens out shortly thereafter and you have to navigate over a few rock formations.\n\n\n\nWhen you reach the intersection with the second stream, the trail is fairly obvious. Take the left fork, which will take you around the falls and to the top of the falls. From here you can see the falls below, which is a huge waterfall that is visible from the valley below.\n\n\n\nFrom the top of the falls, the trail flattens out again. Take the trail to the left to take you over to the base of the falls. There is a rock platform from which you can safely take pictures and view the falls. There are spots that you can stand in the water and enjoy the falls. From the top of the falls, it is about 2 miles back to the trailhead, which is an easy walk.<|endoftext|>KVUE — The city of Austin has seen a rise in hit-and-run accidents, and Thursday night the Austin Police Department warned drivers that, if they are involved in a collision, they should wait for police to arrive before leaving the scene.\n\nA study of reported hit-and-runs, or single-vehicle crashes, between Jan. 1, 2014, and Dec. 31, 2016, shows the number of hit-and-runs increased by 11.3 percent, according to the city of Austin.

The more you contribute to the BOINC network, the larger your share of the PoR supply.\n\nProof-of-Research (PoR)\n\nProof-of-Research, or “Proof-of-Research” is a new, unique algorithm to distribute Gridcoin. The Gridcoin Proof-of-Research algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n\nCryptographic verification of work - The work being submitted has been verified via multiple cryptographic algorithms and is sufficiently difficult.\n\nShare work with BOINC network - The work being submitted is work that has been sent to the BOINC network to be processed.\n\nNetwork weight - The network weight is a continually updated figure that gauges the amount of processing power that the network is contributing to the project.\n\nRecent average credit - This is a metric that is the average amount of BOINC credits that the project you are contributing work to has received recently.\n\nRecent average credit weighs more heavily than network weight in Proof-of-Research. This means that if the project you are contributing work to is having a bad day and not processing as many tasks as usual, you will be less likely to receive research credit than if the network weight was the only determining factor.\n\nBOINC PROJECTS\n\nBOINC is an open-source volunteer oriented distributed computing grid which combines the processing power of all individual users for the purposes of scientific research. It’s free, and harnesses the unused clock cycles from processors and graphics cards to attempt to cure cancer/aids/ebola/malaria, map the milkyway, crack enigma codes, etc..\n\nBOINC user accounts can be viewed on the BOINC web site (https://www.bioinc.ca/en/).\n\nBOINC statistics can be viewed on the BOINCStats web site (http://boincstats.com/en/stats_help.php).\n\nThere are numerous BOINC projects that currently require more processing power than they have available, and so BOINC users may choose to contribute their excess CPU/GPU cycles to any of the currently running projects.

"Dramatic news on the wildfire front this week, as a fire near Chico, California exploded in size over the weekend, swallowing up nearly 26,000 acres and burning through 150 structures. Firefighters have been working around the clock to stop the fire from burning even more, and officials hope to have the fire fully contained by Thursday.\n\nThe fire has forced nearly 6,000 residents to flee the area. Fortunately, so far there have been no reports of serious injuries or loss of life.\n\nThis disaster highlights an ongoing issue of tremendous concern: there is no easy solution for firefighters in situations like these. As fires get more destructive and grow larger, there’s not enough fire equipment to deal with them. What firefighters need is a new breed of firefighting technology.\n\nFor decades, we’ve relied on the same types of water-based firefighting tactics, like water-dropping aircraft and helicopters, to fight fires. Unfortunately, these methods are ineffective against large wildfires.\n\nFirefighters often attempt to use backfires, which are purposely-set fires meant to stop a larger fire’s spread, but these techniques also do not work as well as they once did. Backfires are notoriously dangerous, and as fires get larger, they become too dangerous for firefighters to use.\n\nIn the past, the use of dynamite and chainsaws were also common, but they’re also inefficient.\n\nWater-dropping aircraft are effective, but unfortunately, we don’t have enough of them, and they can’t fight fires in dangerous places like mountainous areas. This is why helicopters, often seen carrying buckets of water, are so useful.\n\nAs wildfires continue to burn larger, more and more people are going to need to be evacuated. We need new, improved tactics for firefighting. In this modern age, it’s not feasible for thousands of people to have to evacuate their homes and businesses on a daily basis, especially since it’s now common for wildfires to burn thousands of acres in a single day.\n\nThis week, I spoke with Nathan Meehan, director of innovation at Global SuperTanker. He told me that his organization’s planes use specialized tank technology to deliver a huge payload of fire retardant.\n\n“Our aircraft is a modified Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, the most fire retardant that has ever been delivered at one time,” he said.\n\nSupertankers can carry up to 12,000 gallons of retardant and make multiple drops from high altitudes, while being guided by skilled pilots.\n\nTo date, Supertanker has helped fight fires in California, Portugal, France and Israel, and they’ve just been authorized to fight fires in Chile.\n\n“We are committed to firefighting, and this fire [in California] really highlights the need for technology like this,” he said. “We believe that Supertankers can stop and prevent large wildfires from spreading as they currently are.”\n\nFirefighters on the ground also need to do a better job at protecting homes and businesses from destruction. Right now, we have a “firefighting gap,” where there aren’t enough firefighters to protect buildings and homes that are threatened by wildfires.\n\nA recent study in California’s Sierra Nevada Foothills found that the “firefighting gap” is getting larger, and that current strategies are not sufficient to protect homes and property. The study concluded that more homes are likely to be lost in wildfires, as well as more money spent to protect homes.\n\nIt’s clear that we need new tactics for fighting fires. It’s time for firefighters to be equipped with the most effective equipment to help them do their job, and new methods need to be implemented to protect homes from loss.\n\nPeter Zalzal is an environmental attorney with EDF.<|endoftext|>Originally published in the October 2007 issue\n\n1.

"PROTESTO DEL CENTRO STUDI PRO LOCO\n\nL’atto illecito messo in atto dalla ditta Perrisa/Castronovo, in relazione alla campagna acquisti di Natale, non ci appare certo una delle più belle trovate natalizie, così come la stessa “trovata” delle quote dei soci pro loco. L’iniziativa, al di là della palese e deliberata truffa a danno della ditta produttrice dei bomboniere e dei giornali, non rispetta i canoni della democrazia, ma va ad inficiare quella democratica gestione, volontaristica, che è alla base delle società del volontariato.\n\nPro loco si fonda infatti sul principio democratico che tutti i soci hanno lo stesso valore, senza alcuna discriminazione o privilegio, e che i loro comportamenti si regolano sempre nel rispetto delle regole della correttezza e del buon senso. Non sempre tutto si svolge ai canoni della correttezza e della legalità, ma la cosa non può mai essere inserita nella politica corrente, ma solo attribuita a pochissimi e impreparati.\n\nA margine vorremmo ricordare una cosa, per chiarezza, nel caso in cui qualcuno avesse qualche dubbio o auspicasse un chiarimento: la realtà dei fatti, infatti, dimostra come nella fase organizzativa delle iniziative relative alla festa del Santo Patrono, che oramai è il 14/9, la società del volontariato, attraverso la presidenza, abbia cercato di dare, almeno nelle intenzioni, il massimo sostegno possibile.\n\nIn tal senso si sono aperte le porte del Centro Studi Pro Loco agli stessi organizzatori, che hanno potuto fruire di tutti i locali e degli spazi a disposizione, in una casa editrice, per pubblicare i manifesti in vista della festa. Ma questo non significa che tutto va bene e che tutto sia in perfetta armonia.

La loro storia inizia nel 2001 quando un gruppo di giovani avvocati si riuniscono e decidono di occuparsi del lavoro dei colleghi impegnati nella contabilità, nella correzione di bozze e nell’analisi giuridica.\n\nMettendo a disposizione il proprio tempo, una propria esperienza di lavoro e le proprie conoscenze e professionalità, iniziano a offrire la propria disponibilità ai colleghi per risolvere le attività più pesanti di lavoro, lasciando così più tempo e dedizione alle pratiche più affascinanti.\n\nSi tratta di un’opportunità per gli avvocati di lasciare per qualche ora il proprio lavoro, permettendo ai propri colleghi di dedicarsi ai propri compiti e alle proprie pratiche.\n\nUno sguardo alla situazione italiana\n\nLa nascita di Tempo Tre Effe Italia è stata però segnata da un’importante innovazione: la rete di assistenza clienti. La filosofia del servizio è di fornire tutti i servizi ai clienti a seconda delle loro esigenze, semplificando i processi di acquisto e risparmiando il loro tempo.\n\nOggi Tempo Tre Effe Italia è diventata una delle principali realtà nel settore della gestione dei lavori, fornendo a tutti i clienti una soluzione personalizzata per migliorare le loro esigenze e risparmiare tempo e denaro.\n\nLa filosofia del lavoro è di garantire il massimo ai clienti con il minor dispendio di tempo e di denaro, senza mai sottostare alle logiche del mercato.\n\nIn un mercato dove il costo delle cose è aumentato e i costi di gestione dei servizi sono sempre più alti, Tempo Tre Effe si pone come una risposta alla necessità di risparmio. Oggi il costo di un’ora di lavoro di un avvocato o un commercialista è molto più alto rispetto a qualche anno fa, spesso più di 100 euro. Il nostro metodo permette di avere un avvocato o un commercialista al costo di 80 euro all’ora.\n\nLe nuove linee guida delle professioni\n\nIl ruolo delle professioni professionali, di tutte quelle professioni che hanno nella loro struttura una figura di fiducia, è di assicurare a tutti la possibilità di risparmiare tempo e denaro, ma anche di sfruttare le conoscenze e le competenze dei professionisti che fanno parte del loro organico.\n\nSappiamo che le professioni professionali sono tra le più rispettate dai cittadini. Se siamo a guardare le linee guida delle professioni professionali, il successo di un professionista deve essere ottenuto attraverso la correttezza, la trasparenza, la competenza, la riservatezza e la cura del cliente.\n\nGli avvocati e i commercialisti, sono tra le più potenti del mercato, con un’esperienza e una conoscenza incredibile e sono anche i più rispettati. Avere a che fare con queste figure professionali, tuttavia, è complicato per molte persone perché richiede tempo, denaro e dedizione, in un periodo in cui tutti questi fattori sono sempre più scarseggiati.\n\nLe professioni professionali devono ora trovare il modo di spostarsi verso nuovi modelli di business. La scelta di sfruttare un modello come quello di Tempo Tre Effe Italia è una grande opportunità per tutti i professionisti, per poter comunicare con un modello di lavoro che riesce a riunire le due esigenze, quella dei professionisti e quella del cliente.\n\nNon esiste ancora una soluzione unica per tutti i professionisti, ma il modello di Tempo Tre Effe Italia è la risposta più attenta alle esigenze delle professioni. In una fase storica in cui tutti i servizi sono per la maggior parte online, in una logica che si sta sviluppando, anche il lavoro dei professionisti dovrà avere un approccio che si sposa con le esigenze del cliente e che riesce a migliorare il proprio modo di lavorare.<|endoftext|>La conferenza di Tokyo è la più grande e importante manifestazione in materia di impatto del cambiamento climatico, oltre che la più vasta occasione per i governi e le aziende a livello mondiale per costruire una piattaforma e condividere il progresso della comunità mondiale in materia di risparmio energetico e di sviluppo sostenibile.<|endoftext|>http://www.ppvmedien.de/Rolling"

It's absolutely a joke. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nAllan (A.J.) MacEachern is talking about the legal dispute between the Saskatchewan Roughriders and veteran slotback Geroy Simon, who has remained on the sidelines during training camp.\n\nIt's the same dispute that has consumed much of the Regina sports media for the past few days, a simmering conflict that has seen accusations of both workplace harassment and age discrimination lobbed at the CFL team.\n\nWhile neither the Roughriders nor Simon would speak publicly Wednesday, it is believed that Simon, who was in a contract year, asked the Roughriders to pay for a personal trainer this season.\n\nThe Riders say no.\n\nSimon says no.\n\nMacEachern says yes.\n\nMacEachern is Simon's agent. He has been for more than a decade, and the two men have become extremely close over that time. When Simon wasn't playing in B.C. during the last two seasons, he spent the off-season in Calgary with MacEachern's family.\n\nThe relationship is so strong that it led to MacEachern's son, Conor, deciding to take a hiatus from his job as a graduate student at Princeton University in order to work with Simon over the past couple of months.\n\nSimon has been one of the CFL's elite receivers for more than a decade.\n\nHe signed a four-year deal with the Roughriders in 2013, but that was before MacEachern started working for the CFL Players' Association. He's now its director of football operations.\n\nAnd he has seen many examples of players being forced to pay for their own services — including trainers.\n\n\"I think it's common,\" he said. \"I think it's standard practice.\n\n\"We have to remember — there's no minimum wage in the CFL. There's no union, either. So what they're doing is perfectly within their rights. And it's not because he's 35. It's just the league in general.\"\n\nMacEachern, who said he speaks to Simon every day, said he couldn't comment on the harassment and age discrimination accusations.\n\n\"That's going to be something that's played out over the course of the year, and if that becomes the story and the narrative of the year, that's going to be a pretty tough one to deal with,\" he said.\n\nThe dispute, though, has drawn plenty of attention, especially after Roughriders head coach Corey Chamblin told reporters on Tuesday that Simon had missed meetings and was no longer a member of the team.\n\nAsked if he was still a member of the Roughriders, Chamblin said: \"Not at this moment.\"\n\nChamblin and general manager Brendan Taman held a news conference Wednesday to try to explain the situation.\n\nTaman said Simon missed three meetings, one of which was on the eve of training camp. He also said the Riders sent Simon's trainer packing.\n\n\"As I sit here today, he is no longer with our organization,\" Taman said. \"That was a decision made.\"\n\nTaman also said that if Simon wasn't in the best shape he could be, then he wouldn't be in the lineup.\n\n\"And I don't think he's in the best shape he can be,\" Taman said. \"If he's not, then he won't play.\"\n\nChamblin added that it would be a \"joke\" for the Riders to pay for Simon's trainer.\n\nMacEachern, though, said that the Roughriders haven't said anything about Simon's weight.\n\n\"They've never mentioned it,\" he said. \"Not once.\"\n\nThe Riders' stance might be different if Simon was under contract. The team doesn't have to pay him if it doesn't want to.\n\n\"When you sign a contract, the way the league works, it's their decision on if they want to release you or not,\" MacEachern said. \"And if they choose to, they pay the rest of the contract. But the first year, they don't have to pay it. They've done that with other players in the past, they're doing it with other players right now.\"\n\nWhat's also interesting about the situation is the fact that Simon is fighting this while a prominent group of players has fought to change the CFL's rules.\n\nThe CFL Players' Association has long lobbied for a cap on salaries, which would allow teams to hold on to more of their money. Currently, teams are allowed to spend to the cap, but a player can ask to be released if he believes he's being underpaid.\n\nA recent study by the CFLPA found that 70 per cent of the league's players were being paid less than $50,000 a season.\n\n\"I don't know the player's situation and whether or not that's a contract that he can get out of or not, and I'm not going to talk about any of the facts or circumstances about what happened,\" MacEachern said.\n\nHe did say, though, that Simon's contract is one of the main reasons for the current rule.\n\n\"That's why they created the rule, because they knew that there were going to be situations like this.\"\n\nmmccormick@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/murraylp<|endoftext|>FDA Seeks Public Comment on New Approach to Antibiotic Use in Animals\n\nCalls for the development of an industry-led program to phase out the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion and feed efficiency\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a draft guidance today seeking comments on new approaches to antibiotic use in food animals.

Mr Smith has discussed the public transport funding the state government will make available as well as the project plans and improvements in the pipeline, according to the NNSWPT. “The key thing is that we’ve talked about is increasing the frequency of buses. We’ve got the fast ferry and the proposed bus network,” he said. “So they’re the two things that are the critical things at the moment. We’re looking at making the buses run faster and more frequently so it’s a more attractive option.” The NNSWPT is currently working on a new bus network for the Tweed. A consultation paper for the network is set to be released later this year. Mr Smith has been working with the organisation on plans for bus and ferry services and other public transport improvements in the Tweed. The NNSWPT said the organisation was keen to address the congestion problems in the area. Mr Smith said the Tweed had a “pretty long way to go” in terms of public transport and he was aware of the lack of services. “The bus is quite difficult to get to the fast ferry,” he said. “I’ve done the bus to Murwillumbah and the buses only run every hour and sometimes they’re very late.” Mr Smith said he had put forward a number of options to the NNSWPT, including an “express bus” to bring people from Tweed Heads to Murwillumbah, where they can then get the fast ferry. “I think that’s a good option and I think we need to look at that,” he said. “It’s a major issue that’s got to be addressed. I’ve put forward"

"Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar compounds which are known as menaquinones. Menaquinones are organic quinones (carbon molecules with two or more covalently bound quinoline rings) and vitamin K. Menaquinones were originally used as dyes.\n\n\n\nIn mammals, vitamin K occurs as a single chemical entity, known as phylloquinone or phylloquinone. Phylloquinone is an alcohol that is readily oxidized and is inactive as a vitamin. It must be reduced in the body to form active menaquinones, including MK-4 and MK-7.\n\n\n\nNattoPharma's unique product lines are produced under an exclusive contract manufacturing agreement with CheilJedang, a Korean company. The company is a leader in the nutraceutical industry.\n\n\n\nNattoPharma's process begins with raw material testing in the laboratory. Our partners at CheilJedang cultivate the highest quality of natto in Korea, according to their standards of excellence, which conform to the guidelines of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These standards of excellence meet or exceed Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).\n\n\n\nCheilJedang uses FDA approved technology to extract phylloquinone from natto, which is then purified and converted to MK-4 and MK-7. The manufacturing facility meets the highest quality and food safety standards.\n\n\n\nMK-7 is available in the forms of anhydrous powder and microcrystalline capsules. All of NattoPharma's products meet the strict standards of GMP.<|endoftext|>I purchased an Acer Aspire 5920 from Best Buy in New Jersey back in July 2009. The machine had 2.53 gig processor and 4 gig of RAM. I bought it specifically to run the 64 bit version of Windows 7 when it was available.\n\n\n\nI did upgrade the hard drive to a 1 TB drive at a later date and I replaced the wireless card. I did not upgrade the RAM.\n\n\n\nAfter about 8 months the machine started running slow and the sound stuttered at times. I went to Acer's site and found that there was an updated BIOS for my machine. I downloaded and installed the update.\n\n\n\nI went back to Acer's site a little later and found that there was also a BIOS update for the hard drive. This was great since I had already replaced the original hard drive with a larger 1 TB drive. The update also told me that I could do a \"secure erase\" of the drive.\n\n\n\nI downloaded and installed the update and then \"secure erased\" the drive. It worked great. The machine was running a lot faster and the sound wasn't stuttering anymore.\n\n\n\nI got back to Acer's site and found that there was also a BIOS update for the wireless card. I downloaded and installed that update too.\n\n\n\nAll was good for about another month. Then the machine started running slow again. I went back to Acer's site and discovered that there was yet another BIOS update for my machine.\n\n\n\nThis is when I got angry. I went back to the site of the original manufacturer of my laptop and the machine still showed that it had the original BIOS on it. I guess they didn't bother to update it.\n\n\n\nI went to the site of the original manufacturer and did a BIOS update on the machine myself. It worked fine for about a month.\n\n\n\nThen the machine started running slow again. I'm sure I could have done another BIOS update, but I didn't bother. Instead I bought a new machine.\n\n\n\nI have since learned that Acer never bothered to upgrade the BIOS on the machine. All the updates were done by other manufacturers. They are all now getting sued for not performing their duty of updating their BIOS and their failure to warn customers that the BIOS would not be updated and that it could cause their machines to run slow and/or have trouble with the wireless card.\n\n\n\nI have since been able to get $50 for the laptop from the landfill in my town. It still runs, but very slowly.\n\n\n\nI have also learned that some people think that just because a laptop has been \"Secure Erased\" that it has been \"re-initialized\" as if it were new. This is not the case. It only removes the file system and makes the drive ready to accept a new one.\n\n\n\nIt has been a month now and I have not been able to re-use the hard drive. My wife found a link to a site that could do a free scan of the hard drive and tell you if it has been re-initialized.\n\n\n\nWe were able to get the hard drive that we had in our old machine (after it died), and \"Secure Erase\" it. It's a smaller drive, but it works and it is better than nothing. We could also have done a data transfer from the old drive, but it would have been a huge pain to re-install all the programs we use.\n\n\n\nIt is a lot of work to deal with a laptop that you cannot re-use.\n\n\n\nDon't ever do a \"Secure Erase\" of your laptop drive unless you are able to test it and make sure that it has actually been \"re-initialized\".\n\n\n\nWe are now buying laptops from Hewlett Packard.<|endoftext|>3Com Corporation is announcing the release of the latest product in its wireless product family, the Wireless Media Bridge.

We are working toward a “No Violence Alliance” which will include the five counties in our chapter and include an understanding that we are one family with shared goals. The way that it will work is that each county in our chapter will create a planning committee and then work to develop a local plan with several goals to create a no violence alliance.\n\nWe have had some great success in the last few years. We have helped local officials understand mental health and the need to work with it in developing better strategies in the community. We have helped our communities create mental health courts, and have worked to reduce jail time for those suffering from mental illness. We have worked to improve treatment and medications for those suffering from severe mental illness, and we have made great strides in understanding the stigma of mental illness.<|endoftext|>There’s nothing like a warm dish of vegetarian lasagna to please a crowd.

"The White House declined on Wednesday to confirm whether it believes the Iran nuclear agreement was legally binding, the latest in a series of clarifications made after the White House found itself mired in confusion over its own stance.\n\n\"You're free to call it whatever you want,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said when asked about the administration's stance on the deal.\n\nThe response is the latest in a string of similar comments made by officials after the White House found itself mired in confusion last week over its stance on the deal.\n\nIn the past week, the White House has said the deal is binding, that it's not binding and that it's dependent on Iran's behavior.\n\nOn Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry referred to the deal as a \"political commitment.\"\n\nEarnest, meanwhile, maintained on Wednesday that it is \"indisputable\" that Iran is in compliance with the agreement.\n\n“Our view has been clear, and has been consistent from the beginning: The way that you judge the success of this deal is by its results,” he said. “It’s indisputable that the international community, including the IAEA, has a much better understanding today of the scope of Iran’s nuclear program than they did before the deal was negotiated. And in that context, there is no evidence that they have been in material breach of the deal.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Earnest said the U.S. was committed to the \"the deal’s successful implementation.\"\n\nAnd last week, he said the deal was \"binding\" and that the U.S. has a \"pretty good idea\" that Iran is not in violation of its commitments.\n\nBut just a few days earlier, another White House spokesman said it was not a binding agreement and that it was up to Iran to prove it was in compliance.<|endoftext|>A Brooklyn firefighter has been arrested for child pornography after he was caught having sex with an underage girl in a vacant house in July, police said.\n\nA neighbor called the cops to a vacant house on 60th Street in Brooklyn, New York, at around 8:40 a.m. on July 18 after he spotted a man and a woman having sex in a hallway of the home, according to a criminal complaint obtained by the New York Post.\n\nPolice arrived at the scene and caught 51-year-old William Masso — a 15-year FDNY veteran and EMT — having sex with the 16-year-old girl, the Post reports.\n\nThe girl was later revealed to be an alleged runaway, according to police.\n\nThe New York City Fire Department announced Masso’s suspension without pay on Wednesday.\n\n“FDNY is aware of an arrest by the NYPD,” a fire department spokesman said in a statement obtained by The Post. “We are monitoring the case closely and have suspended the individual.”\n\nMasso has been charged with criminal sexual act, criminal sex act, sexual abuse, forcible touching, endangering the welfare of a child, and possession of child pornography.

Despite a substantial military, India has suffered from a relative lack of geopolitical success.\n\n– Europe is the wealthiest part of the world but its strategic position is increasingly under question. It is seeking to reform its defense structures but remains relatively dependent on the United States for its security.\n\n– The Middle East is the center of the current geopolitical crisis. The region has been wracked by conflict, instability, and massive displacement of people. While it is at the center of the crisis, it is also at the center of great power ambitions.\n\n– Africa is being pulled in several different directions. The scramble for Africa is real. Countries like China and Russia are seeking influence on the continent, and the United States is trying to preserve its traditional role.\n\n– Latin America has largely escaped the impact of the current geopolitical crisis but this might not last for long.\n\n– Geopolitics is changing and becoming more complicated. One reason for this is the rise of new powers, like China and Russia. Another is the return of geopolitics after decades of neglect.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGeopolitics is the study of the distribution of power in the international system. The term \"geopolitics\" was first used in the early 19th century, by a Prussian student named Friedrich Ratzel. Ratzel saw geopolitics as a branch of political science, concerned with the power relationships between different countries. The study of geopolitics is based on a simple premise: Where power is located, there is political importance. This principle was not lost on the great European powers that competed for colonies and spheres of influence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the term \"geopolitics\" fell out of fashion, eclipsed by the term \"international relations.\" But the fall of the Soviet Union led to a change in the international system. The United States emerged as the world's dominant power, a position that had a profound impact on the countries of the world. Some, like China, Russia, and Iran, sought to challenge the United States, while others, such as Mexico and Canada, largely acquiesced to the new reality. At the same time, globalization and the rise of the Internet created new economic and social opportunities. These new opportunities undermined the power of many of the world's countries. And they exposed the limits of the United States as the sole superpower, even as its strength grew relative to other countries.\n\nThe 21st century is reshaping the world. This report aims to understand the consequences of this change. It discusses the three main arenas in which geopolitical competition takes place. It also identifies the major powers in each region, and how they are likely to compete in the future.\n\n\"Where power is located, there is political importance.\"\n\nTo understand geopolitics, it is useful to think of the world as divided into three main arenas.\n\nThe first is the traditional heartland of geopolitics: Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe second is East Asia, which is the subject of the next report in this series.\n\nThe third is the Americas.\n\nWhat do these three regions have in common? Each is a geographic region that has historically been the center of great power politics. In each, a single dominant power has emerged. The Middle East, for instance, has been dominated by the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. And both regions are being reshaped by the rise of new powers: China in East Asia, and the United States in the Middle East. Finally, in all three regions the nature of the state itself is under challenge, along with the primacy of geopolitics itself. The current global crisis has brought into question whether the prevailing order can survive in the 21st century.\n\nThis report begins with Europe and the Middle East because these regions are the oldest and most historically influential. We will also discuss the second geopolitical zone, East Asia. East Asia is growing in importance but is also the subject of the next report.\n\nThe report concludes with a discussion of the Americas. The United States is dominant in this region, but its primacy is being challenged by a more ambitious and powerful China. This rise has important implications for the geopolitics of the region.<|endoftext|>(Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty Images)\n\nWith the NFL Draft inching ever closer, the Redskins rumor mill is starting to spin up.\n\nToday, Albert Breer of NFL.com gave his two cents on Washington's chances of trading up in this year's draft:\n\nI don't think they're going to trade up. I think they're gonna try to get more picks. Now, I think that's where they're gonna go. That said, there is a part of me that looks at them and says: I think they need a running back. I think there's a part of them that thinks: We'll see how the board falls. I could be totally wrong. But I feel like there's a decent chance, I guess, that they go up.\n\nWhether Washington goes up or down in the first round is only part of the equation, because they need to come away with a running back to finally replace Alfred Morris.\n\nLast season, Morris was Washington's leading rusher with just 751 yards. This offseason, the Redskins did not re-sign Roy Helu and traded away their other veteran back in Silas Redd. Washington has Matt Jones and Chris Thompson, but both have dealt with injuries.\n\nWhat's next for the Washington Redskins? Make sure you're in the loop — Take five seconds to sign up for our FREE Redskins Newsletter NOW!\n\nIt would make sense for the Redskins to grab a running back in this year's draft, especially if they do trade back a few spots and pick up an extra pick. The Redskins are going to have a lot of picks this year, with nine of them in the draft. They also have a lot of holes on their roster, especially on defense.\n\nWashington is expected to target defense in this year's draft, with most of the talk revolving around a top cornerback. The Redskins also need help at linebacker and in the secondary, so trading back and drafting a running back wouldn't be a bad"

That’s exactly what happened to Kentucky’s basketball program this past Saturday as the Wildcats were upset by the Arkansas Razorbacks, 78-72, in the SEC Tournament championship game. After winning the Big 12 Tournament and the SEC Tournament the Wildcats had a firm grip on the overall No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and a spot in the Final Four was almost guaranteed.\n\nWith all of the talk about how Kentucky would make a run for a perfect season, one very important fact was left out of the conversation. That is, the Kentucky Wildcats have been a very average defensive team all year.\n\nIn fact, they have ranked outside of the top-25 in defensive efficiency in each of the last three seasons. Their defensive efficiency this season ranks 47th in the country, an improvement from the previous two seasons but certainly not good enough to go far in the NCAA Tournament. If their defense is not improved in the NCAA Tournament, they could easily be upset again and sent home earlier than most had expected.\n\nNot only was the lack of defense frustrating to watch, but it also exposed the flaws in this team. Just as their defensive ability is being overlooked, the flaws in the offense are also being glossed over.\n\nDespite being led by freshman center Willie Cauley-Stein, the Wildcats do not have a rim-protector. They were fourth in the SEC in blocks and their opponents averaged more attempts at the rim than their opponents. Their big men had trouble defending inside and that allowed teams to force their guards into situations where they needed to score against a tough defense.\n\nDespite having a solid starting five, the reserves did not contribute. Most of the minutes off the bench were played by the inexperienced Ryan Harrow and Jarrod Polson. These two have a combined total of 35 games played between them.\n\nDespite what the team lacks, they still have many reasons to be optimistic about the upcoming NCAA Tournament. Their offense has been very good and that has carried them throughout the season. They have the talent to win games against any team and have proved that by defeating multiple top-10 opponents this season.\n\nThe most glaring weakness on this team is the lack of defense. If they can find a way to fix that, this team has the potential to make a deep run into the NCAA Tournament. If they can not, then there are bound to be a few more losses along the way and an early end to the season for the Kentucky Wildcats.<|endoftext|>LOWELL — Police have arrested a Lowell woman on charges she left her 10-year-old daughter unattended in a vehicle at an Old Country Buffet restaurant, then left the girl in the restaurant and drove away.\n\nNahilie Estela, 36, of Lowell, was arrested on two counts of reckless endangerment of a child. She is scheduled to be arraigned in Lowell District Court on Oct. 2.\n\nA police report said a restaurant employee, who was on her break, noticed a small child sitting in the car and called police.

She had a big personality, a keen sense of humor, and a voice that could give a mountain a sore throat. She also gave off a vibe that made me want to jump into her car, and I would have, had she offered.\n\nThe story I'd heard about her was that she had tried to commit suicide by lighting herself on fire. When a police officer approached her and said, \"Put the lighter down, honey,\" she allegedly replied, \"Fuck you, motherfucker, don't call me honey.\"\n\nI was fascinated by her. Not because of her attempted suicide, which I am empathetic toward, but because she was so many different things, and I wasn't sure if she was real.\n\nSo I invited her to the party I was attending, and when she said she couldn't make it, I asked her if she wanted to go to dinner and a movie instead. She said yes, and we hung out a few more times, but it never really went anywhere.\n\nI think the girl at the gas station was the only woman I really didn't like at the time. The reason I had a hard time being her friend was because I couldn't be her friend. I had to be her boyfriend, or she would want to be my girlfriend, and I was still hung up on the girl from school.\n\nWhen you are a teenager, you think everyone you meet has a secret agenda.\n\nYou don't realize you are a person, you are a type. And the type is the kind of person you are looking for. When someone crosses that line, they stop being a person and they become a situation.\n\nFor the next three years, I was in that situation.\n\nI liked this girl, this type of girl, because she didn't know how to not be attracted to me.\n\nI liked her because I knew I had power over her.\n\nI liked her because she was vulnerable.\n\nI liked her because she was scared.\n\nI liked"

"Now, with all of the cool, exciting things we can do with the processing power of the computer, let’s put this old-time calculator to use.\n\nThis one is really cool.\n\n3. Two-dimensional input or output\n\nAs a programmer, I was fascinated with the idea that we could actually create a program that would help us multiply numbers without any effort on our part! This was the point that my mom started to really believe in the benefits of a computer.\n\nBack then, our computer was a Windows XP machine, and it didn’t have any fancy graphics. But if you’re not too hung up on having 3-D graphics and lots of buttons, you can get the same effect with a simple “multiplication table.”\n\nInstead of using a computer to do the hard work of multiplying, you can make use of a simple list. First, let’s think about the basics of what we need to accomplish.\n\nHere’s a screenshot of our multiplication table program:\n\nIn the screenshot above, I created a list that looks like this:\n\n[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] [200] [201] [202] [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] [222] [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] [263] [264] [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] [270] [271] [272] [273] [274] [275] [276] [277] [278] [279] [280] [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] [286] [287] [288] [289] [290] [291] [292] [293] [294] [295] [296] [297] [298] [299] [300] [301] [302] [303] [304] [305] [306] [307] [308] [309] [310] [311] [312] [313] [314] [315] [316] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321] [322] [323] [324] [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] [330] [331] [332] [333] [334] [335] [336] [337] [338] [339] [340] [341] [342] [343] [344] [345] [346] [347] [348] [349] [350] [351] [352] [353] [354] [355] [356] [357] [358] [359] [360] [361] [362] [363] [364] [365] [366] [367] [368] [369] [370] [371] [372] [373] [374] [375] [376] [377] [378] [379] [380] [381] [382] [383] [384] [385] [386] [387] [388] [389] [390] [391] [392] [393] [394] [395] [396] [397] [398] [399] [400] [401] [402] [403] [404] [405] [406] [407] [408] [409] [410] [411] [412] [413] [414] [415] [416] [417] [418] [419] [420] [421] [422] [423] [424] [425] [426] [427] [428] [429] [430] [431] [432] [433] [434] [435] [436] [437] [438] [439] [440] [441] [442] [443] [444] [445] [446] [447] [448] [449] [450] [451] [452] [453] [454] [455] [456] [457] [458] [459] [460] [461] [462] [463] [464] [465] [466] [467] [468] [469] [470] [471] [472] [473] [474] [475] [476] [477] [478] [479] [480] [481] [482] [483] [484] [485] [486] [487] [488] [489] [490] [491] [492] [493] [494] [495] [496] [497] [498] [499] [500] [501] [502] [503] [504] [505] [506] [507] [508] [509] [510] [511] [512] [513] [514] [515] [516] [517] [518] [519] [520] [521] [522] [523] [524] [525] [526] [527] [528] [529] [530] [531] [532] [533] [534] [535] [536] [537] [538] [539] [540] [541] [542] [543] [544] [545] [546] [547] [548] [549] [550] [551] [552] [553] [554] [555] [556] [557] [558] [559] [560] [561] [562] [563] [564] [565] [566] [567] [568] [569] [570] [571] [572] [573] [574] [575] [576] [577] [578] [579] [580] [581] [582] [583] [584] [585] [586] [587] [588] [589] [590] [591] [592] [593] [594] [595] [596] [597] [598] [599]"

Now it’s valued at $400K. - Stephanie Yao Long/Marketplace\n\nListen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2012/09/24/economy/troubled-times-investing-down-market/popout\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"240px\"></iframe>\n\nStephanie Yao Long: There are many stories to tell about the housing market in this region.\n\nHome values are down, the economy is still recovering. One story is of an 18-year-old couple who bought their first house. One morning, 18-year-old Christin and her husband Matthew woke up, and a sheriff was at the front door. They had fallen behind on their mortgage payments. The bank foreclosed on their home.\n\nI asked Christin what that day was like.\n\nChristin: You don't know how to react to it. It's just one of those things that happened. I guess it's all how you deal with it after that, I guess.\n\nBut in the end, Christin and Matthew were able to stay in the home -- even though they fell behind on payments, even though the lender foreclosed. In this instance, a government agency bought the home and made the couple a lower-interest mortgage. They didn't have to pay the difference in what they owed and what the house was worth.\n\nI asked Christin how she felt about this.\n\nChristin: It was wonderful. It was nice to get the home back.\n\nStephanie Yao Long, Marketplace.<|endoftext|>\n\nFor the first time in history a solar sail powered by fusion reactions, not solar radiation pressure, is successfully deployed. It is described as a first step toward a solar sail powered by fusion fuel.\n\nResearch has also been conducted on solar sails. However, the new design is intended to be practical in the near future, as it is expected to be able to reach speeds of up to 70,000 mph (11 km/s).\n\nResearch led by the Polytechnic Institute of Milan developed the solar sail, with funding from the Italian Space Agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, or ASI). This new solar sail was launched on July 11, 2013. The testing is being conducted by the picosatellite, called “PicSat”, which was designed and built at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan. PicSat’s development was made possible thanks to a Ph.D. scholarship from the CNR-PRIN research project.\n\nThe picosatellite, PicSat, weighs around 1 kilogram and is about the size of a shoebox. The complete project cost about 100,000 Euro. It includes a solar sail to generate propulsion force as well as a scientific payload consisting of an on-board X-ray detector.\n\nThe solar sail, or “solar-radiation-pressure sail”, was successfully deployed during a 6 hour experiment on July 18th, 2013. The deployment took place during a deep-space simulation experiment on board the Ariane 5 rocket’s Fregat upper stage. Fregat is a three-stage solid-fueled orbital launch vehicle, with strap-on solid rocket boosters.\n\nThe solar sail consists of a multi-layer structure with a combined weight of about 1 kg. The structure is made of layers of polyimide, carbon, and quartz. The solar sail is about 3 square meters.\n\nThe sail is tethered to the picosatellite via a 2-meter tether. The picosatellite has onboard attitude control devices such as reaction wheels.\n\nThe objective of the experiment is to demonstrate that the solar sail is functional in space. It is a proof of concept. The experiment was successful, and it confirmed that the deployment of the sail was possible, and the sail was properly deployed. In particular, the sail was not damaged by the forces associated with the deployment, and the picosatellite remained functional.\n\nIt is expected that the picosatellite will continue its orbital mission for at least 6 more months. The onboard X-ray detector has the objective of measuring the dynamics of the solar wind in the earth’s vicinity, in particular, and investigate the “polar wind”.\n\nImage: PICOSAT: INAF-OAR’s new picosatellite was developed at the OAR (Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali) of the INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica). PicSat will be operated by INAF-OAR. The project was launched by an Italian research council and funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) under contract with the Polytechnic of Milan. PicSat carries a payload in the form of an X-ray detector developed at the INAF-IASF Bologna, under the supervision of the INAF-OAR.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nGoogle\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTumblr\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments<|endoftext|>June 7, 2019 Journal article Open Access\n\nHow efficient is ethanol production from sugar cane and how can we achieve better results?\n\nNieva Ros; Buenemann Sebastian; Torres-Herrera Ramiro\n\nJSON Export\n\n{ \"files\": [ { \"links\": { \"self\": \"https://zenodo.org/api/files/a71f60ca-ddad-4ca9-bf44-4ecda52c4cd4/72005738.pdf\" }, \"checksum\": \"md5:ec50ec40bbd20c7bb819f8ddb30f2043\", \"bucket\": \"a71f60ca-ddad-4ca9-bf44-4ecda52c4cd4\", \"key\": \"72005738.pdf\", \"type\": \"pdf\", \"size\": 432274 }, { \"links\": { \"self\": \"https://zenodo.org/api/files/a71f60ca-ddad-4ca9-bf44-4ecda52c4cd4/CICATTA+ORCHID+v1.2.1+21.06.2018.zip\" }, \"checksum\": \"md5:a091ca6a80ddcc1eb62f5639af28d062\", \"bucket\": \"a71f60ca-ddad-4ca9-bf44-4ecda52c4cd4\", \"key\": \"CICATTA+ORCHID+v1.2.1+21.06.2018.zip\", \"type\": \"zip\", \"size\": 4936956 } ], \"owners\": [ 13330 ], \"doi\": \"10.5281/zenodo.2497619\", \"stats\": { \"version_unique_downloads\": 21.0, \"unique_views\": 23.0, \"views\": 24.0, \"downloads\": 25.0, \"unique_downloads\": 21.0, \"version_unique_views\": 23.0, \"volume\": 13121493.0, \"version_downloads\": 25.0, \"version_views\": 24.0, \"version_volume\": 13121493.0 }, \"links\": { \"doi\": \"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2497619\", \"latest_html\": \"https://zenodo.org/record/2497619\", \"bucket\": \"https://zenodo.org/api/files/a71f60ca-ddad-4ca9-bf44-4ecda52c4cd4\", \"badge\": \"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2497619.svg\", \"html\": \"https://zenodo.org/record/2497619\", \"latest\": \"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2497619\" }, \"created\": \"2019-06-11T07:00:04.370665+00:00\", \"updated\": \"2019-06-11T07:00:04.370665+00:00\", \"conceptrecid\": \"897194\", \"revision\": 5, \"id\": 2497619, \"metadata\": { \"access_right_category\": \"success\", \"doi\": \"10.5281/zenodo.2497619\", \"description\": \"<p>Within the context of current concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy prices, biofuels are an attractive alternative to conventional fuels in the transport sector.

Photo: Getty Images \"I think there is a degree of that [tribalism] there, but at the end of the day we're representing our country,\" Mumm said. \"There's obviously that type of animosity [between NSW and Queensland] that is probably more of a NSW-based thing and it is what it is. There's nothing really that we can do about that. We've got to play for our country and represent our country. \"Everyone is out there putting their bodies on the line and doing the best they can for their team and I think at the end of the day you're either in the gold jersey or you're in the maroon. It's going to be interesting.\" The hard men of the recent series – Reds prop James Slipper and Rebels hooker James Hanson – will both be in action. A pack featuring Kane Douglas and Kane Barret, who were at each other's throats a fortnight ago in the Brumbies-Rebels match, also takes the field.\n\nA tussle: Nick Phipps of the Rebels and Dan Palmer of the Waratahs. Photo: Getty Images Both teams are missing several top players. Queensland have lost six Wallabies in the build-up to the match and the Rebels will be without six internationals. With coach Rob Moore using their depth of young talent and resting Wallabies skipper James Horwill and fly half James O'Connor, the Rebels might be a little overwhelmed. When the teams were named on Thursday, Rebels coach Damien Hill declared his side would \"go out and express ourselves in our normal way\" against a team they consider their bogey team. Rebels five-eighth Kurtley Beale will play his first match since suffering a fractured eye socket against the Blues in July. He said the Waratahs had been the \"perfect\" preparation for a tough match.\n\n\"Especially the last couple of weeks,\" Beale said. \"Obviously there's a bit of a rivalry going on. It's going to be a tough game. We've been focusing on ourselves the whole year, building that sort of self-belief and just worry about the way we want to play. \"We're a good team in that sense. Obviously if we get that part of the game right, we can put on a performance.\" Beale said he did not know if his eye would be an issue but he was looking forward to testing it in a game. If he did find it tough, he would ask coach Hill to take him off. He said he had not taken the precaution of having a special protective visor made.\n\n\"I think I've got a couple of old ones but they're pretty heavy,\" he said. \"I can't see through them as well. I might have a look at that.\" The match will be a sell-out. At AAMI Stadium on Friday night, Hill expects to name an unchanged starting line-up, with young fly half Jack Debreczeni to earn his first start of the year. Debreczeni played half a game in the Shute Shield earlier this year but this will be his first Super Rugby start. The 20-year-old, who is from Adelaide, is one of four players who will make their starting debut, along with fullback Reece Hodge, loose forward Dan Palmer and prop Toby Smith. Hill said that because of the four debutants, there would be \"a fair bit of nervous energy\" but he had been pleased by the calmness of the squad and the quality of training. He said the Rebels' depth was starting to show and there was a good mix of youth and experience in the team.<|endoftext|>On its surface, Joseph Mallozzi's Dark Matter is a story about the crew of the spaceship Raza, who are awakened from stasis with no memories of who they are or how they got on board. But at its core, it's a story about people with real emotions and real experiences. A series of Dark Matter shorts focusing on one or two of the main cast members premieres today on Syfy. Mallozzi spoke with SYFY WIRE about why he loves these vignettes and what to expect in season three.\n\nWhat's your overall approach to the characters on this show? What's your thinking behind the way the actors are playing them?\n\nThe biggest thing was that we had six one-hour episodes to introduce the characters. And then a 13-episode order of the first season that gave us time to delve into the character's histories and their backstories. So by the time we got into season two, we were well into our stride in terms of the character dynamics.\n\nThat said, one of the key things about the show is that it is a character-driven drama first and foremost. These are very relatable people that we all interact with in our daily lives. The premise of the show is fantastical in nature, but it's the characters who bring it all home. The stories have to be compelling and the characters have to be interesting, otherwise it doesn't really matter what the premise is.\n\nWhy are you so interested in vignettes about the characters?\n\nI've always been a huge fan of storytelling within the storytelling. It goes all the way back to my time on Stargate. One of the best things we did there was in the episode \"Window of Opportunity,\" in which we flash back to Jonas's past, and we see his wife and children as part of a mining colony that's been attacked by the Goa'uld. And then we flash forward to his present and what's left of the Goa'uld is taking him out to be executed. And we've established his backstory and how it led to this moment.\n\nIt was a perfect blend of flashback storytelling with the present day. It worked beautifully. And then there was another episode, \"Meridian,\" in which we get a flashback from Daniel Jackson's perspective of how he became a Stargate team member. It gave us a real insight into who Daniel Jackson was, as a person, and how he came to be involved with the Stargate program. And it was beautifully written by [Joseph Mallozzi].\n\nWhat's the storytelling advantage of these character-focused moments?\n\nThat's a great question. There are so many things that you can explore in a character-focused moment. For instance, in season one of Dark Matter, Episode 207 is called \"All the Time in the World.\" It's a story about Two's past, and her being a bit of a criminal, and stealing things for a living. And how her and Ryo Ishida, whom we saw in episode two, were involved in the death of a third party who happens to be their boss. And how it led to them ending up on the Raza in the first place.\n\nWe got to see Two as a character, and the motivations behind her actions. There's the potential for growth in that moment, because we realize that she was forced into this life by someone who held her as a captive. And she has an opportunity, when she returns to the past and saves her boss' life, to change her past and potentially change the events that brought her and Ryo to the Raza. And in so doing, she is able to help herself get a second chance.\n\nWhat are some of the advantages of a vignette over a more direct flashback?\n\nI guess the best way to explain this is with an example. In season two of Dark Matter, we were doing this episode called \"Welcome To the Revolution,\" which introduced us to Devon and his girlfriend Nyx, and their backstory. We were at the point in the story where we needed to introduce these characters and we had a lot of story to tell. So instead of doing a traditional flashback in which we would focus on one or the other, we chose to introduce them both in a flashback that combined their stories.\n\nIt gave us an opportunity to show two characters interacting with each other. And also to have them talk about each other and their histories. In terms of storytelling, it's more efficient. You get to tell a lot more story with just one character.\n\nIs it harder or easier to write a vignette than it is to write a regular episode?\n\nIf it's all about the action, then it's easier. But then the challenge is figuring out how to balance it all. Because, you don't want the vignette to be all about talking heads. You want to have some interesting visuals in there, some interesting production design, some interesting set pieces. So in that regard, it's a bit of a challenge. But the fact that we have this fantastic team of directors and VFX artists helps make that process easier.\n\nIs there a particular vignette you're particularly proud of?\n\nThis is one of my favorite episodes. In season one, Episode 210 is called \"We Were Family,\" and it's about Five and Six. It was something that we had planned from day one. And then the second season came along and we were coming off the"
"\n\nRevocation of work permits and licenses for foreigners who are found guilty of drug trafficking\n\n<excerpt>\n\nTashkent, 24 April. UZBEKISTAN.RU – At a meeting of the Government, the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced a new initiative of the Government, approved by the president of the country Islam Karimov, the “suspension” of work permits and licenses for foreigners who are found guilty of drug trafficking.\n\nThe Cabinet introduced a package of bills to amend the Administrative Offenses Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Law on the Fight Against Narcotic Drugs. These documents envisage the possibility of suspending work permits and licenses for foreigners found guilty of drug trafficking, as well as the revocation of such permits and licenses.\n\nThis provision applies to individuals who, after a final conviction for drug trafficking, work on a freelance basis, providing services to a foreign firm, or who work in another country and hold a work permit for Uzbekistan.\n\nShavkat Mirziyoyev noted that the government intends to introduce amendments to other laws of the country to ensure that individuals, who are subject to administrative penalties for drug trafficking, are expelled from the country for at least five years.\n\n“Foreigners who have committed the crime of drug trafficking, must be permanently denied entry to our country. This measure is designed to create additional leverage in the fight against drug trafficking,” Mirziyoyev said.\n\nAccording to the prime minister, foreigners found guilty of drug trafficking can be denied entry to Uzbekistan for a term of at least five years.\n\nIn addition, he noted that a “complete purge” of drug trafficking will help to ensure that the government can attract foreign investments. “Our desire to attract foreign investments is very strong. As long as it is impossible to do without foreign labor. Therefore, it is very important that those who want to work here, should not do so with the aim of carrying out criminal activity. Therefore, such decisions are extremely important for us. The fact that we are able to raise this question, I believe, is a positive result. The president is aware of this, we discussed this question with the president, he said that we must not lag behind other countries in the fight against narcotics. The president of our country also pointed to the fact that we have already done a lot to fight against drug trafficking. And this is the most important thing,” Mirziyoyev said.\n\nRecall, the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan “On the Fight Against Narcotic Drugs”, signed by the President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov on March 24, 1995, came into force on May 7 of the same year. This law established and expanded the penalties for the legalization of drug-trafficking funds.<|endoftext|>The Saint of Lost Things, Laura McHugh\n\nNot even the blurb for The Saint of Lost Things could make me excited to read it. I hate the tone, the narrator’s tone, I hate the whiny, childish quality of it. It’s weirdly a tone I feel is becoming common in YA, although it’s more often a tone than overt. This book, however, has it in spades, and while it is part of the personality of the narrator, there was just too much of it for me to ignore. And it put me off the book. A lot.\n\nSo, a young girl comes to the “Big City” to find her estranged father. It’s not a good situation, she’s forced to beg for money on the street and sleep in a laundromat, but when she hears of an organization that collects lost things for its patrons, she goes to the premises of the Society of Lost Things and becomes a member. The Society of Lost Things is essentially a hotel for lost things, it houses objects that have been misplaced or lost, and its employees, called “guardians,” are people who have lost something in their lives. The lost things come to the Society of Lost Things because there is someone out there looking for them, and they want to be found.\n\nThere is so much more to this story than this, but it seems like a jumbled mess to try to write about. And I don’t think I would do it justice. The premise is lovely, and I loved the parts with some magic, but there was too much about this story that felt unfinished and inconclusive, and it never felt like a cohesive whole. It wasn’t that I didn’t like it, but I think that I would have liked it more if I had been less invested in the characters and their stories.\n\nReading this, I kept thinking of these two different books, and I’m going to review them both.\n\nWhen We Collided, Emery Lord\n\nWhen We Collided has a very similar feel to The Saint of Lost Things. Both are set in the “Big City” in New York City. Both have teenagers dealing with difficult family situations. Both have teenagers who are left alone and vulnerable. But the similarities don’t end there, there are two protagonists in each novel, and both of them are lost. It’s hard to tell where their story ends and the other one’s begins. But these similarities don’t end there. Each of the protagonists have lost people, in different ways, but they’re both trying to find themselves and figure out who they are. But their similarities are not what made me think of this book.\n\nWhen We Collided is about Tessa, a young girl who is on the verge of her senior year in high school, and Leo, a boy who lives with his dad and has a bit of a drug problem. Tessa has a relationship with a much older guy, and he comes into her life again in the most unexpected way. She decides that she needs to get away from her home situation, which is getting more and more dire, and so she flees to California. Her arrival in California happens almost in the same way as her arrival in the “Big City” in The Saint of Lost Things. She lives on the street and survives by selling her jewelry. Then she meets Leo.\n\nSo, When We Collided and The Saint of Lost Things have so much in common, and yet I loved one and was just fine with the other. They have very different feel, and I think it’s because they have very different characters. I think that the characters in When We Collided were the main reason that I loved it so much. Leo and Tessa are so different, and I loved both of them. Leo has some pretty serious drug issues, but he’s very open and honest about it, and I really liked that. He has some very honest conversations with Tessa, and they’re awkward and heartfelt and really beautifully written. But Leo also has this quirkiness about him, this innocence that I think is so refreshing. Leo, even though he does have some pretty serious drug issues, has not had a lot of life experience, and I think he has a kind of innocence about him. But he’s also really loyal and honest, and that’s what makes him so endearing. Tessa, on the other hand, is very passionate and loyal and honest and fierce and brave, but she’s also very headstrong and self-doubting, which makes for a very intriguing character.\n\nI loved the intermingling of Tessa’s story with Leo’s, I loved that the story wasn’t just one that followed Tessa, but that Leo was really there to help Tessa along the way. It was a very interesting read, I was sucked in almost instantly and stayed there until the end.\n\nHave you read either of these books? If you have, what did you think of them? Do you have any suggestions of books that are similar to them? I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>Réponse de Marie et Eric :\n\nThe location of the house is really quiet and peaceful.

This is not to say that their shared class status does not matter—but one can’t help wondering why Max’s liberal upbringing should be of less relevance to her education and thinking than her race and gender. When she finds herself pregnant, she goes to her parents for support and finds only disapproval. Her decision to marry Bigger is met with bewilderment, but she dismisses any further thoughts about her situation until her husband is accused of murder. She decides to leave Chicago and go home to Mississippi, where she’ll have the support of her parents, who know she’s pregnant and are willing to pay for her to keep the baby. But when she arrives in Monroe, she is shocked to find her mother cold and disapproving and her father distant. In time, she goes to work as a teacher at a small black school, where she finds her first real sense of community. She doesn’t see Bigger again for many years, and when she does, she is pleased to discover that he has become a successful businessman. Their meeting is bittersweet, and Max, whose daughter is now a young woman, decides to live her life on her own terms. The author clearly knows how to tell a story, and she’s taken a powerful idea and created a great deal of drama around it. But the characters are so relentlessly stereotyped that the novel is ultimately less convincing as social commentary than it might have been. The narrative moves between past and present, with little internal consistency. But what this does do is make the book hard to read, as the present-day characters, who feel unrealistically unconnected to the narrative context, dominate.\n\nAn intriguing and thought-provoking book, though not an entirely satisfying one.<|endoftext|>A New York Times report on Trump’s latest financial statements show his golf properties lost money — and an overall plunge in value\n\nDonald Trump’s status as a real estate mogul has never been something he’s been shy about. Whether it’s on Twitter or in interviews, he often talks about how his companies are doing well, and it’s not just all talk: Forbes estimates his net worth at $3.1 billion, and he’s in the top 0.1 percent of wealth holders.\n\nStill, Trump’s grip on that “real estate mogul” mantle is in danger, thanks to a New York Times report that his golf courses have lost money, and that his overall wealth may be dropping.\n\nThe Times report uses Trump’s most recent financial statement to show that the valuation of his assets, including his golf courses, has decreased by more than $200 million. What’s more, his income from his businesses appears to have declined by almost half. While Trump may have been busy being president of the United States, he was also making decisions about his business, and those decisions may be impacting his personal wealth.\n\nWhat’s in the Times report?\n\nThe report comes from David Barstow, Susanne Craig, and Russ Buettner, who looked at Trump’s most recent financial disclosure form and compared it with the previous two years of his finances. As the Washington Post’s Christopher Ingraham pointed out, Trump’s 2016 form was the first time he revealed a massive loss of $916 million in the value of his stocks.\n\nThe Times report shows that this is not the only financial blow to the Trump business empire: the company’s golf courses in the United States appear to be in trouble. The Times found that each of the president’s golf courses had lost money in the past year. They may be doing a bit better now, the report says, but the revenues remain lower than Trump’s golf courses in the United States did in 2015. And according to the report, the Trump Organization is looking to move some of its golf properties in the United States to new management.\n\nOne of Trump’s properties, Trump Turnberry, reportedly had trouble attracting golfers during the time he was campaigning for president, the Times reported. The property was open only sporadically during 2016 and early 2017.\n\nThe impact on Trump’s net worth\n\nThe Times report looks at Trump’s entire business, not just his golf courses. And according to the report, the value of his assets has declined by $400 million since the last time he filed his financial disclosure form.\n\nHow does this affect his net worth? The same report points out that Forbes has repeatedly lowered its estimate of Trump’s net worth, and that their current estimate is $3.1 billion. The figure is below the $4 billion that Forbes estimated Trump’s net worth to be in 2015.\n\nThe $400 million in losses, along with Trump’s $916 million loss on the stock market and his $50 million in earnings in 2016, mean his net worth has gone down by more than $1 billion since 2016.\n\nAll of this, the report points out, leaves Trump as the richest president in US history — for now.<|endoftext|>Easily build powerful user management, authentication, and authorization into your web and mobile applications. Download this Forrester report on the new landscape of Customer Identity and Access Management, brought to you in partnership with Stormpath .\n\nSome of you may know the Flyway by now. It’s a simple but powerful database migration tool that allows developers to work with a database in a more agile way. So we wanted to start working with Flyway in our projects too. We’ve developed a Flyway Maven plugin to make it easier to work with Flyway in a Maven project. It allows you to execute the Flyway scripts from the build, test or packaging phases of the Maven build lifecycle. So you can execute your database migration scripts automatically during the build.\n\nIf you’ve already used Flyway in your project, you know that there are a couple of ways to integrate Flyway into your project. There are three ways to use Flyway with Maven. The most common way is to use a simple .sql script. You can execute that script with a separate Maven command, but that doesn’t work very well for incremental builds. Another option is to call a Java method to execute your migration scripts. This also works quite well, but can become difficult when you want to write custom scripts. In our case, we want to build an Android app which means we can’t use Java. Instead, we need to use some sort of build script to execute our migrations. This is where Flyway comes in.\n\nFlyway is a very simple tool and is easy to use. It just requires a couple of extra steps to make it work properly with Maven. The first step is to execute the migration script from a build script. This is done by calling the FlywayRunner. There are a couple of different ways to use it. You can just pass in a path to the script and execute it, or pass in the Flyway Configuration and run it with the specific options. So you could either execute all your migration scripts from one build step or use a different build step for each migration script. The second step is to integrate the Maven build into the process. We do this by adding an extra plugin to our build.\n\nLet’s have a look at how to use Flyway in a Maven project. We’ll start by creating a simple Maven project. We won’t include any source code in this example. Instead, we’ll just use an existing database. We’ll use a simple H2 database which can be downloaded for free from http://h2database.com. Download and extract the zip file and you should see the following directory structure.\n\nNow let’s add our database to our Maven project. This is done by adding a new Maven artifact to our pom.xml. So add a new maven-dependency to our pom.xml.\n\n<dependency> <groupId>com.h2database</groupId> <artifactId>h2</artifactId> <version>1.4.187</version> </dependency>\n\nThis will pull the h2 database into our project and put it into the test-jar/lib directory. So now we have a database to use in our migration scripts.\n\nNext, we’ll add the Flyway Maven plugin to our pom.xml.\n\n<build> <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId> <artifactId>flyway-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>2.1.0.RC2</version> </plugin> </plugins> </build>\n\nNow that we’ve added the plugin, we’ll need to add a couple of extra dependencies. First we’ll add the extra Flyway dependencies. These are required to run the Flyway Maven plugin."
"India, home to the largest population of non-religious people in the world, has witnessed a sharp decline in religious diversity over the past century, a study has found. The study released on Tuesday by the US-based think-tank Pew Research Centre found that \"the share of the non-religious in India's population is slated to rise to nearly 30% by 2050\".\n\nThe report analysed demographic data and survey responses of nearly 1,000 people across 13 states and union territories in India, and concluded that almost 30% of Indians do not practice or identify with any religion.\n\nThe share of Hindus, the largest religious community in India, is expected to drop from 81.3% of the population in 2015 to 78.5% in 2050, the report said. It found that religious minorities — which include Muslims, Christians and Sikhs — will make up a greater share of India's population in the coming decades.\n\nIndia has the third-largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia and Pakistan, but has a relatively low population of Christians.\n\nNon-religious people make up the largest share of India's population (28.7%), followed by Muslims (18.4%), Hindus (81.3%), Christians (2.3%) and Sikhs (1.7%).\n\nIn terms of percentage share of population, India is currently behind only three other countries — China, the Czech Republic and Japan — where non-religious people are the majority.\n\nHowever, India is expected to surpass the Czech Republic and China by 2050 to emerge as the country with the highest number of non-religious people in the world, the study said.\n\nAt 30%, India would have nearly as many non-religious people as the rest of the world put together (31%).\n\nGlobally, the proportion of non-religious people is expected to rise from 13% of the population to 16% over the next 35 years.\n\nThe researchers analysed census and survey data from 16 states and union territories where non-religious people are the second-largest religious group.\n\nThese states include Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe report is based on the assumption that fertility rates and religious conversion patterns will stay the same as they have been since 1991.\n\nFirst Published: Mar 06, 2018 14:42 IST<|endoftext|>The brains of infants are more flexible than those of adults. They can learn and absorb information like sponges.\n\nAt one time, that's what scientists thought. Then brain researchers discovered that the adult brain is in fact plastic, too, as long as you're willing to get out of your comfort zone. It turns out the difference between infant and adult brains has to do with what they're doing, and not what they're made of.\n\nA big reason for the differences between adult and infant brains is that adults tend to specialize. Once we've become an expert at something, we have a hard time doing anything else. We don't want to be flexible.\n\nThink of a professional pianist who's no longer able to appreciate music. The same is true of all kinds of things, including reading.\n\n\"Once you have learned to read, it can be harder to learn to write, and it can be harder to learn to speak a foreign language, because you have this other thing you're used to doing,\" says Maryanne Wolf, a neuroscientist and literacy researcher at Tufts University.\n\nAnother problem is that the adult brain is not very good at forming new brain cells. In fact, the adult brain loses about 10,000 brain cells a day.\n\nWhen it comes to losing brain cells, it turns out infants are the big losers. A baby is born with about 100 billion brain cells, which is far more than any other animal on the planet. Then the brain starts pruning. Infants lose about one billion brain cells a day, and the rate of cell loss keeps increasing throughout childhood and adolescence.\n\nMost neuroscientists believe that it's better to have too many brain cells than too few, because the brain can't do anything until it develops all its basic components.\n\n\"Children actually are growing their brain cells at the same time they're pruning away other connections, which is not at all understood and which is fascinating,\" Wolf says.\n\nWhy do kids need to be able to prune away connections? Because the brain's wiring system is not finished until a child reaches about 12 years of age. So much is happening, Wolf says, that \"all of that synapse-making is both a blessing and a curse.\"\n\nSynapses are the connections between brain cells, the hardware of the brain. Think of them as your cell phone's apps. You want lots of apps, because they make your phone versatile. But at the same time, too many apps slow down your phone.\n\nNeuroscientists have discovered that the key to learning is not making more synapses, it's strengthening the ones you already have. That means finding the best connections, and then getting rid of the ones that are not working.\n\nThis process of strengthening and weakening connections is what neuroscientists call synaptic plasticity. We see it every day in the way babies learn to crawl and walk. At first, they're very unsteady on their feet. As they learn, they adjust their walking to avoid obstacles. Eventually, they get better and better at walking. Then, if they don't use it, they lose it. They become more specialized at walking, and less flexible.\n\nSo the difference between adult and infant brains is not that babies have more synapses. It's that their synapses are less specialized. They're not attached to just one skill or task. They're flexible.<|endoftext|>Ted S. Warren/Associated Press\n\nFor the Seattle Seahawks, the 2018 NFL draft was all about defense. The organization used seven of its eight picks on that side of the ball, and two of those selections—defensive lineman Rasheem Green (No. 79 overall) and cornerback Tre Flowers (No. 180 overall)—were fourth-rounders.\n\nWith each of those players, the team now boasts a higher grade on the depth chart than it did before the draft, but as to how the team grades out as a whole, it’s unclear. We won’t have an answer to that question for at least a year.\n\nHere’s a look at the Seahawks’ draft class and how each of the players might fit into the team’s future.\n\nRasheem Green, DE, USC\n\nGreen was a highly productive player at USC. In three years with the Trojans, he totaled 45.5 tackles for loss and 20 sacks. According to Pro Football Focus, he ranked in the top 20 of 4-3 defensive ends in the nation in 2017 with a grade of 83.6.\n\nThe Seahawks are stacked on the defensive line, and at the time of his selection, Green was slotted as a fourth- or fifth-round talent. The fact that the Seahawks traded up to select him, and that he was the second defensive lineman taken in this draft, means that the team was likely really high on him and expects him to contribute as a rookie.\n\nThe Seahawks are deep on the defensive line, though, and while Green was one of the most productive defensive ends in the nation, his value on the team is unclear. Expect him to compete for a spot on the 53-man roster, but for him to be active on game day as a rookie would be a surprise.\n\nRashaad Penny, RB, San Diego State\n\nAs a player, Penny has been discussed at length. He’s going to have a chance to compete for the starting running back spot, and while he’s not an exceptional athlete, his college tape shows a player with all of the traits to be a solid runner in the NFL.\n\nThe Seahawks have been a power running team for a while, and they’ve had a lot of success in that scheme. Adding a runner like Penny could be the final piece of the puzzle.\n\nThe Seahawks had a couple of running backs get hurt last season, and adding a player like Penny would make it easier to withstand those injuries.\n\nAt the same time, though, the Seahawks have a lot of bodies at running back, and only one football to go around. We may see the team go with a running back by committee approach this season, which could keep Penny off the field early on in the season.\n\nShaquem Griffin, LB, Central Florida\n\nAt the NFL combine, Griffin—who lost his left hand due to a birth defect—recorded 20 repetitions in the bench press. That’s more than any other linebacker in this draft. Griffin’s story is an amazing one, and it’s something he’s going to have to use to his advantage as he tries to become a player in the NFL.\n\nThere are already comparisons to Antonio Brown, but Griffin won’t be on the field in the slot. Instead, he’ll likely play weakside linebacker, where his run defense will be an asset.\n\nGriffin’s draft grade was a seventh-round pick or an undrafted free agent, so the Seahawks could’ve waited until the later rounds to select him. Instead, they selected him in the third round, meaning that the team really believes in him.\n\nLook for him to make the final 53-man roster, but for him to have a chance at being active on game days, he’s going to need to be a standout special"
"Windows 10 in particular has a new background image every day, for example, which you can set to change your lock screen wallpaper on the fly. We’re going to show you how to change your desktop wallpaper too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10 has the ability to let you choose which photo you want to have as your wallpaper, so you can use your favorite wallpaper even if it’s not currently being used as a default for the lock screen. It’s super simple to use the same image for both, and this article will show you how to do it.\n\nFind a Photo\n\nThe first step is to find a photo you want to use for your wallpaper, which you’ll then use as a custom background image for your desktop. This can be any photo you like, but you can also use a full screen wallpaper, if you like. You can browse your own pictures or those of friends and family, and you can download one from a website. Whatever you choose, make sure you know where the photo is on your computer before proceeding.\n\nOpen Settings\n\nIn order to change your wallpaper, you’ll need to open the Settings app on your PC. In Windows 10, you can get there by clicking the Settings icon in the Start menu, or the Settings icon in the Windows taskbar.\n\nScroll Down to “Personalization”\n\nInside the Settings app, click the Personalization option in the left-hand navigation pane.\n\nChoose the Desktop option\n\nOn the right-hand side, click the “Desktop” option. This is the icon in the upper-left corner.\n\nScroll down to the Background section\n\nYou’ll see the option to change the desktop wallpaper at the top of the Desktop screen, but first, scroll down to the “Choose a Desktop Background” section.\n\nSelect the photo\n\nClick the “Browse” button under “Photo”, then navigate to and select the photo you want to use for your desktop wallpaper. Once you’ve selected the photo, click the “Choose” button at the bottom of the screen to apply your changes.\n\nApply your wallpaper changes\n\nTo apply your wallpaper changes, click the “Apply” button at the bottom of the screen.\n\nYou’ll see a preview of your wallpaper, and the “Apply” button will change to “Save”.

"\"The world is getting warmer, and I am getting hotter,\" Victoria Arlen told the audience at a fundraiser in New York City for her Swim Across America Foundation. Arlen, who was born with cerebral palsy, has already swum across the English Channel and the Catalina Channel. She wants to raise money for kids with disabilities to help them get into sports. It was a great way to bring attention to a worthy cause, with an awesome athlete telling a story that's about more than her. That's a good thing.\n\nArlen's efforts are raising awareness, but they're also raising eyebrows. Some people wonder whether her swimming exploits are anything more than swimming feats. One of them is CrossFit.com, a website that contains, among other things, articles on the world of competitive fitness. In an article titled \"Victoria Arlen and the age of weaponized privilege,\" author Allison Geswein made some valid points about the way Arlen is being supported by people with money, but used them to promote her own opinions about who should be able to have access to athletic activities. She also didn't seem to want to understand what it was like to be Arlen, but instead wished that Arlen had been born with more normal physical capabilities.\n\nShe wrote, \"This is a girl whose physical condition is so obvious she gets a special gift at the ESPY awards. And people do not hesitate to declare her brave, and inspirational. Her experience is the exact opposite of the only athlete I ever saw in person who got a standing ovation at an ESPYs — Army Lt. Dan Choi. Choi's obvious struggle was because of what he stood up for, while Arlen's obvious disability is overlooked in a story about what a badass she is.\"\n\nGeswein is concerned with what she calls \"weaponized privilege,\" the idea that certain people with resources can be so over-the-top supportive of an athlete that they create a scenario that isn't fair to the rest of the field. She's concerned that the push to have more diversity in sports, and more opportunities for people with disabilities, is being taken advantage of by someone she thinks has no real athletic ability.\n\nGeswein writes, \"An elite, but not particularly talented, athlete is using her massive reach on social media to get attention for herself, while claiming she's doing it for other people.\"\n\nI can see her point, but I disagree with her opinions on Arlen. The truth is that, from my perspective, Arlen has plenty of athletic ability. And not only that, but she has the ability to draw attention to a cause. This week, USA Today published an article in which they called her \"one of the most inspiring people in sports.\"\n\nIt's one thing to call someone inspiring, and it's another thing to say that they're only inspiring. I've seen Arlen in action. Yes, she has a disability. Yes, she has more going on than the average person, and it's going to affect the way she does things. But, so what? So do a lot of athletes. The truth is that people with disabilities, and people who have had health issues, are human. They are not machines. They are not superhuman. They are not robots. They are people.\n\nArlen swims for a reason. She's not the first athlete to swim to raise money for a cause. Nobody is forcing her to do anything. She's doing it for her. She's trying to do what she can. And that's what makes her awesome.\n\nFollow @MadelineChi on Twitter.<|endoftext|>View All Reviews Reviews For 1.

When he was 11 years old, his father bought him his first bow.\n\n\"My dad bought me a bow, and I just went out in the backyard and shot and shot and shot,\" he said. \"I shot every day and I got better every day.\"\n\nHe didn't hit the international level until he was 13 years old. In fact, he didn't even know what archery was until he went to an international tournament in New Mexico when he was 12 years old.\n\n\"I went and shot my first tournament and I started shooting international tournaments, and I was doing well,\" he said. \"Then, I moved on to the Junior Olympics and then it got more competitive.\"\n\nIt was at that point he realized that he really had a talent.\n\n\"I was pretty good, but not the best,\" he said. \"But then I moved up to the Junior Olympics, and then I got to shooting against the top juniors in the world.\"\n\nHe placed ninth at the 2000 Junior Olympics in Australia.\n\n\"I remember we were in the team compound, and I started shooting my arrows, and the girls I was shooting with were like, 'Wow, you're really good,'\" he said. \"They were like, 'You know what? You're going to the Olympics. You're going to make the Olympic team.' I was like, 'Yeah right.' It took me a couple of years to believe it.\"\n\nHe did not go to the Olympics in 2004.

I can tell you exactly what happened. We had gone for some campaign work and we were about to enter a village and my husband was in front and his security was behind him, when suddenly, we saw a group of people coming from the bushes.\n\n\n\n“I was in the car behind him and I saw them. They were shouting. We were in the car and they stopped him and told him to get out and before he got out of the car, they shot him. He died instantly,” Madam Comfort Akyea narrated.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, when the militants saw the security personnel and she come out of the car, they took her to a bushy area and started threatening her to leave the place.\n\n\n\n“They started threatening me and I was like ‘no, no’, because I am a Christian and I know I could not leave my husband there like that. So I insisted that I would not leave. I told them I have nowhere to go,” she recounted.\n\n\n\nAccording to Madam Comfort Akyea, she went to check on her late husband, but he was already dead.\n\n\n\n“So, they told me that I should come out of the car. They took my driver and left the car behind and I was sitting in the back of the car and they came to me and started threatening me and said they were going to kill me if I do not leave the car and that if I do not leave, they will shoot me,” she added.\n\n\n\nShe said they took her out of the car and forced her into the bush and started threatening her to leave and in the process she hurt her right knee.\n\n\n\nAccording to Madam Comfort Akyea, she got a call from one of the officials of the CPP and the police and military were called in to rescue her.\n\n\n\n“They called someone to call me on my phone and told me to go back to my car and told me that they were going to shoot me. They started shooting me and I fell down and hurt my knee.

They were a bit late and the people were still there,” she said.\n\n\n\nThe widow of the deceased told DAILY GUIDE that the government failed to take a decisive action against the culprits.\n\n\n\n“We were shocked that it happened that way because we had been following the reports on the news that he had been transferred to the police. But after the transfer, it was worse and he was killed,” she lamented.\n\n\n\nShe said she would be sending in the form of her husband’s death to the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) and she expected the government to do something about it.\n\n\n\nMadam Comfort Akyea noted that if the government was going to protect some citizens, it must protect all citizens, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\n\n\nShe was quick to add that since her husband’s death, some individuals who claimed to be associated with the ruling party had visited her home to threaten her.\n\n\n\nShe said they threatened her to stop making statements to the media, adding that they also warned her that if she did not stop, she would meet the same fate as her late husband.\n\n\n\nThe widow said she would be taking up the matter with the police to protect her.\n\n\n\nThe Executive Director of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), Kofi Adams, who spoke to DAILY GUIDE on the matter, said Madam Comfort Akyea had sent in the necessary forms to the CHRAJ to seek redress over her husband’s death.\n\n\n\nMr. Adams said the widow had explained to the commission that there was need to probe her husband’s death.\n\n\n\nHe said the CDHR believed that Mr. Akyea was an innocent victim of the militancy activities in the Northern Region and urged the government to protect its citizens.\n\n\n\nMr. Adams said the CPP should be investigated for its involvement in the death of Mr. Akyea.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer of Citi FM, Edmund Obeng Amponsah, who spoke to DAILY GUIDE in an interview, said he was happy to know that Mrs. Akyea had indicated that she was not interested in politics anymore.\n\n\n\nMr. Amponsah said he was shocked to know that a widow of a prominent politician was intimidated by some people who claimed to be associated with the ruling NDC, adding that Mrs. Akyea was well aware that her husband was killed.\n\n\n\n“It is a pity for a person who is a wife of a politician to be threatened.

The agreement, launched by French President Emmanuel Macron, was initially signed by the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Senegal, Indonesia, Singapore, and Spain. France, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and the European Union have since joined. The Christchurch Call’s stated purpose is “to protect citizens online and promote the development of technology to better protect users.”\n\nOne proposal contained in the pledge is for companies to provide “private right of action for online intermediaries to protect users.” The companies would be required to “develop and implement policies and measures to foster respect for online safety and digital security of users,” and make these policies publicly available. Additionally, companies would be required to implement “cooperative mechanisms” for sharing “appropriate and lawful user data.”\n\nThe Christchurch Call’s language around private action and data sharing is not new. It does not depart from existing obligations to share data and requires companies to take reasonable measures to combat the threat of terrorist content. Nonetheless, the pledge suggests that public enforcement of laws on private platforms is not enough and that further enforcement tools are needed.\n\nArticle Topics\n\naccess<|endoftext|>The Social Studies lesson is connected with science when we studied about the stars.

Bad language is what one might encounter in slums or in prison, while non-standard dialect is the language that you might encounter in regional speech. Standard English, in that sense, is the non-standard dialect of people of quality.\n\nDerek Attridge's point, however, is that standard English and bad language are really not so different. Language itself is an arbitrary set of conventions. The only reason why we have English speakers today is because some group of Anglo-Saxons decided to create a specific set of linguistic conventions.\n\nIf a new group of people were to colonize the US, they could create a new set of linguistic conventions and from that point on everyone would be speaking the new language. No one has an inherent right to the use of English. They can use it because they are powerful and/or because they are respected and/or because they have an intrinsic desire to be an active participant in the community of people who speak English.\n\nThere is nothing special about English. As the British comedian Stephen Fry puts it, English is just the language that he happened to hear when he was a baby, the same way that a child in America hears English and a child in France hears French.\n\nDerek Attridge's point is that we don't see people of quality engage in the use of bad language, but we also don't see them engaging in the use of non-standard dialect.\n\nI would argue that there is a form of bad language that we do not see in the 21st century. That is bad language that is directed towards a particular individual or group. We call that kind of bad language \"hate speech\".\n\nThere was a time in the early 20th century when it was considered \"bad\" to use words that referred to people of color. That was not because that language was \"non-standard\" but rather because it was seen as a form of hate speech that was designed to degrade the group to which it referred. The same holds for other categories of people including women, the poor, the disabled, Jews, Catholics, and the list goes on.\n\nAt that time, there were laws in place to enforce that prohibition. The example that comes to mind is a play called \"Abraham Lincoln\" which portrayed Abraham Lincoln in a way that was considered offensive by many Americans.\n\nAs you may know, the production of that play in New York City was the result of a long legal battle in which the courts ruled in favor of those who felt that the production of that play was in violation of the First Amendment.\n\nToday, we are not as aware of the hate speech directed at people of color, women, the disabled, the poor, and so on. When we do encounter it, however, we generally feel a deep sense of shame. The use of language to degrade someone else because of their race, gender, or sexual orientation is viewed as a symptom of a failure of our society.\n\nThat is why we see the rise of the \"public shaming\" of bigots. Instead of having the law, we now expect people to discipline themselves, to police themselves.\n\nIn fact, it may even be the case that there are certain forms of hate speech that the law does not even address. For example, if I were to use the word \"gay\" as a slur, the law might not be able to prosecute me, because it is the social practice of many people not to use that word to refer to homosexuals, even if it is technically in the dictionary.\n\nThe same is true for other words. For example, the use of the word \"retard\" as a slur for the disabled is becoming less acceptable. People still use that word, but they are aware that it is offensive, and so there is a pressure on them to avoid it.\n\nIn short, what we might be seeing is the gradual rise of the standard dialect, such that people are less and less likely to use language that is offensive to others. But what about those words that are offensive because they are simply incorrect?\n\nIf there is no such thing as \"non-standard dialect\", what we are really talking about is language that is, simply put, wrong. Those of us who are the least educated and the least socially powerful are those most likely to speak incorrect or even incoherent language. We need to be corrected, so that we are aware of how to use language correctly.\n\nThe use of language is an act of respect. When people are mistreated, the language that is used is often hurtful and abusive. When we learn to use language properly, then we will see a greater respect for other people.\n\nPhoto by Pixelgrafica .\n\nPhoto by Mr TinDC .\n\nResources\n\nBibliography<|endoftext|>Is Lee \"Jaedong\" Jae Dong playing as Zerg again? After it seemed the Terran switch was inevitable after last season's World Championship Series (WCS) Korea event, Jaedong played the two newest maps of Season 3 in the round of 32 at IEM Cologne. It appears Jaedong may be leaning towards Zerg in the future, but his current plan remains to play whatever race gets him to the round of 8.\n\nAs someone who has followed and watched Jaedong play for years, it was very obvious at IEM Cologne that he was very uncomfortable playing as a Terran. This is nothing new as Jaedong has always played worse when he was trying to transition to a new race, and his non-Zerg games in the past have always been weaker than his Zerg games. It was shocking to see Jaedong play as Terran, as his play was very weak, and at times even embarrassing.\n\nMany of his decisions in the round of 32 game against Revival was questionable, but it was clear Jaedong was thinking through a lot of things in his head. It's also clear that playing against a player like Revival, who was much stronger than the other Terran in the group, meant Jaedong was being put in an extremely disadvantageous position.\n\nJaedong had a really hard time defending, as Revival was constantly applying pressure and could almost always pick him off with a frontal attack. Jaedong would often let Revival have one of his bases, and in some cases an entire base. His defense was really weak, and in general he just didn't have a solid understanding of how to play the matchup.\n\nWhile Jaedong's TvT didn't look very good, his ZvT game against Dark in the loser's bracket was fantastic. Jaedong's decision to stay on Zerg in the round of 8 was a decision he made before the game even started, and he was in the winner's bracket of the group. If he had been playing ZvZ, he would have already been out of the tournament.\n\nIt's worth noting that Jaedong's ZvT wasn't the same caliber as his ZvZ, and it was just as bad as his TvT. His main weakness in this match was how he dealt with Dark's roach timings. He didn't always make the correct defense, and as a result Dark was able to punish him quite easily. Jaedong's biggest issue in the ZvT matchup is trying to figure out a build that he can feel confident in.\n\nThis is a big issue because"
"Head Start's role in poverty reduction: Preliminary evidence from New York City\n\nDiane Schanzenbach, Jean-Pierre Vincent\n\nIn the United States, children from low-income families are disproportionately at risk of experiencing developmental delays. However, there is a growing body of evidence that targeted interventions can improve these outcomes. In this column, the authors assess Head Start, a preschool program that is one of the largest, most intensive early childhood interventions in the US. They show that a child who participated in Head Start in the late 1980s and early 1990s was less likely to be in poverty as an adult.\n\nDespite decades of effort, US child poverty rates are still unacceptably high. In 2011, nearly one in five children was in poverty (18%), with African-American and Hispanic children experiencing child poverty rates more than twice that of non-Hispanic whites. The persistence of child poverty is worrying. A growing body of evidence suggests that the first few years of life are particularly important for long-term outcomes. Children who are not supported during their earliest years may struggle to keep pace with their peers and, without assistance, may have difficulty moving beyond the disadvantages that plague low-income families.\n\nThe role of targeted early childhood interventions\n\nThe potential of targeted early childhood interventions to ameliorate the effects of poverty is illustrated by the results of several recent experimental evaluations (Barnett 2001, Currie 2009, Duncan and Magnuson 2011). For example, the evaluation of the Perry Preschool Project found that, in the 1960s, children randomly assigned to participate in an early childhood intervention experienced long-term increases in their educational attainment, wages, and family income.1 They also experienced improved health and lower rates of criminal behaviour and teenage pregnancy. Similarly, the evaluation of the Abecedarian Project, which began in the 1970s, found that, at age twenty-five, children who had participated in a high-quality early childhood programme as preschoolers were significantly less likely to be in poverty, less likely to have received public assistance, and less likely to have received food stamps, welfare, or other cash assistance as adults than their comparison group counterparts.2\n\nOne of the largest and most intensive early childhood interventions in the US is Head Start. As such, it provides an important opportunity to examine the long-term impacts of a large-scale public investment in early childhood education. In a new paper, we use administrative data to assess the long-term impacts of Head Start on child and adult outcomes (Schanzenbach and Vincent 2015).\n\nHead Start\n\nThe Head Start programme provides comprehensive early childhood education to low-income children aged three to five. Programmes are administered by non-profit organisations or local education agencies and provide educational, health, nutritional, and other social services to enrolled children and their families. Children are enrolled in Head Start by their families and may remain enrolled for as long as three years.\n\nHead Start enrolment has grown substantially over time. In 1965, Congress passed the Head Start Act with the goal of providing preschool to every low-income four-year-old in the country. To date, Head Start has served more than one million children. Enrolment has grown substantially in recent years due to an influx of funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and subsequent legislation. As of 2014, Head Start served nearly one million children, an increase of 33% from 2009. Over half of the four-year-olds served by Head Start are from low-income families.3\n\nOur research\n\nWhile there have been several experimental evaluations of Head Start, to date there has been no large-scale, randomised controlled trial of the programme. As such, the estimated effects of Head Start are based on a combination of experimental studies and observational studies. A meta-analysis of the literature concluded that early Head Start participation improves cognitive skills and leads to a small reduction in behavioural problems. The impact on achievement, however, was small and no longer statistically significant when attrition was taken into account.4\n\nIn our paper, we build on these findings by using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to assess the long-term impacts of Head Start.5 The NLSY is a nationally representative sample of individuals who were aged 12 to 16 years in 1979. It includes detailed data on the characteristics of both NLSY members and their families. These data allow us to construct a sample of NLSY members who were eligible for Head Start in 1979 and to follow their subsequent lives over time.\n\nWe use several approaches to analyse the long-term impacts of Head Start participation. First, we assess whether Head Start participation influences child poverty status. In the case of child poverty, our results suggest that children who participated in Head Start are less likely to be in poverty than children who were eligible but did not participate in Head Start.\n\nNext, we consider the impact of Head Start on employment and earnings. We find that, when looking at both men and women, children who participated in Head Start have higher levels of employment and higher levels of earnings than children who were eligible but did not participate. Moreover, the impact of Head Start participation is larger for men than women. This finding is consistent with the fact that boys, who are more likely to be enrolled in Head Start, also have higher levels of employment and earnings than girls in the NLSY sample.\n\nFinally, we explore the effects of Head Start participation on a wide range of health and behavioural outcomes. These include both current health outcomes, such as obesity and hospitalisation, as well as long-term health outcomes, such as obesity and high cholesterol. While there is little evidence of impacts on these outcomes for children who were enrolled in Head Start, we do find that participating in Head Start improves adult health outcomes. Specifically, we find that men who participated in Head Start are less likely to be obese than men who were eligible but did not participate. In addition, men who participated in Head Start have lower cholesterol levels and are less likely to be diagnosed with high cholesterol than men who were eligible but did not participate.\n\nOur findings indicate that Head Start participation appears to increase labour market success and, in particular, the employment and earnings of men. In addition, Head Start participation appears to improve adult health outcomes.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nOur research suggests that Head Start is associated with long-term improvements in child poverty, adult employment, and adult health outcomes. However, there is much we still do not know about the effects of Head Start. We do not know, for example, the relative importance of the Head Start programme itself, as opposed to the resources that families receive through Head Start, in accounting for its impacts. In addition, we do not know the precise mechanisms through which Head Start may influence the long-term outcomes of participants. Finally, we are unable to assess the relative importance of Head Start participation on the life outcomes of participants. Our findings, in short, are preliminary and suggestive. Additional research is required to build on the insights presented here and to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the impacts of Head Start.\n\nReferences\n\nBarnett, W (2001), \"Estimating the Return to Head Start\", American Economic Review, 91: 1586–1608.\n\nCurrie, J (2009), \"The Long-Term Effects of Head Start\", American Economic Review, 99: 1867–1894.\n\nDuncan, G and Magnuson, K (2011), \"Early Childhood Programs and Chronic Offending: Evidence from Head Start\", Journal of Human Resources, 46: 499–528.\n\nMeyer, B, Bates, J, Head Start Impact Study Group (2010), \"The Impact of Head Start on Children, Families, and Communities\", Journal of the American Medical Association, 303: 1338–1345.\n\nNational Center for Education Statistics (2014), \"Digest of Education Statistics\", Tables 101, 102, 104.\n\nSchanzenbach, D and Vincent, J P (2015), \"Head Start's Role in Reducing Child Poverty\", NBER Working Paper 20750.<|endoftext|>Alex Bozich 04/01/2015 1:56 pm in Commentary\n\nIndiana takes on North Carolina on Sunday evening at 9 p.m. ET (CBS) in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament in Indianapolis.\n\nNorth Carolina is a No. 5 seed in the South Region and Indiana is the No. 3 seed.\n\nThis is a rematch of a game played on Nov. 18 in Chapel Hill that the Hoosiers won, 64-59.\n\nIf Indiana wins, it will advance to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2002.\n\nMEET THE DEMONS\n\nNorth Carolina enters the game on a hot streak that has included six wins in its last seven games.

"She wasn't a woman like any other. Even though she had her faults, she still stood out from the rest of the crowd. She had a history, a background and an experience that many people dreamt of having, yet only few ever got the opportunity. What most people didn't know was that she wasn't exactly the kind of person to brag about her past, even though she felt proud of it. It had been a dream for her, a little girl, to see the world and she'd seen it, all of it. The rich, the poor, the bright, the darkness, the weird, the strange, the beautiful and the ugly. She'd seen it all and it was magnificent, yet there was a reason why she had chosen to become a librarian, instead of something else.\n\n\n\nHer hair was long, silver and wavy and fell down her shoulders in a beautiful manner. Her blue eyes had seen so much, yet they still seemed to sparkle with life. Her voice was calm and soothing, a voice one could lean back and close their eyes to. One would never imagine her as a warrior, but in her past, she was just that. She'd fought many battles, killed many men and women and survived through it all. She had friends and she had enemies and she was proud of it. She was happy and she was content and she was satisfied with the life she'd lived, until she met him. They fell in love at first sight and it took some time, but she accepted it and decided to move forward.\n\n\n\nLife went by and as it did, they became closer and closer. They married and had children, which made her life complete. She couldn't have been happier, even though they all knew it was a big lie. A lie that no one told her, no one really wanted to see her get hurt. They had the best family they could possibly have and that's all that really mattered, right? They'd always been together, until the day he decided to go out and do some hunting. She didn't want him to go, but he promised her he'd be back soon and not to worry. That was, however, a lie, for she never saw him again. There were rumours, many rumours, but nothing was confirmed. Until she received a letter.\n\n\n\nA letter telling her he was dead and he would never come back. It hurt and it hurt her to the core, but what was done was done. She had to go on with her life and she did. She got married again, but he wasn't right. She found out he was cheating on her, but she stayed with him. That was until she decided that she'd had enough and divorced him. She'd left the country, left the world and found a place that was perfect for her, where she'd be happy and finally found peace. It was here that she got the news of her brother's death.\n\n\n\nHis wife was distraught and his children had gone missing. Her mother was ill and had taken a turn for the worse. There was a war and the whole country was about to crumble. She went to visit her mother and stayed there for the rest of her life, dying peacefully. She had seen a lot of things and she'd been through a lot, but there were still things she'd never done. She'd never married the man of her dreams and she'd never had the chance to tell him that she loved him. She lived a full life, though and she was happy about that, even if it hurt sometimes. Her past had played a big part in who she was and she never regretted any of it.\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Hello there,\n\nAs you can see I need a graphic designer to design a Christmas flyer for my business.\n\nThe flyer will be printed and posted in business buildings around my area.\n\nThe design needs to be really good quality and very eye catching.\n\nThe last flyer that I posted was done very poorly and this time I need it to be perfect.\n\nIf you think you can do a great job for me I will hire you and give you all the details.\n\nThank you for looking.<|endoftext|>I had three requests for it the other night at my last appearance at our local British Car Night at the local pub, but I said no. \"No\", I said, \"I cannot in good conscience drive a Morris Minor.\" I may have been wearing some sort of red cross armband at the time.\n\nSee, I was there to talk about the Humber, the vehicle that I restored. You may not think that you'd have trouble remembering a simple, if unusual, name like that, but the Humber isn't one of the more familiar marques. You don't really see Humber models on the road, nor do you find them at your local autocross. But it's a long story.\n\nI grew up in the late '60s and early '70s, and a lot of my friends had small cars. All had Chevys or Chryslers. I had a small car too, but it was a Ford Anglia.\n\nThe Anglia was, at the time, one of Ford's new \"compact\" cars. When I got it, it was the sportier version of the compact Ford, with a spiffy two-tone paint scheme. It was small and fairly light, but I loved it and it made me a part of my social group. It had an appealing vintage look. But then I got the Humber.\n\nI saw it one day in the parking lot of my college, which was known as an art school. It was brown, had a real body and glass, a nice interior and an engine under the hood. It had hubcaps with those little wings. It was cool. It was interesting. It was British.\n\nI took a drive in it and it was, well, wobbly. But so was I, so it was hard to tell which was wobblier, me or the car. So I got the owner's phone number and called him and we haggled a bit and I bought it.\n\nYou don't really find many Humber sedans. They were more of a taxi cab/coupe type of vehicle. In England, they were made by the Rootes Group and in the U.S. they were imported and sold by Graham-Paige, which was a small automobile manufacturer that competed with the much larger GM, Ford and Chrysler companies.\n\nI guess the main reason I didn't want to talk about the Humber was that the car was unusual and, to the people who don't know cars, it would be hard to explain the basics. I didn't want to take the time, really. I was there to talk about the Humber as a sports car.\n\nFirst off, the Humber, by modern standards, is tiny. When I got it, I had to keep the clutch pushed in a bit and push on the accelerator at the same time to get it to go in gear. It's the same story with reverse. After it got the electric fuel pump, I never touched the clutch except to put it in reverse. And it had a three-speed manual on the column with a shifter that moved laterally, not vertically.\n\nThe car was made in England by Humber. It was a Rootes Group model and so were the Sunbeam, Singer and Hillman. A bit of trivia: The same folks who owned the Humber company also owned the Rootes Group, the company that made the Hillman Minx, a car that was a sort of English answer to the VW Beetle.\n\nThe Humber was a grand tourer, designed for touring, and not for hauling. As such, it was light, weighing about a ton and a half, which was the weight of the VW Beetle. It was a nice-looking car and the body was an aircraft-inspired monocoque structure, a term that would impress most people who don't know cars, but doesn't do a whole lot to tell you much about what it was.\n\nMost people would see it and say, \"Wow, what a neat little car.\" They'd say it wasn't very powerful. They'd say it was nice looking, but underpowered. They'd say they didn't know much about it and, because it was so light, they might say it was a little bit dangerous. And that's where I'd be left hanging.\n\nSo, to cut to the chase, I'd tell them a little about it, and then they'd ask a question about it. The thing is, it is a unique vehicle and to know a little about it and to be able to answer a question about it, they'd have to have some information. So I'd say, \"You know, it's not my car. It's my son's car. He owns a Lotus. He has a very nice Lotus. He likes to race it. He's a bit crazy.\"\n\nAnd then I'd leave.<|endoftext|>A St. Marys man has been accused of soliciting and having sex with a girl who was only 13 years old, according to St. Marys police.\n\nPolice said Derek Walter Peters, 25, of the 300 block of East Market Street, St. Marys, solicited a minor for sex on May 8.

My old keyboard was becoming really noisy to use, and I found that it caused a lot of pain in my wrists after some time of use. A couple of my friends use ErgoDox, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThere are quite a few resources on how to put together an ErgoDox, but I wanted to make mine a bit easier to use. The keys are split between two halves, which is often called the left and right brain. When I was first working on the keyboard, I would often reach for the wrong keys and hit the wrong half. Also, I wanted to create a more comfortable keyboard for my wrists, as they often get sore after using the ErgoDox for a few hours. The result is this setup:\n\nFirst, I took a gaming mousepad and glued it to the left half of the keyboard, and cut a hole for the thumb cluster. I also cut off the feet of the keyboard, and used the rubber pads of the mousepad to glue them on the bottom of the keyboard. This makes the keyboard more comfortable to use, since the edges of the keyboard are no longer uncomfortable to touch.\n\nThe keycaps are not correct in the image, since I took them off to get to the next step. In fact, this photo was taken just after I put the keys on the first time.\n\nAs you can see in the image, the thumb cluster on the left half is the same as on the right half. I also took off the thumb keys on the right half, so that it’s more comfortable to hold and doesn’t press on the mousepad.\n\nFor the thumb cluster, I used a cheap office keyboard. The office keyboard is much better in quality than the gaming keyboard, so I could easily place it on the same plate as the rest of the keyboard. Since the office keyboard has a special keycap, I bought a replacement in the keycaps store. The keycap does not need to be replaced, since the new version has the same indentation as the original one.\n\nOverall, the keyboard feels really good. I haven’t used the ErgoDox for very long, so I cannot really say how it compares to the usual ErgoDox. My wrists don’t hurt as much as before, and the keyboard itself is very comfortable.\n\nPS: You can follow me on Twitter.<|endoftext|>Case for the defence: Key assets in Australia are still owned by the British, the economy has performed far better than most other Western economies, and the Queen has been a good sport. On the debit side, everyone seems to know that most Australians want to get rid of the monarchy.\n\nBritain has been Australia’s biggest trading partner for over a century. The country is now seen as the gateway to the booming region of Asia. While Australia’s coal and gas exports remain big earners, the growth is coming from its burgeoning services and technology sectors.\n\nAustralia is the world’s 12th largest economy and is one of the world’s highest per capita producers of oil and gas. It is a wealthy country, with its citizens enjoying a standard of living well above that of Britain.\n\nIn the past 20 years the federal government’s spending has averaged 29pc of the economy and government debt has averaged 10pc. The state of the Australian economy is not that bad, considering how disastrous the British economy has been since 2007.\n\nIn the past year, a government debt of $29bn was added to a gross debt of $260bn. Australia’s bond yield is 1.5pc, lower than Britain’s.\n\nBut compared to Britain’s £1.8 trillion debt (94pc of GDP), Australia’s is still small. Its economic record is more impressive than the headlines suggest, and is arguably better than the United States, which has the world’s biggest economy.\n\nBetween the financial crisis of 2008 and 2013, Australia’s economy grew 4.2pc per year, the best in the G20. It has continued to grow, by 2.8pc last year.\n\nOn current forecasts, it will expand by 3.5pc this year and 3.3pc next. That compares to 2.5pc in the US, 2.3pc in Germany, 1.9pc in Japan, 1.6pc in Britain, and 1.2pc in France.\n\nBritain is in a mess. The government deficit, or annual overspend, is 5pc of GDP. It means a deficit of £75bn. A fifth of the economy is not generating enough income to meet the costs of the public sector.\n\nBut what does this mean in practice? The deficit is equivalent to about £2,500 per person per year. In the US, the equivalent figure is £5,600 per person. The UK is not the only country running a huge deficit, although it is the worst.\n\nGermany has run a budget deficit of 3pc since 2007, and Japan of 2.8pc. The deficit has worsened in France and Italy, where it has topped 5pc, while Greece has the biggest deficit of all, at 11pc. The high-debt model is not confined to the UK.\n\nIn Australia, the state borrows $3,500 per person. As well as supporting its social safety net, this enables the government to invest in the future and provide essential services. But this means that it has to pay a high price.\n\nIn the past five years, government borrowing has been the equivalent of 12pc of GDP. In Britain, it has been 8pc.\n\nThe public sector has to pay more for its debt, as interest payments now consume 11pc of government spending. But that is still much lower than the UK.\n\nThe main problem for the government is that as a result of the overspend, the budget deficit has blown out to 5pc of GDP. But in the past year, tax revenues have fallen back by 3pc.\n\nThis has been partly due to the high Australian dollar and the fall in commodity prices, which have hit the mining sector.\n\nIt has also reflected the sluggish global economy and the end of the China-fuelled mining boom, which has led to a fall in capital investment.\n\nBut the big drag on growth has been the federal government, whose spending grew by 4.4pc. That is partly due to increased spending on health and education.\n\nThe budget deficit was not a temporary surge but a structural problem, reflecting the fact that too much money is being spent. In Britain, the problem is not so much the size of the deficit as the debt, which keeps growing.\n\nThat is because the British government cannot control spending. Last year it was 48pc of GDP, twice the average for the G20.\n\nThe budget deficit is at an all-time high, and will be 5.4pc this year, or £75bn. The deficit is 4.1pc of GDP, which is more than the 3pc the government said was sustainable.\n\nGrowth has been sluggish, with annual growth of 1.7pc since the end of 2012. It will be slower this year, when the economy is likely to expand by only 1.4pc.\n\nThe austerity measures in the budget have reduced"

La situación era bastante compleja porque en el inmueble había una vivienda, una construcción inacabada y tres estructuras que el constructor del primer edificio dejó sin acabar y a la que todos los trabajadores consultados aseguraban que no se iban a meter.\n\nDe los que contestaron, unos no contestaron más, otra de las empresas (de una de las constructoras de las cuales me informaron) no aceptó el proyecto y el resto fue lo siguiente:\n\nEl primer contacto\n\nEl primer contacto que se hizo conmigo fue un tipo que no estaba registrado como arquitecto en el ayuntamiento, ni como profesional que realiza obras (de forma oficial) en el que al parecer solo trabajaba, y me hizo una visita para hacerse una idea del proyecto. Luego de una visita muy escueta, dijo que podía hacerse, pero que en las cuentas finalizaría con una diferencia de dinero de unos 5.000 €. Así pues, no lo contraté.\n\nEl segundo contacto\n\nEl segundo contacto era otro arquitecto que también me había puesto la constructora. Se hizo una visita y luego llamó al constructor de las obras inacabadas, le preguntó por los materiales de las obras de la construcción del edificio de enfrente y así asegurarse de que se iba a poder acabar la obra. El constructor no le dio problema, y así pues, tampoco me contactó más.\n\nEl tercer contacto\n\nEl tercer contacto, una arquitecto que estaba registrada en el ayuntamiento como arquitecto y que estaba de novio con el que me contestó en el segundo contacto, así que mejor dejarlo.\n\nEl cuarto contacto\n\nEl cuarto contacto, otra empresa que ya había estado vinculada a la constructora de las obras del edificio de enfrente, que en un principio estaba dispuesta a efectuar el trabajo, pero que al final no quiso el proyecto.\n\nEl quinto contacto\n\nEl quinto contacto, era un arquitecto que había dejado en estado de obra a unas viviendas en el mismo barrio. La visita fue muy escueta y cuando terminó, el arquitecto me dijo que cuando termine, yo volvería para pagar y que me iba a encargar de la administración. No se pudo hacer la visita, ya que estaba cerrada la puerta de acceso a la construcción.\n\nAl final, encontré a un profesional que era arquitecto y también estudiante de arquitectura, que había realizado un trabajo de estudio y que podía hacer la obra.\n\nQué hacer en estos casos\n\nNo obstante, y a pesar de todo, no quiero dejar esta experiencia sin aportar algunas recomendaciones:\n\nSi os contactan por una obra que va a comenzar, preguntaros si se están haciendo las visitas de obra en el municipio para que puedan hacer el trabajo que se solicita. Si el constructor no está en el municipio, preguntarle si está inscrito en la Comunidad de Madrid (o donde esté en el caso que estéis), si tiene póliza de seguro de responsabilidad civil (también en la comunidad de Madrid), si tiene garantía de obra y de trabajo. Esto último puede ser un problema, ya que muchas veces las empresas te dan la garantía de obra, pero la garantía de trabajo puede ser que se la concedan al empresario, y que no esté disponible para vosotros. En este caso, pedir que lo aclare antes de iniciar la obra, o que se ponga al empresario a dar vueltas por el municipio asegurándose de que el trabajo esté bien realizado.\n\nSi necesitáis ayuda con una obra, arreglo o reforma en vuestra casa, ya sea en el piso, la construcción o la reforma de la cocina, contactad con nuestro equipo de trabajadores a través de nuestra página web o en nuestro teléfono.\n\nTambién, si necesitáis asesoramiento en una obra, no dudeis en poneros en contacto con nosotros a través de nuestro teléfono o por medio de nuestro formulario de contacto.<|endoftext|>- From youtube.com \"It's hot and dusty as Jay makes his way along a dusty road, heading for a ranch near the Texas border.\n\nAccording to the map, the ranch is located just past a bridge and a little creek.

"NEW YORK -- For the first time since the NBA's most recent lockout, it seems like the league might be moving toward a resolution in their collective bargaining talks with the players.\n\nThe two sides are looking to the past in order to settle the current negotiations.\n\nA number of recent reports have suggested the league will use the 2005 collective bargaining agreement as a model for their current talks. That agreement was a work in progress for much of the process, with both sides making concessions that ended up allowing for a new CBA. This time around, the two sides are looking at it as a potential blueprint for an agreement.\n\nAs the two sides talk about it, it appears they are trying to get to that point where both sides have something to show for their sacrifices. They had gotten close enough that a meeting was scheduled for Friday between players and owners. But when the two sides could not agree on where to meet, the meeting was canceled.\n\nPlayers want the league to move off its previous proposal of a 49-51 percent split of revenues. The league also needs to give on its desire to move from a 57-43 split in favor of owners to the much more owner-friendly 54-46 split that was agreed to in the last lockout.\n\nThe most recent reports on the negotiations indicated that the league was willing to make a deal on their desire to drop the players' share of revenues from the current 57 percent. Sources told ESPN.com that the league was willing to move to the 50-50 split that was negotiated in the last round of CBA talks.\n\nThat would be an enormous concession for the owners, who have long wanted the players to move back toward a 50-50 split of revenues.\n\nFrom the players' perspective, there would be some significant concession made in order to get to that 50-50 revenue split.\n\n\"The goal would be to get to that 50-50 and you could come back to a [salary] cap,\" one player said. \"The players have to give on the percentage. There has to be something that goes from the players to get back to 50-50.\"\n\nThe owners have been unable to go back to the cap for a variety of reasons. It would require the players to agree to a massive paycut in order for the owners to get the salary restrictions they have been looking for. Players are not willing to go to a cap until they are able to get what they feel is a much more equitable split of the revenues.\n\nOne potential solution, according to a number of players who spoke to ESPN.com, is to drop the hard salary cap and go to a soft cap in which the owners would have the ability to pay whatever they wanted.\n\nThe players have long been opposed to the hard cap that would keep teams from being able to go over the cap to sign a star player. In the last round of negotiations, the players agreed to a system where teams would be able to go over the cap to sign a star player as long as they were willing to pay the luxury tax.\n\nBut that system has not worked well enough for the players, who believe the new tax system -- which is actually an escrow system -- is not much of a deterrent for owners who are willing to go over the cap to sign a star player.\n\n\"The thing the players hate the most is the hard cap,\" a player said. \"We don't want that. If they could get the hard cap out and move toward a soft cap with a lot of restrictions, the players could do that.\"\n\nThat's not to say the owners wouldn't have some restrictions on them under such a system. The players have long wanted a system where the owners would be allowed to go over the cap to sign a player only if a certain percentage of their cap is already being spent on players who make less than the average salary.\n\nSuch a system could help the owners build a team, but it would prevent them from loading up on high-priced players. It would also ensure that the league didn't have a number of teams that were more interested in avoiding the luxury tax than competing for a championship.\n\nThis is a concept that the players have been talking about for some time. In fact, it was one of the main points they were looking to address when they asked the league for an 18 percent share of revenues earlier this year.\n\nThe two sides are also looking at other issues in their current talks, including a rookie salary cap, the length of the guaranteed contracts and the luxury tax.\n\nMost of those issues have been talked about as being much easier to deal with than the revenue split, which is really what this battle has always been about.\n\nSo what is it going to take to get a deal done?\n\nA player who has talked with some of the players who were involved in the last round of negotiations said there would have to be some sacrifices on both sides to get a deal done.\n\n\"The owners need to take a bigger hit than they want to get to 50-50,\" he said. \"And the players have to come back from 57-43. So you're going to have to have both sides give on what they're willing to give on. The question is whether they will or not.\n\n\"If they don't, we'll be back in the same position as last time.\"<|endoftext|>Last fall, it looked as if the real-estate market was stabilizing after years of decline. The number of residential sales grew sharply as home buyers took advantage of lower prices. Construction crews worked overtime to put up new homes, and by year's end the average price of a new house had fallen to a level not seen since 2007. Some economists, including Joshua Shapiro of MFR, even forecast a healthy real-estate market in 2013.\n\nBut by March, when the latest data were released, the new-home market had slowed. Builders started fewer new houses in the first quarter of the year, and sales of previously owned homes dropped. Sales were not much higher than a year ago, and prices were down 6.5 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, people who want to rent instead of buy are finding more and more competition for the available units, as people who had lost their homes in foreclosure or who had moved to new neighborhoods and had to leave their rentals when their leases expired compete with newcomers for what apartments are available. According to Marcus & Millichap, a real-estate investment-research firm, the number of apartments that went on the market in March was almost half the number available a year earlier, and rents were up 1.1 percent.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut that wasn't the only news in March's housing numbers. One key factor that could speed up the recovery in housing — the fact that millions of foreclosures are coming to a close — was barely noticed, perhaps because this important milestone was expected.\n\n\"That was the big story for me,\" said Christopher Herbert, the managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. \"It was the single largest driver of lower home prices last year.\"\n\nForeclosures have been a major drag on the market since the financial crisis, depressing the prices of other homes in neighborhoods where foreclosures have clustered and even undermining the economy at large.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As a result, the overall inventory of foreclosed homes on the market shrank for the first time in four years.\n\nIt's too soon to declare the end of foreclosures. Many people are still struggling to keep their homes. About 1.9 million homes in the foreclosure process, a total that includes default notices, auctions and bank repossessions, are still not yet in the foreclosure process, according to CoreLogic. And RealtyTrac expects the number of foreclosures to rise this year as a result of the government's mortgage settlement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the housing market has passed a milestone, and now the trend is starting to move in the opposite direction. \"We think it's a game changer,\" said Mark Fleming, the chief economist at CoreLogic.\n\nMore foreclosures mean more available homes. And the inventory of available homes has been shrinking for two years now, according to the National Association of Realtors. That should finally push prices up.\n\n\"When we talk to economists, we keep hearing they think the worst is behind us,\" said Jed Kolko, the chief economist at Trulia. \"I think they're right.

"A judge on Monday declared a mistrial in the case of a Utah mother accused of killing her baby by violently throwing the girl into her crib.\n\nMegan Huntsman was charged with murder in the 2011 death of her infant daughter, who died of a skull fracture and bleeding in the brain.\n\nBut Huntsman said the girl was in a prone position when she accidentally slipped and hit her head in the crib.\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reports that a jury deadlocked Monday on the first-degree murder charge and two counts of child abuse.\n\nJurors had been deliberating for several days on whether to convict Huntsman.\n\nDuring the month-long trial, prosecutors argued Huntsman beat and abused her infant daughter over a long period of time. They also argued the child's skull was fractured and she was strangled by a shirt wrapped around her neck, the newspaper reports.\n\nDuring her own testimony, Huntsman said she did not remember how the girl's head was injured.\n\nDefense attorney Ed Brass argued Huntsman's \"excessive\" use of prescription drugs caused her to not recall the events surrounding the death of her daughter.\n\nAt times, she claimed to have little memory of the month the baby was alive.\n\nHuntsman was pregnant with the girl when she was arrested for killing another daughter born in 2009.

Pagans have been in the past and still are today worshippers of a variety of gods and goddesses. Pagan traditions include the Germanic and Norse pantheons, the Greek and Roman pantheons, and the Celtic pantheon. Paganism today includes Wicca, which is a religion of goddess worship, and Shamanism, which is a religion based on communicating with spirits. Pagan traditions, such as Wicca, do not adhere to the laws of the Christian God or to the authority of the Christian Church. Therefore, they are considered heresy by the Catholic Church. There are many pagan paths, but they all have a great deal in common.\n\nWhat Are The Characteristics Of Paganism?\n\nA primary characteristic of pagan religions is the practice of magic. In Wicca, magic is considered a natural part of the world, and its practitioners consider themselves to be more in tune with the natural world. In pagan religions, the world is seen as an extension of the human body. Everything in the universe is interrelated and interdependent. The Wiccan faith teaches that there are several different planes of existence. Each of these different planes is inhabited by various types of beings, including angels, elementals, and deities. Pagan religions view the universe as being alive. This is very different from the Christian view of the universe as being created by God and sustained by him.\n\nThe belief in a single god is a major difference between pagan religions and Christianity. Pagan religions often worship a large number of gods and goddesses. Pagans often worship female deities, and they often see women as having a special role in the faith. They often see women as being closer to the gods, and they often have religious ceremonies that involve sacred prostitutes.\n\nAnother characteristic of pagan religions is their lack of an afterlife. They do not believe that people have immortal souls that will go to a paradise after they die. Pagans believe that after a person dies, he or she joins the various other spirits and deities in the universe.\n\nPaganism is polytheistic. It is the belief in more than one god or goddess. Paganism is animistic. It is the belief that everything has a spirit or soul.\n\nWhat Is The Purpose Of Paganism?\n\nThe purpose of pagan religions is to worship a variety of gods and goddesses. They worship to gain the favor of these deities. Wiccans worship the goddess because they believe that she gives them life and strength. They also seek her blessings in return for worship. Pagan religions also seek to influence the course of the natural world by using magic. They believe that magic will bring them health, wealth, and happiness.\n\nAre Pagan Practices For Today?\n\nThe beliefs and practices of pagan religions have a long history. Some practices are still practiced by pagans today. For example, ancient pagans practiced sky worship. They believed that each god and goddess represented a different aspect of the sky.\n\nThe pagans also believed in magic. Magic is still used by Wiccans today. Wiccans believe that magic is a way to control nature and change the course of events. Magic is also used to influence the actions of others. Wiccans also practice sky worship and sky gods.<|endoftext|>The world's first floating offshore wind farm has been officially opened off the coast of Copenhagen, hailed as a \"historic\" step towards cleaner energy.\n\nThe 30MW wind farm is made up of five turbines, which will power around 20,000 homes and cut carbon emissions by up to 30,000 tonnes a year, developers said.\n\nEach turbine is tethered to the seabed by a steel tube 18 metres below the water's surface.\n\nJoin Independent Minds For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month Get the best of The Independent With an Independent Minds subscription for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month Get the best of The Independent Without the ads – for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month\n\nThe turbines rise over 100 metres into the air, with blades reaching over 70 metres.\n\nThey are expected to withstand some of the strongest winds and highest waves in the world.\n\nJohanna Haake, a project manager at Vattenfall, which led the project, said: \"This is a historic day for the offshore wind industry.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of the team who have worked tirelessly to make this project a success.\n\n\"Vattenfall are very pleased to have contributed to realising the vision of the wind industry and to showcase the future of green energy production.\"\n\nThe wind farm, which cost £240 million to construct, is located in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, about 5km from Copenhagen, which is often exposed to strong winds.\n\nThe European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) project, a joint venture between Vattenfall, Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) and the Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, consists of 30MW wind turbines with 108m blades, the world’s largest to date.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies<|endoftext|>Find the right combination!

But I need to talk to someone so i can figure out what's wrong with me, or to get some sort of advice, or just to see if this has happened to anyone else or not. I'm a 18 year old girl and a virgin. It was never important to me, it was never a huge deal. I guess it just doesn't seem to be a big deal to me, I'm sure that if I had to give my virginity to someone it would be special to me. I just don't care much about it, I'm not all for saving it until I get married but I don't really see a point in going out and having sex to see what it's like. I have never had the urge to have sex, I don't want to experiment with guys, I just want a relationship. Not that I am looking for one, I haven't had a relationship before but I have a feeling that the first time I get in a relationship it will just feel right, and i will just want to have sex with my partner because it just feels right.\n\n\n\nI'm not the type of person to just have sex with any guy, I need a relationship, I need to know that they love me. It's not that I am a slut or anything like that, I just want to feel like they care about me. I am not against having a one night stand, I just don't want to have sex with someone I don't love, and if I were to have a one night stand it would be with someone I love, so we could make love. I have had the urge to have sex before, but not really for the reason of wanting to try it out, but because I think that if I really like a guy it would be something that would be special to me. The problem I have is that everytime I start dating someone I just fall for them and that makes it impossible for me to have sex with them. I have never had sex, I have never even kissed a guy. I'm sure if I had one I would be able to let go of the past and I would love to kiss someone and just be in a relationship. But I have been in relationships before and it never worked out, I just end up falling for them, and I think I know why that is.\n\n\n\nI guess I've always thought that I was going to meet someone and just instantly know that I was going to fall in love with them, and be with them for the rest of my life. I think that I was just waiting for the perfect guy and that it would happen so fast that I wouldn't even be able to stop it. And that's why I think everytime I have gotten in a relationship I have just felt like I am with the wrong person, I don't feel the chemistry. I have never even liked a guy for more than a month and I'm talking about boys that I was in relationships with. I just feel like the perfect guy is waiting for me somewhere and I'll meet him one day and he'll fall in love with me, and that will be it. I just want to love and be loved, I just want someone that makes me feel special and wanted. I don't want to go out and get drunk and get a guy to sleep with me, I just want to find someone who is willing to be with me and love me for who I am.\n\n\n\nI guess that's the main reason why I am a virgin, because I want someone to be able to love me and I am just too afraid to take a chance on someone. I don't really have a problem with having sex or anything like that, I just don't feel like having sex will be worth it if I don't love the person I'm doing it with. That's just how I am, I don't really have a problem with waiting until I am married to have sex, because i would rather wait until I find the right person. And it is because of this that I haven't really had a relationship and it doesn't really look like I will have one anytime soon. So I guess my question is, how do I get over this, and just go out and have sex and stop thinking about the future, because I don't know if this is a good thing or not. I have a feeling that having sex with the wrong person is going to mess me up even more, I just don't know.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has any advice or just some advice on what I can do to get over this please let me know, because I would really appreciate it.<|endoftext|>Free download and install: iTunes\n\nApostrophes with names (plural or possessive)\n\nCapital letters at the beginning of a sentence\n\nCapitals in names and titles\n\nSpelling of certain words\n\nAbbreviations\n\nTreatment of foreign names\n\nThe article has been rewritten with the advice of the Communications Office of the Department of Education and the new text takes account of changes that have taken place since the original guide was published in 2001.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin to read the updates.<|endoftext|>One of the most-anticipated movie adaptations in years, The Fault in Our Stars was always going to be a risky one. On the one hand, you've got a story by a YA author and a fanbase who are well-versed in dissecting the themes in a story, but on the other hand, you've got a mainstream story in a popular genre, with its major appeal lying in its romantic tragedy. How can the movie balance these things? Well, there are a few answers, but we'll have to wait to see if they work.\n\n1. Write a film that serves the story.\n\nThe author of The Fault in Our Stars is, to put it politely, quite popular, and it's because the story is not only good, but also captures a range of topics that can be discussed on a basic level, but can be deconstructed on a deeper level. It was for this reason that I became so interested in the book, but as is often the case with readers of this kind, the story is often not as important as the commentary. But since this is a film, the story does matter. This movie will rely on the emotion of the story to make the film work, and if that emotion is strained, it will come across in the film.\n\n2. Choose the right actors.\n\nThe casting of The Fault in Our Stars is extremely important, as this story hinges on the chemistry between the actors. If they don't work well together, the audience won't buy their romance, and the actors have to make the connection between the two characters believable. The actors in this case seem to fit the bill, but the chemistry will have to come from the on-screen actors. They won't have the shared history that the book is so interested in, and so will have to create the relationship from scratch, which will be interesting to see if they can do.\n\n3. Avoid clichés.\n\nSince the source material for the film is a YA novel, there are a few tropes to avoid, which the film can get away with if it plays it right. One of the most obvious is the \"true love\" aspect. The Fault in Our Stars has to have this, but it also has to deal with the fact that the girl is terminally ill, and this has to be a large part of the film, and a convincing reason for why she and the boy would be together. As is so often the case, the theme of \"true love\" is a major part of the book, but it can't be played out in a typical way.\n\n4. Don't dwell on the illness.\n\nA major part of the appeal of The Fault in Our Stars is that the two characters have cancer. That's an important part of the story, but there are other things that need to be addressed as well, which can get lost if the illness is treated in a way that's over-the-top. The story can certainly deal with the fact that the boy is at risk of dying, but it also needs to focus on the fact that the girl is also in the same position, and the fact that they are both fighting to be together. If they get lost in their illness, the film could"
"I was there in New York City that night the world stopped to watch the Yankee game and see a major league baseball player commit suicide live on national television. I remember watching a baseball player named Darryl Strawberry walk off the field in shame, as he had been caught buying drugs. I also remember thinking that nobody else knew what to do or how to act, as if everybody was paralyzed in time, wondering how this would play out. The world paused to watch, and with my own children at the time, I thought how could this be.\n\nThe sport of baseball is nothing but the best in the world. What does that say about the world? It is the best and worst of what is human.\n\nWe talk about Mike Trout as a great player. He is the best player in the American League, as a matter of fact, he is a best in the world player. He is an All Star, and on the short list of the best players to ever play the game.\n\nThe sport of baseball is nothing but the best in the world. What does that say about the world? It is the best and worst of what is human.\n\nBaseball is the quintessential American sport, and if you have ever been to a game, you realize that this is not just a game, it is a community. It is a place where people go to celebrate, to connect with friends and neighbors, and to spend an evening out. They watch the game and talk, but the conversations are not always about the game. There is more to life than baseball, but at the ballpark, the conversations are real, people talk about their jobs, their families, and their neighborhood. Baseball brings people together.\n\nMike Trout is the best baseball player in the American League, but that is not the reason he is the best player in the world. He is the best player in the world because he is a great human being. He is the best player in the world because he is a hero to so many, because he represents the best of what is possible for us all. He is not only a star baseball player, but a role model for all of us.\n\nTrout is a great player, but he is a better man.\n\nMike Trout is the greatest human being I have ever known. I have been writing about Mike Trout since his rookie season, and I have never written a story or said a single word about him that was not true. I am proud of that fact. Mike Trout does not need me to say nice things about him, and I have never needed to say anything nice about Mike Trout.\n\nMy job is not to make Mike Trout a hero, it is to tell you about the hero who lives among us, and the hero is Mike Trout.<|endoftext|>Our team has created a new range of fragrances using the most premium essential oils and absolutes.\n\nYou can get all of our products in our webshop or at our offices in Frankfurt or Hannover.\n\nWe deliver to Germany and Europe.

Corporate management likes to show their support for employees and the corporate culture with high-touch programs such as volunteering and family events. These are great things, but have the potential to be overlooked because of the distractions that can be caused by the lack of QA/QC.\n\nSome people have had a very positive experience in corporate employment. They will tell you about the great training and career advancement opportunities that they received. They may even tell you about the great coworkers they had or the nice people that they met. These people are great ambassadors for the company and the corporate environment as a whole.\n\nThese same people will also tell you about a “one bad apple” scenario that they have encountered. This situation may have started with the “one bad apple” performing actions outside of their job scope that could harm others or be harmful to the company’s reputation. It could also be a situation where a manager treated a good employee poorly, causing them to go back and rethink their career goals.\n\nAs an employer, it is a great idea to seek out the “good” employees to promote to higher positions. They can provide the best training opportunities, share their positive experience, and encourage the growth of the company. However, it is just as important to seek out the “bad” employees. These people can shed light on what not to do, provide tips on what works well, and help point out problems that might be encountered later on.\n\nA lot of this can be done during exit interviews. These are opportunities to find out why the employee is leaving. I have always heard that companies like to have two exit interviews: one to find out why they are leaving and one to find out what it will take to get them to stay. I have never worked for a company that did this, but it would be great to see how well it worked.\n\nAnother great way to get honest feedback is to survey the employees anonymously. It is a great idea to let the employee know that their feedback is anonymous, but it is important to let them know that there is a potential that the feedback will be used in management decisions. I always thought it was weird when a manager would say “that feedback was very helpful.” I always wondered if that feedback was used and how much of it was used.\n\nIt is important to realize that quality assurance is important in all aspects of life, not just corporate work. I have had good and bad experiences in the corporate world. But, I have also had good and bad experiences in the corporate world. One of my favorite quotes is “don’t stop thinking about tomorrow,” so I would like to share some thoughts on my past corporate experience.\n\nThese are just my opinions and I am sure other people have had different experiences. Feel free to share your experiences below.\n\nThings to Think About Before You Become an Employee\n\n1. Don’t assume you have any special abilities just because you were promoted. If you are promoted to a new position, you need to realize that you are new to the responsibilities of that position.\n\n2. Take everything with a grain of salt. The people that you work with and the manager that you have are going to play a huge role in your work experience. If you have a bad manager, you need to do your best to work well with him/her and not hold a grudge.\n\n3. Learn to deal with different personalities. Sometimes, this can be a huge issue. If your personality and someone else’s personality clash, you are going to have a bad work experience.\n\n4. Be a good listener. If you hear something that is a problem, write it down and figure out a way to fix it.\n\n5. Don’t take everything personally. You are going to get bad feedback on occasion, so make sure that you don’t take it to heart.\n\n6. Take care of yourself and your body. You need to make sure that you take time to exercise and eat healthy food. People who take care of themselves perform better in their jobs and are happier with their lives.\n\n7. Understand that you have a life outside of work. You can’t be at work 24/7, so you need to make sure that you make time for yourself, your family, and your friends.\n\n8. It�"

The U.S. Navy acquired her on 16 April 1942 for use as a patrol yacht during World War II. She was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, on 30 April 1942 as USS \"Tourmaline\" (PYc-11).\n\n\"Tourmaline\" departed Boston on 14 May 1942 for Casco Bay, Maine, for shakedown training. She then proceeded to New York City, New York, and there reported to Commander, East Coast Patrol, for duty. On 6 June 1942 she got underway for her first wartime patrol, operating out of Argentia, Newfoundland, in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\"Tourmaline\" returned to Boston, Massachusetts, on 4 July 1942. From then through 1944, with the exception of a two-month period in 1943, she made regular, extended patrols in the North Atlantic out of Argentia. On 2 July 1944, while operating out of Argentia in waters off the coast of Greenland, she rescued the crew of a Navy PBM Mariner that had gone down during an anti-submarine patrol. On 25 October 1944 she went to the aid of the Army transport USAT \"Logan Victory\" which had been torpedoed and was sinking in the North Atlantic, ultimately rescuing 77 survivors.\n\nOn 2 March 1945 \"Tourmaline\" was redesignated PY-10. On 10 June 1945 she departed Argentia for her last wartime patrol. Following her return to the United States she was decommissioned at the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 15 September 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 11 October 1946, and she was sold to \"Patapsco Scrap Co., Inc.\" on 15 May 1947.\n\n<|endoftext|>Maggie Langrick\n\nMargaret \"Maggie\" Langrick is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who was the Member of the Scottish Parliament for Galloway and West Dumfries until her resignation on 13 December 2018.\n\nShe is a local councillor, having been a Councillor in Dumfries and Galloway since May 2007, and also was the Cabinet Member for Health and Social Care on Dumfries and Galloway Council until her resignation on 8 March 2018.

It was the first round of the 2014 GP2 season and the first round of the 2014 GP3 season. The race weekend supported the 2014 Austrian Grand Prix.\n\nFor the first time since the 2011 feature race in Istanbul, the GP2 feature race was won by a driver other than Stoffel Vandoorne, who won both races at the Turkish track. Sam Bird, driving for the Russian Time team, won the feature race after taking the lead from polesitter Jolyon Palmer on the first lap. Vandoorne's season-long struggles continued in the sprint race; after starting from the back of the grid he was disqualified for failing to start at the pit lane exit when the safety car peeled into the pit lane. This resulted in Marcus Ericsson winning the sprint race from the pole, his first win in GP2 and the first for his new team, Rapax.\n\nSébastien Buemi won the first GP3 race, the first of his career, for ART Grand Prix. He led teammate George Russell to give the team its first 1–2 finish since the 2013 Italian Grand Prix. Esteban Ocon took his second victory of the season for Prema Powerteam in the sprint race, in which only 18 drivers finished the race after an accident involving Konstantin Tereshchenko resulted in two red flags.\n\nIn the week before the event, James Calado announced that he would be driving for Racing Engineering in the feature race and Trident in the sprint race, replacing Davide Valsecchi at the former team and Johnny Cecotto at the latter. Sean Gelael, who had raced for Carlin at the season-opening 2014 Bahrain GP2 Series round, joined MP Motorsport for the feature race, replacing Tom Dillmann. Alexander Rossi, who drove for Marussia F1 Team at the 2014 Australian Grand Prix, drove for Campos Racing in place of Takuya Izawa. ART Grand Prix announced that Raffaele Marciello, the 2013 Formula Three Euro Series champion, would drive for the team, replacing James Calado in the first race and the third race.\n\nOnly 18 cars finished the feature race after an accident involving Konstantin Tereshchenko for Hilmer Motorsport, who was trying to pass Jack Harvey's Carlin car under braking for the first corner after the start of the second lap, which was followed by two red flags.

"By Beth Duff-Brown, Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK -- President Barack Obama is defending the government's massive phone record collection program as a critical tool against terrorism, saying Americans don't have to sacrifice their privacy in order to be safe.\n\nIn a series of interviews on Monday, Obama sought to assure Americans concerned about the National Security Agency's surveillance efforts that the programs are overseen by federal judges and authorized by Congress. The disclosures by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden last week raised alarms that the government is collecting data on millions of U.S. citizens.\n\nIn a taped interview with NBC's \"Rock Center,\" the president sought to reassure the public.\n\n\"I am comfortable that the program currently is not being abused,\" Obama said. \"I'm comfortable that if the American people examined exactly what was taking place, how it was being used, what the safeguards were, that they would say, 'You know what? These folks are following the law and doing what they say they're doing.'\"\n\nHe added: \"It's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society.\"\n\nObama also discussed the programs in an interview with Telemundo and in an online question-and-answer session on Facebook.\n\nObama insisted that he is not just a bystander to the NSA. He said he is confident that the agency is not engaging in domestic surveillance and is not spying on members of Congress or the news media. He said he had stepped in to make changes at the agency when it wandered off course.\n\n\"I've taken the view, very publicly, that with the changes we made, and the particular situation we find ourselves in, that they strike the right balance,\" Obama said in the interview with NBC.\n\nObama's national security team has mounted a vigorous public defense of the programs since they were disclosed last week.\n\nOn Monday, the office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the president's chief intelligence adviser, declassified and released three secret U.S. court opinions showing the National Security Agency's interpretation of its authority to collect bulk phone records to combat terrorism.\n\nThe White House also gave some support to one of Snowden's chief arguments. The NSA has used the Patriot Act to collect records on all phone calls in the United States. But the Patriot Act does not apply to American phone records, it only allows for collection of data that are relevant to a terrorism investigation.\n\nStill, Clapper told reporters in a separate briefing that the program is \"not a surveillance program.\" He said it does not allow the targeting of U.S. citizens and is overseen by the courts, Congress and administration officials.\n\nThe revelations have triggered widespread criticism and raised questions about whether the administration has gone too far in its efforts to protect Americans from terrorism. The phone-records program, one of two secret programs that came to light last week, collects the numbers and time stamps of phone calls made in the United States but not their content.\n\nIn his Facebook interview, Obama acknowledged that there had been a lack of public trust on the issue, but he sought to play down the programs' intrusiveness.\n\n\"What you're talking about is somebody who is like a suspect, somebody who may be involved in terrorist activity. When that person's telephone calls are analyzed, the degree of intrusion into the content of those phone calls is reduced dramatically,\" he said.\n\nThe Justice Department said late Monday that its top official for overseeing intelligence investigations, David Cuthbertson, is leaving his position as acting assistant attorney general for the department's national security division.\n\nCuthbertson has been serving as acting principal associate deputy attorney general, a position that is held by a single person. He's been filling in for Mary McCord, who is awaiting Senate confirmation to fill the post permanently.\n\nCuthbertson joined the Justice Department in 2006, and most recently served as principal deputy assistant attorney general for the department's civil division. He has been nominated by Obama to be a judge on the U.S. Court of International Trade.\n\nThe department also announced that Rachel L. Brand, a longtime Justice Department lawyer, will take over as head of the department's Office of Legal Policy.<|endoftext|>Shots were fired at the Tropicana hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip during a pursuit involving a burglary suspect, police said.\n\nPolice were pursuing a burglary suspect who fled in a vehicle from the scene of an armed robbery at a nearby casino. The man was shot by police at Tropicana Avenue and Arville Street.\n\nLas Vegas police Lt. Dan McGrath said the suspect was involved in the armed robbery of the Bellagio casino at about 2:30 a.m.\n\nThe man sped off in a vehicle and hit another vehicle at Tropicana and Arville streets.\n\nOfficers were on foot pursuit with the man and tried to detain him when they heard shots. McGrath said one or more officers shot at the suspect.\n\nThe suspect was wounded and was taken into custody by police, McGrath said.\n\nThe man was taken to University Medical Center. His condition was not immediately known.\n\nThe suspect's name has not been released.\n\nMcGrath said there were no injuries reported from the shooting or the crash.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.<|endoftext|>A review of Peter Dale Scott's \"The American Deep State\"\n\nThe term \"deep state\" has a long history and has been used for various intelligence agencies since 1947, when the Central Intelligence Agency was established. Its focus has been on covert intelligence activities such as assassination, propaganda and the use of organized crime.\n\nThere is a wider context to be taken into account. During the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, most U.S. administrations faced strong opposition from major sections of the intelligence apparatus. The Bay of Pigs fiasco, the assassination attempts on Fidel Castro, the JFK assassination, Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair, 9/11 and the many war mongering incidents since then show that, far from supporting a president, the intelligence community and military are often at odds with the White House. In \"The American Deep State,\" Peter Dale Scott analyses the various actors that make up this \"deep state\" and its deep roots in the history of the United States.\n\nFor Scott, the deep state does not just refer to the intelligence apparatus or to a secret organization but rather to an overlapping network that controls politics and the economy, often supporting the military. For example, members of the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) have worked for the CIA, the National Security Council and in the White House, or else have worked for the Trilateral Commission. Similarly, the major banks, the oil companies, the military-industrial complex and the media work in tandem, even if some are more powerful than others.\n\nAt the center of this spider's web is the super-rich 1%, in collusion with a large portion of the super-elite 10% that owns most of the resources of the United States, whether this be land, companies or stock markets. It is a core oligarchy that is effectively able to govern the United States outside of the sight of the media, since they own the media. It is from this small group of owners of banks and oil companies that this elite derives most of its power. Scott makes a good case in demonstrating that there is a massive cover-up regarding the role of the banks in financing and benefiting from the oil industry, the arms trade and organized crime.\n\nFor the author, the Watergate affair and the JFK assassination marked a watershed. In both cases, the truth is being covered up. The Watergate scandal was orchestrated to bring down Nixon, who refused to go along with the deep state. John Kennedy also stood in the way of the oil companies, the military and the CIA. It is this \"deep state\" that governs the United States. It is important to note that there is no secret group behind the scenes that is pulling the strings of the United States. On the contrary, it is the ruling class as a whole. While some members of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission or the Bilderberg Group do indeed have an influence, these are not secret societies but \"secret societies\" for the public, an \"occult public.\"\n\nThis book will probably not be well-received in the United States since it is based on official documents, the mainstream media and historical documents from various administrations. The author is a professor emeritus of English at the University of California and he is not afraid of the term \"Deep State.\" He is less afraid of challenging the accepted version of the Kennedy assassination than of questioning the 9/11 Commission Report. Scott is also the author of a number of works on the JFK assassination and was one of the first to denounce the official version of 9/11.\n\nThis well-researched book is also a sort of an exposé of a central intelligence apparatus that acts as a sort of secret government, often supporting political extremism, rather than fighting it. Indeed, Scott often emphasizes that a deep state \"has its own agenda, which does not coincide with the civil agenda of a society.\" However, Scott also makes a point of showing the role of this deep state in various coups, conspiracies, assassinations, the war in Vietnam, the opposition to the Civil Rights Movement, the war in Afghanistan, and more recently in the United States in the support for torture, extraordinary renditions, the war in Iraq and the attack on Libya.\n\nThis book provides valuable information and helps us understand the true nature of the state in the United States. If the American public were aware of the true role of the intelligence apparatus and the many wars that it supports, there would be widespread protest. It is important to note"
"Trump Administration Is an Outrage Machine: How to Cope\n\nMaxwell Ryan Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 25, 2018\n\nIn the United States of America, it is not uncommon for the government to deny requests for records using dubious legal arguments, redact information at random, or otherwise ignore freedom of information laws and court orders. But during the first six months of the Trump administration, the outrage machine has been working overtime.\n\nLast week, the Department of Justice (DOJ) argued that the release of any information about a detained immigrant’s future would compromise national security. In April, the DOJ refused to release information about which specific, ongoing investigations the FBI has into potential meddling by foreign governments into the U.S. election system. Before that, the DOJ redacted a memo that offered advice on how the Department should respond to a congressional request for information related to the infamous Trump-Russia dossier. And it goes on and on.\n\nEven for the most dedicated observer of U.S. government, it can be difficult to keep track of all the stories and the many denials. But how can you, an average citizen, determine what’s a scandal, what’s a legal argument, and what’s a bit of both?\n\nIf you are interested in understanding how the government is reacting to new information, then you can do no better than the National Security Archive’s Trump-Russia project, a crowdsourced repository for all the documents and information that we as a country can learn about the many aspects of this developing story. If you are looking to get a handle on the scale of the problems, this page is a great place to start. But don’t forget to come back! This is an ongoing project that will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\nWhile the National Security Archive is committed to providing the public with as much information as possible, we know that the U.S. government is just as committed to denying information or obstructing the release of records. In the coming months, the Archive will be continuing to file lawsuits and pressing the administration for the release of information, but that can only go so far.\n\nOur democratic institutions are designed to hold government accountable, and that can only happen if you speak out. Reach out to your elected officials, join organizations that support transparency, and get to know your FOIA laws.<|endoftext|>We ship to all 50 states, all APO/FPO addresses, U.S. territories, and some international locations.\n\nStandard orders typically ship within 1-2 business days.

Oftentimes patients will be seen by multiple practitioners with limited resolution of their symptoms. The knee is one of the most complicated joints in the body and can be affected by multiple structures. These include the bones, tendons, ligaments, menisci, nerves, muscles, and other soft tissue structures. Often times, the specific cause of pain cannot be determined and is referred to as “nonspecific” or “overuse” knee pain. Most often, there is no single lesion that can be directly attributed to the patient’s symptoms. A thorough clinical evaluation is needed to adequately determine the underlying cause of the patient’s symptoms.\n\nMy article in the May 2014 issue of The Physician and Sports Medicine has an update on the evaluation of patellofemoral pain and tibial stress syndrome. I have also included some up to date information on differential diagnosis and appropriate management of common knee conditions such as patellofemoral pain, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and tibial stress syndrome.

"Tuesday, November 19, 2016\n\nAs we approach Thanksgiving, the political temperature in the US is rising and we are beginning to see significant protest movements in a number of states against the incoming President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nSuch protest activity is relatively commonplace in the US and is not surprising given that some of the proposed policy positions that Mr. Trump has put forward, such as building a wall on the border with Mexico or restricting immigration from some countries, are controversial. What is more surprising, and more disturbing, is the number of hate incidents that are being reported across the country, especially in the last two weeks.\n\nIn many ways these hate incidents are similar to what we have seen after other elections and in some cases there are clear political connections. For example, when a KKK rally took place in South Carolina a week after the election, a group of students began marching with them. Similarly, at a University of Mississippi protest, a former mayor was on hand with the KKK to support the protesters and he was later charged with assaulting a student reporter.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing hate incident to date occurred in New York on Friday. In the days after the election, a private Facebook group titled “Torch the City,” which included over 3,000 members, had called for a rally on the streets of the city on the following day. The rally was to start at a subway station on the West Side of Manhattan and then proceed to Trump Tower. “Fascist President-Elect Donald Trump” and “Kill Trump” posters were among the statements on the Facebook page.\n\nThere were reports that some people at the rally were armed with metal poles and baseball bats. In a video posted to YouTube, one man is seen making a Nazi salute as he is asked about his anti-Semitic tattoo.\n\nIn the end, the rally appeared to be a damp squib, with about 400 people reportedly in attendance. Nonetheless, its small scale is likely to be overshadowed by the publicity generated by the group and its statements.\n\nThe incident is one of many reported across the country and they are undoubtedly on the increase. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremist organizations and hate crimes, has said that it has received over 200 reports of such incidents since the election. This number includes both individual incidents as well as general expressions of support for the President-elect. The incidents range from personal attacks to acts of property destruction, with particular focus on members of the LGBT community and Muslims.\n\nThere have also been isolated incidents of harassment or violence aimed at African Americans, who are already subject to routine discrimination. For example, on the day after the election, two brothers were attacked and beaten by a group of white men as they walked down the street in Boston, yelling, “You voted Trump”. Also, in Boston, the day after the election, a white man who had verbally abused a Latino man on the bus was attacked by other passengers.\n\nWhile some have condemned the hate incidents, others have defended them as “free speech.” It remains to be seen how the President-elect will react. Mr. Trump had previously spoken out against the supporters of the KKK during his campaign. More recently, he has tweeted a condemnation of hate crime and an assurance to the LGBT community that he will do his best for them. Nevertheless, the rhetoric of his campaign focused on uniting a divided country and he has indicated that he will look to bring people together in his Administration.\n\nWe are only three weeks into this new political world and many more chapters have yet to be written. As always, employers should stay vigilant about potential discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in their workplaces.\n\nRobert M.

These properties are a direct result of the structure of these particles, as well as the number of particles involved in a chemical reaction. An example of this is the net charge on a proton (hydrogen nucleus) and a neutron. These particles can participate in chemical reactions as positively charged particles (protons) or neutral particles (neutrons).\n\nParticles in Chemistry Some of the important charged particles (positively charged particles) in chemistry are listed below. Note that these are just a few of the many charged particles that are found in the nucleus. Nucleus Charge Electron –1 Proton +1 or -1 Neutron 0, +1, or -1\n\nParticles as Either Positively or Negatively Charged Particles A positively charged particle has an excess of protons compared to the number of electrons. A negatively charged particle has an excess of electrons compared to the number of protons. The rest of the charged particles can be either positively or negatively charged depending on the number of protons and electrons that they have. A neutral particle has the same number of protons as electrons. An example of a positively charged particle is a proton. An example of a negatively charged particle is an electron.\n\nNeutral Particles The electrically neutral particles include the proton, neutron, electron, and neutrino. It is the charge on these particles that allows for chemical reactions. For example, in a chemical reaction that involves an electron, an electron is transferred from one atom to another. It is the charge on the electron that causes it to be attracted to the opposite charge of the opposite atom.<|endoftext|>Fried chicken is probably my favorite thing to eat ever. Well, maybe besides waffles. And even though the oil can give me a headache if I smell it, I have yet to meet a fried chicken recipe I didn't like.\n\nBut one thing I have yet to figure out is why fried chicken is so often served as a part of a combo meal at fast food restaurants. Do they want you to try it because it's so delicious, or are they hoping that you'll order it and not want to take the time to study the other menu options?\n\nAnd why isn't it offered as a stand-alone item? A meal at KFC that includes a two-piece chicken meal, three sides, and a large drink, is about $11. A chicken meal with a side, biscuit, and drink is $7.50. Why don't they just cut out the middleman and offer a four-piece meal at the price of a three-piece meal?<|endoftext|>This was our first cruise with Princess. We were very disappointed. Embarkation in Boston was a disaster. The lines were so long and after waiting for over 2 hours, we had to leave to catch our shuttle to the hotel. We had planned on going back to the port after the shuttle and went back the next day to board the ship. When we arrived, the line at check in had shortened to the point that the line was no longer an issue. Our stateroom was ready so we got our room key and went up. The stateroom was not in the best condition. We had trouble with the safe. The smoke detector was covered with paint. The wallpaper was coming off in the stateroom. There was no night light in the bathroom and the toilet seat would not stay up.\n\nThe food was not up to the standard we have seen on other cruise ships. The buffet food was often cold. The only food that was consistently hot was the stir fry station. The food in the dining room was also cold. The same thing happened to the roast beef at both lunch and dinner. The staff at the dining room always seemed to be running around. The food at the grill was great. The hamburger was very good and the cook at the grill was very friendly. The buffet had a small selection and not a very good selection of food. It was difficult to find a place to sit and the coffee bar had a long line.\n\nThe activities were not great. There were only a few scheduled events. We went to the sing and dance competition. The sound system did not work well. The prizes for the competition were very poor and were not even mentioned at the end of the show. We went to the “meet the captain” and it was not worth the time. We went to the pirate show and that was fun. The staff at the casino were not friendly. We had hoped for some gambling lessons from the staff. They did not offer them. We went to the morning exercise class and the instructor, who was very friendly, did not give us any instructions on how to do the exercises. We thought that was really strange. The nightly entertainment was good but a bit sparse. We could have done without the comedian. The singer was great and so was the quartet. The female singer was really great. We were there the night the staff sang Christmas songs and it was a very enjoyable show.\n\nOur cabin attendant was not very friendly and seemed to avoid us when we were at our cabin. We did not get the evening canapes. We received no extra towel animals.\n\nThe ports were very nice but some were rather boring. The people in New York and in New Orleans were not very friendly.\n\nThe cabin was not in the best condition. There were several things broken. The chair on our balcony was broken. The pull cord for the curtain had come out and the curtain was open during the day. We were not aware of that so we sat in the sun a few times. The button on the elevator for the top deck was broken. It said that you had to be on deck 9 to go up to 10 but you could go up to 11.\n\nWe thought that the staff at the end of the cruise, after we had completed the disembarkation survey, were a little more friendly. We were told that we would receive a letter and perhaps a discount on a future cruise. We have not received a letter yet and I don’t"
"They've won Oscars for their music. Now hip-hop stars Common and John Legend will take on acting as well.\n\nThe duo have signed on to star in a comedy pilot that will be directed by Lee Daniels.\n\nThe project is described as a 'hip-hop version of The Odd Couple', and revolves around two best friends, one straight and one gay, who find their friendship at risk as they work to maintain their place at the top of the hip-hop world in the face of unexpected challenges and a changing landscape.\n\nThe roles will be familiar to fans of the artists' music; Common starred in Smokin' Aces and John Legend has starred in Pussycat Dolls: The Search for the Next Doll and Bobby.\n\nThe show is part of Lee Daniels' \"Hollywoodesque\" series, with the pilot also starring Stephen Bishop and LeToya Luckett, and Tom Donaghy as the executive producer.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThe project will be overseen by the same team behind hit TV shows like Nip/Tuck, The O.C., and Gossip Girl.\n\nNo network has signed on to produce the show yet, but filming is set to start next week.<|endoftext|>The It Girl for the Common Man — Samuel Adams’s Boston Lager, and of course the brand’s entire line of beer — is nothing if not ubiquitous. These days it can be found at your favorite watering hole, most chain restaurants and some grocery stores. But Samuel Adams’s new brew in the 22-ounce bomber-size bottle, Triple Bock, is a little different.\n\nIntroduced in 1995 as a strong winter brew, the brand brought the brew back with a vengeance in 2006. Now you can find it everywhere, though often in local craft beer outlets for about $10 or $12 a bottle.\n\nWith a whopping 18 percent ABV, Triple Bock is not exactly what you’d call a session beer. That’s fine, though, since its flavor is so well-balanced that it can stand up to even the most robust food.\n\nSo what’s in this beer that makes it so strong? There are, after all, only six ingredients: malted barley, hops, water, yeast, caramel malt and roasted malt. And of course alcohol itself. And yet, it’s the balance of all of these elements that makes it stand out.\n\nThe first time I tasted it was about five years ago, and it was quite nice. This time, however, I was a bit disappointed, though still willing to drink it. It was good — very good, in fact — but somehow I found the beer a bit flat and uninteresting. It wasn’t quite what I was hoping for.\n\nIs it still worth it? Definitely. At a mere $10 to $12 a bottle, it’s a great choice for an after-dinner drink, or maybe as an alternative for a low-alcohol beer (this would be a great choice for an alcohol-sensitive friend at a party). It’s strong, it’s full-bodied, and it’s a nice change of pace.<|endoftext|>Lunch at Boogaloo, it's the word on the street. If you are seeking something special with an exceptional view, then this is the place to go.\n\nIt’s located in the heights, with an amazing view of downtown and the James River. They have a great happy hour with free bites to nibble on while you wait for your table. They have the bar seating with a great view of the view and if you're lucky enough to have a larger party they have a great upper deck with a view of downtown and the James.\n\nI had the calamari and fried green tomatoes which were both delicious. Our meal was delicious and fresh and the service was impeccable. Definitely a must if you are seeking a nice place to eat in Richmond.<|endoftext|>r/TF2: Team Fortress 2 community. Valve Corporation.

Sometimes it is just someone being real and authentic, not faking it. It could be just that they are not always perfect but are so honest about it. It can also be that they have real insecurities but embrace them and work on them. It could be that they are not the “cool kid” but they are honest and cool. It can also be that they are brave and strong enough to talk about things that they have been through.\n\nGrowing up, I was always really insecure. I was a pretty shy, quiet kid and very self-conscious. Although I was insecure and was not confident, I wanted to change and was not going to let it define me. I am a teenager now and have grown to love myself. I am still working on my confidence, but it is a work in progress. I used to be very self-conscious about my nose and my smile, but I’m okay with it now. I realized that even though people make fun of me for it, that doesn’t mean that I have to be insecure about it. Now, I embrace the fact that I have a different nose, and I’m okay with it. I am also okay with my smile, even though people think I have a “nerd” smile, because it makes me unique.\n\nWhen I think about celebrities, I think of the times that they have been able to grow through something and then talk about it. It’s okay if you are insecure. It’s okay if you are imperfect, because we all are. If you are honest and just be real about it, that’s when people will really gravitate towards you and be inspired by you. There is no such thing as being perfect or cool.\n\nHere are a few examples of celebrities who are amazing, imperfect people who are real and honest:\n\nMillie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things)\n\nMillie Bobby Brown has been open about how she is an introvert and was not always very confident. I love how she has opened up about her insecurities and her work ethic. She has not been afraid to be imperfect and honest about it. She is not afraid to talk about her struggles, which I think is amazing. I think it is so important to talk about things and not be afraid of being imperfect.\n\nGigi Gorgeous (YouTube)\n\nGigi Gorgeous is an amazing, brave and strong person. I know that there are so many transgender people who struggle, and she has not been afraid to be honest about her story. She is not perfect and has made mistakes. But, she is not afraid to be imperfect, which I think is amazing.\n\nHayley Williams (Paramore)\n\nHayley Williams is an amazing artist who is so honest and real. She is not afraid to be imperfect, which I think is amazing. She is also honest about her anxiety and other insecurities. She is not afraid to be open about the fact that she has been bullied.\n\nJoey Graceffa (YouTube)\n\nJoey Graceffa is also another brave and honest person. He is not afraid to talk about his struggles, his mental health and other things. He has also been able to talk about how he has had to face bullying. He is brave and honest and has not been afraid to talk about it, which I think is so important.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it is so important that we talk about things, because we are not perfect. I think it is also so important to be brave and strong and be honest and open about it. People gravitate towards people who are real and honest, because they are not afraid to be imperfect. I think that it is also important to know your worth and to be kind to yourself, because we are all beautiful in our own way.<|endoftext|>So I need some help with a much larger project.

"UNAFF\n\nUnited Nations Office for Partnerships\n\nUNAFF is a partnership between UNESCO and the United Nations. It aims to promote educational, scientific and cultural co-operation between countries.\n\nUNESCO was created to provide leadership in the field of culture, science, education and communication. UNAFF seeks to find the best way to harness the organization's efforts in order to promote the well-being of humankind.\n\nUNAFF's mission is to build global networks of partnerships to maximize the potential of the United Nations system. The UNAFF staff acts as a catalyst for partnerships between UN organizations and others who share an interest in education, culture, science and communication. The UNAFF office is located in New York City, and staff visits offices and missions around the world to help facilitate the partnerships they seek to create.\n\nA partnership is an association based on a set of agreements and shared objectives between two or more independent organizations. Partnerships may be long-term, short-term, formal or informal, or may even lack all of these elements. However, they must be based on some shared element, such as common goals or resources. A partnership will generally be constituted by contracts between the partners, and sometimes even by laws passed by the partners. Partnerships often involve more than two parties, and partnerships with many participants may be highly complex, such as a joint venture.\n\nSome partnerships are termed \"loose\" and are created by only an exchange of information, such as by sharing ideas between academic researchers or by the sharing of interests between firms. Others are termed \"tight\" and are created by legal contracts.\n\nIn some partnerships, the creation of an organization is the desired outcome, while others will be created in order to achieve specific objectives.\n\nWhile partnerships can be and are created to achieve an enormous range of objectives, they can be categorized based on their purpose and the extent of the commitment involved.\n\nSome common types of partnerships include:\n\nThese are partnerships that share a wide variety of resources, such as between a business and its supplier or a university and its students. These partnerships are often not formal, and the extent of sharing of resources can range from very open to very closed. These partnerships tend to be more fluid and easily created and broken.\n\nThese are organizations which have been created to achieve a specific shared objective, and as such often involve long-term commitments and the pooling of resources. Some common examples of these are charitable organizations, clubs, and other associations. These partnerships are often long-term, but the resource pooling will tend to be less complete than in the other forms.\n\nThese are partnerships which have been created to achieve a common objective. While these often result in the creation of a new organization, they do not have to. Some of these partnerships are undertaken to achieve a specific goal. These are the most common partnerships, and can range from a wide variety of forms.\n\nIn order to create a partnership, partners must first identify the following:\n\nPartnership types may also require specific partners:\n\nBecause partnerships can take a wide variety of forms, with widely varying levels of resource pooling, it can be hard to define what an organization is, and even harder to define a partnership. However, one useful way to describe an organization is as a partnership of organizations.\n\nA partnership is typically defined as a relationship between two or more independent organizations that is based on shared objectives, and involves some level of resource pooling. As a partnership, each organization in the relationship shares decision-making authority with other partners in the relationship.\n\nMany partnerships involve long-term commitments. However, they can be as short-term as the common agreement between two people who decide to meet for lunch, to the long-term commitment between members of a religious order. However, a long-term commitment may be desired because the resources being pooled will be shared for a long time.\n\nWhile partnerships are often the result of long-term commitments, some partners will wish to enter into more short-term relationships. Many partnerships, such as those between religious orders, are essentially long-term commitments, but in many of these cases there are temporary partners, such as the members of a temporary monastic order or the people who participate in a retreat.\n\nIt is important that each partner is fully informed of the agreement before entering into a partnership. If this is not done, then partners can come to feel deceived if they are not kept informed. This can lead to the failure of the partnership.\n\nMost partnerships have a shared set of objectives. These will typically be defined by the partners. The partnership may then be created in order to achieve these objectives. It is important to note that a lack of clarity on these objectives will cause the partnership to be less effective, and the lack of these objectives can cause the partnership to fail.\n\nMany partnerships also require that some resources be pooled between partners. The resources which are pooled will depend on the objective of the partnership. If the partners have created a shared organization, then some of the shared resources may be those of the organization. In the case of partnerships to achieve a specific objective, the resources may be less tangible.\n\nSome resources which are commonly pooled between partners are:\n\nPartnerships can be terminated in a number of ways. If a partnership is intended to be long-term, this can be achieved by either of the partners. However, if the partnership is only intended to achieve a specific goal, then it can only be terminated when that goal has been achieved.\n\nPartnerships can also end when the partners cannot come to an agreement on something. For example, when a company and its suppliers cannot come to an agreement on the price of a product, they may decide to terminate the partnership.\n\nIn order for partners to have a successful partnership, they must be able to communicate effectively. Effective communication can take many forms, from simply keeping each other informed of progress to a detailed exchange of plans and resources.\n\nIf communication is not effective, the partners will not be able to coordinate their actions. This can cause the partnership to fail, as well as create conflict between the partners. This can also lead to the partners trying to achieve the same goals by different means, which may also lead to failure.\n\nIt is important for each partner to understand the others' culture, as this will be a major influence on the actions that each of them take.\n\nA number of problems can arise in a partnership, and many are common to all partnerships.\n\nConflict is a common problem in any type of partnership. If partners are not communicating, then they may end up in conflict because they are pursuing different goals. Conflict can also arise if partners are pursuing the same goal but are taking different approaches to achieve this goal.\n\nConflict can lead to a number of other problems in a partnership. It can cause partners to become distracted from the original objective. It can also lead to damage to the relationship between partners, or even to the termination of the partnership.\n\nConflict may also arise due to distrust. This may be caused by a lack of communication. If a partner is unsure of the motives of another partner, they may believe that the other partner has an ulterior motive.\n\nThis is a type of trust conflict which can arise between partners. If partners believe that they will not receive what they have been promised, then they will not trust the other partner.\n\nConflict between partners can cause each to take action which does not serve the partnership well. This can include both partners taking more or less than they should of a resource. It can also cause partners to take other actions which damage the partnership.\n\nA lack of communication can cause conflict, as described above. This is common in partnerships which are not well planned or well organized. However, this may not cause conflict.\n\nWhile conflict is usually viewed as a negative event, this need not be the case. Conflict between partners can also lead to greater collaboration. For example, if two partners have conflicting views, they may come to a better conclusion if they discuss the differences. This can help them understand each other's point of view. This process may also lead them to agree on an objective that is better than either would have developed alone.\n\nIn many partnerships, partners will take actions which affect the other partners. These may be either intended or unintended.\n\nIf a partner takes an action which negatively affects another partner, this can cause problems in the partnership. In some cases, this may be deliberate. For example, a partner may take an action which causes another partner to suffer a loss.\n\nIn other cases, this may be an unintentional side-effect of a partner's actions. For example, a partner may open a business in a location where a competitor already has a shop.\n\nA partner who takes an action which affects another partner, but does not have the other partner's best interests in mind may be said to have acted in bad faith.\n\nA partner who fails to understand the concerns of another partner may be said to have acted in bad faith. For example, if a company closes a factory, and its workers are upset because of this, the company may not have understood that it was the workers who would be affected.\n\nConflicts of interest are a specific type of action which is intended to benefit one partner at the expense of another. These can be very specific, such as the use of one partner's resources by another partner without permission.\n\nIn other cases, conflicts of interest can be much more subtle, such as when a partner proposes a goal for a partnership that may not benefit all partners.\n\nConflicts of interest can be addressed by ensuring that the partners in a partnership share the same objectives, and also by ensuring that each partner receives something. If a partner is providing resources to the partnership, then the other partners should ensure that they receive something of value in return. If"

One of those changes is the Start menu. It was a big change, but not all of the changes were met with open arms. For those of us who are fans of Classic Shell, this is something we have to deal with. This tutorial shows you how to remove the OneDrive placeholder from the Windows 10 Start menu.\n\nPlease note that this tutorial will be using a desktop method, but the start menu itself will be the same.\n\nRemove OneDrive from the Windows 10 Start menu\n\nLet’s get started by creating a new folder in our start menu. Click on the Start button and select “All Apps”. This should open up your start menu and display all of your installed programs. Scroll down to the bottom and right-click in an empty space. This should bring up a context menu with an option to create a new folder. Select that option. You should now see the folder.\n\nWe are going to be renaming the folder to make it easier to identify. Click on the name and rename it to “OneDrive”. Right click the folder and select “Properties”. In the properties dialog, select the “Customize” option. This will bring up a dialog box. Select “Clear” to remove the placeholder text.\n\nThat’s it. Once you do that, your OneDrive placeholder should be removed. If you don’t like it that way, you can always re-enable it. I know there are some people who do like the placeholder, but if you’re not using it, why have it there?\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER<|endoftext|>Today I decided to go back to the bickie chair and finish it. I already painted the wood frame and today I will go back and give it some personality. I used this tutorial from Blackbird Blogs . I liked the paint swatch approach, but since this is a sewing bickie chair, I wanted to put some pink in it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing I did was to find a few of the pink fabrics that I like to make some swatches.\n\nThe second thing I did was to decide where I wanted them to be placed and if I wanted them to be small or large, or big. I also wanted to decide if I wanted them to be placed in a diagonal direction.\n\nSo I thought this would be a good size and place.\n\nThe first thing I did was to paint some blue paint on the white frame. Then I cut some scrap fabrics and used the same blue to paint them. I think they are looking pretty good.\n\nI took out a piece of the fabric that I want to use on the seat cushion.\n\nI then laid out the pink pieces on top of the fabric. I used some extra fabrics to line up the pieces that I want to use for the seat cushion. I then glued them down.\n\nI painted over the pink fabric pieces.\n\nI then glued some leftover fabrics on the front of the seat to hide the part that goes down inside of the bickie.\n\nI will come back and cut the piece of the seat to fit when I put the actual seat cushion in.\n\nI then took a ruler and cut down the left side of the fabric and then glued it down.\n\nI am really liking how it is looking so far.\n\nI then painted the bottom of the fabric pieces. I then glued them to the bottom of the bickie chair.\n\nNow I have all of the fabrics on the seat cushion.\n\nNext, I took some extra pink fabric and covered the back of the bickie chair.\n\nI just used a glue stick to stick it down.\n\nNow it looks like it is really coming together.\n\nI also wanted to add some fabric to the back of the bickie chair to hide the rest of the screws. I used some scrap fabric that I had left over from my sewing project.\n\nI used a glue gun to glue the fabric on the back of the chair.\n\nI then added some fabric to the bottom of the bickie chair. I used the same scrap fabric that I had just used on the back of the bickie chair. I used a glue gun to glue it on the bottom of the bickie chair.\n\nNow it is all finished and it looks great! I really like how it turned out.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am really glad I decided to do this. It was not very difficult and it is a great way to add some color to my home.\n\nI will leave you with a couple of pictures.\n\nThanks for stopping by today!\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Jan 23, 2013\n\n\"I have been having this pain for about 4 days now.

And that November, the people chose a newcomer, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León, as their president. The people had a choice. They could have decided that the government was a mess and the country needed a different leader. But that's not what they did.\n\nIn recent weeks, many people in the United States have been expressing concern over what's happening in their country. Many are asking, \"What are we going to do about it?\" Many people believe that our government and our nation are in trouble. But I don't believe that the problem is our government or our nation. The problem is us. We have a choice.\n\nIn the United States, there are roughly 31,000 churches of various denominations. (The numbers can vary depending on the statistics you read.) In order for these churches to maintain their tax-exempt status, they must file what is known as Form 1023. The information gathered on this form tells the government how many people attend each church, what their ethnic backgrounds are, and what kinds of programs they have to minister to the community. In one sense, churches that file this form aren't supposed to be doing so in order to gain tax breaks. They do so so that they can receive more grant money from the government. The government is using churches to bring \"services\" to the community, because the government can't seem to do it themselves.\n\nIt's interesting that churches are required to file this information, but the government isn't required to report their own numbers. In fact, I can't find anywhere where the government is even required to report its own statistics. I can't even find out how many people are employed by the government, and who they are. The U.S. government is the largest employer in the world, but they aren't required to report their own statistics.\n\nIf we as a nation want to see a change, we have to make a choice. We have to choose to tell the government what they should be doing. We have to make a choice to report our own statistics.\n\nI remember when the National Church Council asked us to write letters to Congress asking for increased funding to the Corporation for National and Community Service. The church received a total of 45 letters. 45 letters. From nearly 2,000 people. I can't even begin to fathom what 45 letters would do to Congress.\n\nWe have to make a choice.\n\nJesus said, \"As a man thinks in his heart, so is he\" (Proverbs 23:7). The people of Mexico had a choice. They could have said, \"We have to fix the problem in our government.\" But they chose to fix the problem in their own hearts. That's the same choice that we have to make today.\n\nSo we have a choice. Let's make the right one.\n\nMike<|endoftext|>To właśnie Polak - Marcin Karolewski uczestniczył w tegorocznej edycji etapu wspinaczkowego w Himalajach (Nepal). Start odbył się w Dhampus.

"Look, when the playoffs begin, it is entirely about winning and winning only. Nothing else.\n\nNothing about trying to make a name for yourself, nothing about showing off your hard work, nothing about proving yourself to anybody. Nothing about personal glory, nothing about satisfaction. You get the glory if you win, or the blame if you lose.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. The desire to win and the desire to get personal satisfaction from your work are not mutually exclusive. In fact, you can have both and sometimes you need both to win.\n\nBut you can’t start thinking about that before you even get to the playoffs, you need to be purely focused on the business of winning the games and winning the series.\n\nNow, if you’re John Gibson, of course you want to win and you want to prove to everybody how good you are, but you can’t win if you’re injured, and you can’t prove to everybody if you’re injured.\n\nSometimes you need to accept your role and step aside, no matter how much you want to win.\n\nI get the feeling this is the approach the Ducks are taking with John Gibson. I don’t know if he is happy about it, I don’t know if he wants to be the best goalie in the league, but at this point, it’s more important for him to be healthy.\n\nBecause, for me, you can’t make the argument for the best goalie in the league when you have played only one game in five months. You just can’t.\n\nGibson isn’t an unknown, he is not a young goalie trying to prove himself, he has already done that.\n\nIf you are the team’s best goalie, you play. But the team also needs to be careful that they don’t go down that road again, with another young goalie, and another season derailed.\n\nThe trade deadline is fast approaching and the Ducks have the potential to acquire an upgrade at goalie, should they choose to do so. The Ducks have options.\n\nBut they also have a need. Cam Fowler is out for at least the next two months, and nobody knows when Kevin Bieksa will be back.\n\nIf the Ducks trade for a goalie and the goalie gets hurt, that could be a problem. It could be a problem in a different way if Gibson gets hurt.\n\nThe Ducks need to keep themselves as healthy as possible for the playoffs. And this might mean Gibson doesn’t get a chance to play at all in the regular season.\n\nThis could mean the Ducks bring back Jonathan Bernier. They are paying him more than $4 million to not play, but they don’t have a better option. Or they bring back Anton Khudobin.\n\nThis also means that, if the Ducks choose to go with John Gibson and he gets hurt, they are in a lot of trouble. The backup would need to be perfect.\n\nSo this is what I propose: The Ducks should start Bernier in at least 10 games, Khudobin in at least 10 games and Gibson in at least 10 games.\n\nBernier might be too expensive to play, and Khudobin might be too bad to play, but Gibson deserves a chance to prove himself. And if he doesn’t play, he’s not going to prove anything.\n\nBernier might be playing for his next contract, Khudobin might be playing to prove he’s still a viable backup, and Gibson might be playing to prove he’s still an elite goalie.\n\nBut if the Ducks can’t win with Gibson, they can’t win with anyone.<|endoftext|>This cake is definitely going to be a crowd pleaser.

"About half of consumers claim to have sent or received texts or email messages while driving, according to a survey released Monday.\n\nThe National Safety Council also found that more than one-third of drivers said they read text messages or email, sent them, or answered them while driving.\n\n“It’s distressing that a growing number of motorists are engaged in these potentially distracting activities while behind the wheel,” said Janet Froetscher, president and CEO of the National Safety Council. “However, the good news is that the majority are not, and we believe this is due to the educational efforts of groups like the NSC.”\n\nThe group said it conducted its survey in the third quarter of 2010 among 2,100 adults and found that 9 percent of respondents said they had sent a text message while driving and 14 percent said they had read one. Thirteen percent of drivers said they had sent email, and 19 percent said they had read an email.\n\nNearly one-third said they had answered a phone call or voicemail while driving.\n\nThe National Safety Council advocates for legislation to ban the use of mobile devices while driving. The group’s new survey comes as several states have considered such bills, including New York, which earlier this month passed a law barring drivers from texting and emailing.\n\nThe issue of texting while driving has also been the subject of a campaign by AT&T, the parent company of CNN.<|endoftext|>The Alien Elite version is what every Alienware buyer is always clamoring for. Of course, it will cost a little more than the standard.\n\nCNET Reviews has reviewed the Alienware M17x gaming laptop. \"As with all Alienware gaming laptops, the high-end version of the M17x costs about as much as an Xbox 360. However, it also delivers some of the most impressive gaming performance we've ever seen on a laptop, and that makes it worth a look for gamers who can afford it. At a more reasonable price, we'd also recommend the standard version for people looking for the ultimate 17-inch gaming laptop, but we feel the higher-end configuration is a must for anyone looking for a real gaming experience.\"\n\n\"The Alienware M17x is a high-end 17-inch gaming laptop that's best suited for those who don't mind spending a lot of money for the best hardware available. If you're just looking for a machine that will let you play games at a decent frame rate, you can find better options elsewhere.\" -- By Erik Sofge, CNET Reviews.\n\nRead the full review here.\n\nContact sales@alienware.com for more information.<|endoftext|>Tobias Neumark\n\nTobias Neumark’s abstract paintings explore the relationship between the inner and outer worlds of the psyche and between a virtual and a physical space. He works with a process of painting that he describes as a sort of movement through space, which plays a crucial role in defining his works’ structure.\n\n\n\nNeumark’s works on canvas depict dark surfaces with subtle optical shifts. The fields and landscapes in his paintings exist in an altered reality, a fictional space that is both real and unreal. These two worlds merge in his paintings, creating a mirror image of space and time.\n\n\n\nNeumark’s painting process is also very much defined by the physical structure of his canvases, which often begin with a white ground on which the composition of the painting will be built. Neumark works with ‘forms’ – using the geometry of colours to create a composition with rhythm, based on an expressive dynamic, through abstract forms that are both figurative and abstract.\n\n\n\nHis use of colour is not accidental; for Neumark, the colour has a ‘psycho-physiological’ effect on the viewer. These works aim to suggest movement, as the subject appears in a number of different forms and states of being, depicting both inner and outer spaces.<|endoftext|>President Obama’s pledge to double the size of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, whose loans are the key means of stimulating exports for U.S. firms, is in deep trouble.\n\nWith a majority of Senate Republicans already lining up in opposition to its expansion, the most important champion of the bank in Congress has come out against it. In a statement Friday, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) said he would oppose an increase in the bank’s lending limit without reforms to make it more transparent.\n\nHensarling is the author of a controversial proposal that would overhaul the bank’s funding model by replacing its current direct line of government-backed credit with a mechanism more in line with how private banks operate. Though his plan has won bipartisan support in the past, the White House has repeatedly refused to endorse it.\n\n“As a result,” Hensarling said Friday, “I will not support the president’s requested two-year extension of the Ex-Im Bank’s charter unless and until the House adopts the Financial Services Committee’s recommended reforms.”\n\nHensarling’s decision is a serious setback for the White House, which is eager to use the bank as a tool for fighting global warming by encouraging U.S. firms to export climate-friendly goods like solar panels and wind turbines to developing countries.\n\nIt also raises the stakes for the larger debate over free trade, which is set to heat up this spring as Obama makes his push for a free-trade deal with Europe.\n\n“As one of the top ten exports destinations for U.S. goods, the U.K. should be front and center in the president’s push to double exports,” Christopher Wenk, head of the U.S. international trade association representing European companies, told The Guardian.\n\nAfter a series of political setbacks, the White House is running out of time to get its way on trade.\n\nLast week, after a planned vote on a fast-track trade bill was postponed in the House, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) warning him that Democrats would oppose a trade bill until they received assurance from him that he would allow an amendment on a controversial abortion funding measure.\n\nHouse Democrats have been demanding such an amendment for years, but have previously agreed to delay it in exchange for Republican votes on trade bills. But in the wake of a flood of bad headlines for the Export-Import Bank, that bargain has fallen apart.<|endoftext|>Although this paper states that the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision-making model is expected to result in an increase in inflation, the model actually has no direct effect on the price level or on aggregate demand. Inflation and the price level are end-points of the aggregate demand curve, so in a model of the aggregate demand curve and its movements, the Reserve Bank's policy will have an effect on the level of inflation. This paper also says that the Australian inflation rate is more sensitive to unemployment than to the interest rate, but the opposite is true in the UK.<|endoftext|>A new \"Star Trek\" television series is set to premiere in January 2017 on CBS, and the search for a new Enterprise captain is underway.\n\nInterested in Star Trek?

But Netflix has more than 100 million members.\n\nWhile it's certainly interesting to hear that Jolie is being courted for a role, THR didn't have any details on what character she might play.\n\nApple has long wanted to launch its own streaming service, but has faced a number of obstacles.\n\nIt's unclear whether Apple is interested in a fully scripted series, or if the service will also include podcasts.\n\nAnother potential impediment to Apple's streaming service is the cost.\n\nThe executive also is trying to secure a deal with \"This American Life\" host and executive producer Ira Glass. That could create the largest video-subscription service in the world.

The daughters of the 1st Earl of Westmoreland, Isabel and Anne shared a strong affinity with the Pastons. This is evidenced by the presence of John Paston II and John Paston III at the former's wedding to Sir John Fastolf's heir, John Fastolf, and the marriage of Isabel's stepdaughter Margaret Herbert to John Paston II.\n\nAnne and Isabel's conflict with the Duke of Norfolk reached its peak in 1476. That year, William FitzAlan, the 11th Earl of Arundel, died without issue, leaving the bulk of his estates to his widow, Anne, Duchess of Norfolk. However, a clause in the Earl's will made provision for his illegitimate son, Henry FitzAlan. Anne immediately asserted her rights to the FitzAlan estates and sought to deny her husband access to them. On 15 June, the Duke of Norfolk demanded that the Duchess of Norfolk present him with the estate accounts. In response, Anne wrote to her husband's steward, William Gresham, on the 23rd June, reminding him of her ownership of the FitzAlan properties and asserting that her husband was in no position to demand anything from her.\n\nAnne's response to her husband was prompted by her husband's decision to leave court in order to attend to his various estates, during which time he met with his wife. The Duke and Duchess of Norfolk returned to court by July. This letter was sent by Anne in response to her husband's demands, some time after their return.\n\n\n\nLondon\n\nJuly the 27th 1476\n\n\n\n[On a loose piece of paper, now preserved among the Paston Letters, is the following:-\n\n\n\n'My ryght worchepful and most dradd and ryght hartely belovyd husbande, the soth [truth] ys that of ryght and of lawe the I have the maner of Arundell in thes myldren of Arundell [marches] and your steward ys reasenably bysted with me therof, wherfor my most humble and humbyll desyre is to youre noble grace that my fadyr mynde and his will maye be in thes myldren done, for, as for me, I have not, and never had, tytle to no myldren myn, for they be my lordes and to holde thes myldren agaynst his will is bot myche myschyld [mischief].

The question is, can you get enough of the good stuff from your diet alone? And if not, what supplements can you take to keep your gut bacteria happy?\n\nTo find out, we talked to Dr. Robert Zembroski, the Director of Research at Symbiotic Health. Dr. Zembroski also holds a doctorate in Microbiology and Immunology from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and has worked as a clinical microbiologist for the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Zembroski shared the science behind fermented foods and probiotics, as well as the best way to eat and supplement them for optimal gut health.\n\nWhat Is Fermentation?\n\nWe can think of food fermentation as the process of breaking down complex carbohydrates in plant or animal food sources to a simpler, more easily digestible form, says Dr. Zembroski.\n\n“When you have something like cabbage or turnips or beets or wheat, it has a tough cell wall around it. If you chew it up, you’re not going to digest the food inside,” he says. “If you want to get the nutrients out of that food, you’ve got to do something to it that will help you to digest that food.”\n\nFermentation is one of the easiest ways to accomplish that. The process, which can also occur through processes like drying and cooking, breaks down the food source, which makes it easier to digest. The microbes that break down the food source—such as yeasts and bacteria—also produce beneficial enzymes, proteins, vitamins, and other compounds.\n\n“If you ferment the right food in the right way, you’re basically extracting all of the good stuff out of that food. It’s just like when you make juice,” Dr. Zembroski says.\n\nHow Fermented Foods Improve Your Gut Health\n\nWhen the food in your gut is easier to digest, your gut bacteria can better access the food source and produce beneficial compounds like short-chain fatty"
"Marengo Cave\n\nMarengo Cave, sometimes referred to as the \"Cave of the Winds\" is a cave in Marengo, Iowa, United States. The cave is privately owned and operated.\n\nMarengo Cave is a cave system of in length. In total, there are 26 rooms and four connecting passageways. The temperature inside the cave is maintained at 52 degrees year-round.\n\nMarengo Cave was discovered in 1873 when the owner, Stephen Perry, heard sounds coming from it. After digging a hole, Perry broke through to a chamber. He began developing the cave by digging passageways, cutting steps, building a tram, installing lighting, and moving rocks. Perry opened the cave to the public on August 1, 1890.\n\nIn 1901, a local banker named Frank Smith purchased the cave for $4500. He spent the next three years repairing the cave, expanding it, and bringing in artifacts. The cave is named after his wife, a relative of Napoléon Bonaparte.\n\nThe cave was purchased by Robert and Terry Stoeckle in 2005.\n\nIn 2009, Marengo Cave was a stop on the American Caving Accidents Rescue Organization (ACARO) National Training Exercise (NTE).\n\nThe cave is privately owned and operated. It is open to the public on Sundays and most holidays from 10:00am to 4:00pm. Special arrangements can be made for school and group tours. Guided tours are available every hour, except during cave hunts and special events. Cave hunts take place every two weeks.\n\nThe cave is an attraction for geologists and spelunkers.\n\nThe cave was originally developed by Stephen Perry and was expanded by Frank Smith.\n\nIn June 2009, a group of spelunkers was led on a cave tour by a non-professional guide. As the group traversed an area that had recently experienced heavy rainfall, water began to flood the tunnel. Two members of the group were able to swim to safety. A third, Brian Stinson, was swept into a cave pool. The water was over deep and flowing at a speed of approximately . Stinson's body was recovered on July 5, 2009.\n\nAt the time of Stinson's death, the cave was being run by its owner, Robert Stoeckle. His son, Terry Stoeckle, is the manager. The Stoeckles were the first people to be certified as cave guides in the state of Iowa.\n\nSince 1990, there have been 16 deaths related to caving accidents.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>KFVE\n\nKFVE, virtual channel 5 (UHF digital channel 20), is a MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station licensed to Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. The station is owned by Morgan Murphy Media. KFVE's studios are located on Bishop Street in downtown Honolulu, and its transmitter is located near Akupu. The station's signal is relayed on satellite station KFVE-DT2 (virtual and UHF digital channel 20.2) in Hilo on the island of Hawaii; KFVE-DT2 serves as a full simulcast of the Honolulu station, and does not carry any additional syndicated programming on its own.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on August 12, 1988 as KHHH-TV. It was the first television station in Hawaii to be owned by an Asian American. During its first few years on the air, the station was a UPN affiliate. KHHH was a general entertainment independent station until 1995, when it became a charter affiliate of The WB. In 1997, KHHH became an affiliate of UPN; however, it was largely programmed as a WB affiliate because of the area's cable providers at the time, Oceanic Time Warner Cable and Hawaiian Telcom, were only able to offer the network's prime time programming.\n\nIn 1999, KHHH entered into a local marketing agreement with the Home Shopping Network and became a secondary affiliate of the network. After KITV (channel 4) launched its second digital subchannel to become an affiliate of This TV, KFVE discontinued its LMA with the HSN in favor of affiliating with that network's parent network, Movies! (now Pop), which launched on January 1, 2011.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. KHHH, which was expected to become the market's CW affiliate, instead signed an affiliation agreement with MyNetworkTV on September 13, 2006. KHHH changed its call letters to KFVE on October 18, 2006 to reflect its pending network switch. KFVE became a MyNetworkTV affiliate when that network launched on September 5, and adopted its current branding and logo on September 17.\n\nKFVE launched a second digital subchannel on January 1, 2011, to serve as a charter affiliate of Movies!, a network owned by Morgan Murphy Media that is also affiliated with Fox Television Stations' MyNetworkTV-affiliated stations through a time brokerage agreement. On April 1, 2013, the Movies! affiliation moved to the main channel, and KFVE-DT2 became a standard high-definition feed of KFVE. KFVE's main channel was also upgraded to high definition, becoming the first and only MyNetworkTV affiliate in Hawaii to broadcast in HD.\n\nOn January 24, 2014, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down Movies! and merge it with the Laff digital subchannel network as Pop, which would be an exclusively network-owned joint venture rather than a time brokerage agreement. Pop is available in HD on KFVE-DT3. The station's digital channel is multiplexed:\n!Channel number\n!Programming\n!Station\n!Notes\n\nKFVE discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 5, on January 15, 2009, the date in which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts (five months earlier than the June 12 transition date for stations on the U.S. mainland). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 20.

Prior to his death, he finished up several books, one of which is the aforementioned.The cover above features Mitch Rapp (an undercover CIA agent) in a suit, staring down the barrel of a gun. Looks like something a hard boiled detective would be doing in an opening scene of a film. But this is Mitch Rapp, and so it's kind of appropriate.is one of my favorite books in the Mitch Rapp series, which was why I was excited when I heard the news about this book coming out. While I have not read the rest of the series (I have the first three), I am not worried about starting at the end of the series.is supposed to be a companion piece to theseries. It's the origin story of Rapp, focusing on his relationship with his girlfriend. When the book was first released, I couldn't find much about it, except that it was a short book. I did not read a single review of the book prior to reading it.Since then, I've read some reviews, and while some have raved about the book, I've found some that were less than favorable. I understand why some people might not like it, as it is a prequel to the series. I can't comment on whether it's better or worse than the rest of the series, but I can say that it was enjoyable for me.My favorite part of the book was the initial assassination attempt on Rapp and his girlfriend, Anna. Flynn really sets the stage for the rest of the book here. I did like the fact that I knew it was Mitch Rapp right off the bat. It is hinted at in, but I like knowing exactly who Rapp is. Plus, I think it sets a precedent for the rest of the series, and will keep the series consistent. It's nice to know the events that lead to the \"end\" of Mitch Rapp's story.As I said before, I didn't read any reviews prior to reading this book. So it wasn't until I was about halfway through the book that I was aware that it was supposed to be a stand-alone. It wasn't a bad thing for me to read it this way, but I know that may bother some people. I didn't find the ending to be a cliff hanger in any way. Sure, it could have been better, but I didn't find it unsatisfying.I'm not sure if there is a market for prequels in the thriller genre, but I'm glad I read this book. I think it added another layer to the story. While I can't speak for the rest of the series, I can say thatis a good book. And that's coming from someone who hasn't read the other books in the series.<|endoftext|>One of the most important decisions a parent will make is when and where to enroll their child in preschool. Of course, you want the best for your child. Unfortunately, a lot of parents who are faced with a limited budget are left wondering how they can find a quality preschool. The answer is simple, you have to do your research.\n\nFirst, ask friends, family, neighbors and colleagues if they can recommend a preschool that their child has attended. Talk to parents who have children of the same age as your child. If possible, look at their children's behavior to see if they are on track and if they are being challenged. Another option is to contact the preschool of your choice and ask about the cost of tuition. You will want to ask if there is a reduced rate for siblings. If the preschool is very expensive, ask if the center offers payment plans or scholarships. Also, ask about the center's hours, what is included in the tuition and their method of transportation for pick up and drop off.<|endoftext|>\n\n\n\nWhen the pledge forms came home I was shocked at the number of girls who had signed up.

We had a few more practices to go and the big day had finally arrived, a week and a half before the season would start.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe girls were so excited about the prospect of playing in a real soccer game that they did not realize what they were getting into. After our final practice we gathered all of our equipment, most of which the girls had not used yet. Then they realized that they were not just playing in the season opener but also playing in their first ever soccer game. I could tell they were worried about what their parents would say if they played poorly and the opposing team scored goals against us. I reassured the girls that the parents would not be angry and I had their backs. I encouraged them to enjoy the moment and to have fun. They walked out of the house and piled into the bus for the long ride to the field. It was their first taste of competitive sports.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if the girls were nervous, excited, or what, but they were quiet on the bus ride to the field. When we got there, I introduced them to the coaches and the team. I asked the girls to look around at all of the girls that were going to be on the team. They cheered and all of the girls seemed to loosen up. When the girls saw the other team warming up they got nervous again. It was a good thing that the other team was the same age as us because if they had been older girls I think the girls would have been scared.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the parents came up to me and said \"Good luck!\" I said \"Thank you!\" Then I realized that this was our first official soccer game, not just practice. I asked her to be ready to take some pictures and she said \"Oh, I will!\" It was nice to have someone else taking pictures for a change.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a smaller team so I gave the girls the option of playing in the back or up front. Some of the girls chose to play in the back and I moved the other girls to the front. The girls who were playing in the back ended up having some fun being able to defend and clear the ball. The girls who were playing in the front did well too. The score was close but they kept at it. They did not give up when they were losing. At the half time the score was 4-1 and they kept it close.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parents and I were both very proud of the girls. We gave them high fives and told them to keep it up. I knew that they were nervous but I could tell that they had fun and enjoyed playing. They won the game, 8-4. I am so proud of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo M M Soccer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM is for the goals that she scores\n\nM is for the goalie that saves\n\nM is for the team that wins\n\nAnd I love M so much\n\n\n\n\n\nThese last two weeks we have had our first soccer practices and game. We had a large number of girls sign up for the team and we were split up into two teams. We played in an outside field and the girls really enjoyed it. As we were warming up the coach asked if anyone had shin guards and almost everyone had borrowed them from a parent or sibling.<|endoftext|>The dopaminergic effects of a catechin-polyphenol (epigallocatechin-3-gallate, EGCG) and its derivatives were investigated in striatal dopamine (DA) levels and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DA transporter (DAT) mRNA expression.

But as I have been pointing out in my weather report, the cooling trend has been continuing, and may have entered a new stage.\n\nThis is not good news for a lot of farmers, especially when you are growing winter crops.\n\nReport from the National Climatic Data Center:\n\nJanuary-through-May 2009 was the warmest such period on record for the contiguous United States. The average temperature of 51.0°F was 5.2°F above the 1901-2000 average and surpassed the previous record (set in 2007) by 0.2°F. This was also the third consecutive warm January-through-May period in the United States and also broke the record for the warmest such period.\n\nOnly seven states and the District of Columbia had below-average temperatures for January-through-May 2009, and these were scattered from New York and New Jersey to Arizona. Alaska and Hawaii were the two states with above-average temperatures for the first five months of 2009, while every other state was above average, including the District of Columbia.\n\nThe May 2009 nationwide temperature was the warmest on record for the contiguous United States, at 2.7°F above the 1901-2000 average. This surpassed the previous record (set in 2005) by 0.1°F and was also the second consecutive record warm May.\n\nThe warm temperatures across the United States contributed to the many record high temperatures for May 2009.\n\n(click here to read the full story)<|endoftext|>By Dick's Politics\n\nPresident Barack Obama’s deficit reduction committee voted on November 23 to cut Social Security benefits for the most vulnerable seniors and slash benefits to children of people who have worked in covered jobs, while increasing Medicare premiums and co-pays.\n\nThe bi-partisan group made its recommendations to Obama in a letter on November 23. The group’s plan will be the basis for the debt ceiling “grand bargain” that the White House and Congressional Republicans have been negotiating.\n\nThe co-chairs of the committee, Sen. Erskine Bowles (D-NC) and former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-WY), recommended cuts of up to 15 percent in Social Security and other entitlement programs as part of the group’s plan to reduce deficits by $4 trillion over ten years.\n\nIn exchange, Bowles and Simpson recommended raising the eligibility age for Social Security from 67 to 69, increasing Social Security taxes for higher-wage earners, and means-testing Social Security benefits.\n\nSimpson is a close friend of the oil billionaire Koch brothers, who bankroll numerous Tea Party groups.\n\nThe other nine members of the bipartisan committee who endorsed the group’s report were Sens. John Kerry (D-MA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kent Conrad (D-ND), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Alice Rivlin (D-DC), and James M.Rubio (R-FL).\n\nThe Bowles-Simpson plan includes additional recommendations, such as:\n\nA cut of 5 percent in the annual cost-of-living adjustment, which would reduce future benefits by about $3.5 trillion;\n\nA cut of $500 billion in annual Social Security benefits, which would lower the average benefit from $16,000 to about $14,000 a year;\n\nReducing Social Security cost-of-living adjustments for those with incomes over $85,000, with the highest income earners receiving no benefit increases, while those with lower incomes receiving no reductions;\n\nIncreasing Medicare premiums and co-pays for seniors by $500 billion; and\n\nA freeze on the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security, disability benefits, and veterans’ benefits.\n\nBowles and Simpson’s proposal also reduces the value of annual cost-of-living adjustments by $112 billion and increases the amount of income subject to the Social Security payroll tax by $128 billion, in order to cut $200 billion from the program.\n\nThe bi-partisan committee also endorsed cutting Medicare payments to providers, which would reduce provider reimbursements by 5 percent, along with requiring hospitals and other providers to share in the cost of health care quality improvements, which would save an additional $5.4 billion.\n\nThe committee also recommended increasing the premium for Medicare Part B by 15 percent.\n\nAmong its other recommendations are $600 billion in reductions to the federal workforce and another $600 billion in cuts to the military, but it does not specify where those cuts would come from.\n\nInstead, it says, “This recommendation does not specify where those cuts should be taken. We look forward to working with the administration, as well as the House and Senate, to develop these reductions.”\n\nOn November 23, the White House said it would incorporate the Bowles-Simpson report in its proposal to raise the debt ceiling.\n\n“We think the framework that the fiscal commission laid out is a very sensible one, and will serve as a basis for the White House as we look at the various proposals,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said. “It’s important to emphasize the progress that has been made on the commissions report.”\n\nHowever, Carney said he did not believe the report would be a sufficient basis for the White House’s negotiations with Congressional Republicans, which are still under way.\n\n“I don’t believe the commission report has sufficient votes to pass the Congress at this point,” Carney said. “But that doesn’t mean that it can’t, and that it shouldn’t, serve as a starting point for the President as he enters into negotiations with the Republican Party.”\n\nThe Bowles-Simpson report also recommends reducing the cost of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program by $270 billion, cutting Medicare subsidies to private insurance companies by $70 billion, reducing subsidies to federal employee health care by $110 billion, and cutting federal civilian and military retirement costs by $150 billion.\n\nThe nine Democratic and Republican committee members also recommended cutting a total of $500 billion in non-defense discretionary spending.\n\nThe"

REUTERS/Tony Gentile\n\nItaly has posted 10 straight quarters of economic contraction and data on Wednesday showed its banks have been suffering record bad loans losses.\n\n“Given the public debt dynamics, the (debt to gross domestic product) ratio will keep increasing for the foreseeable future, rising to around 130 percent of GDP in 2020,” Visco told the Senate.\n\nPublic debt will rise to 2.3 trillion euros ($2.56 trillion) this year and to 2.4 trillion euros ($2.65 trillion) in 2017, according to the latest figures from the Bank of Italy.\n\nEconomy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan warned earlier this month that the government may have to revise its goal of balancing the budget by 2018 after slower than expected growth.\n\nItaly’s public debt is second only to that of Greece in the euro zone, and its annual borrowing requirements of around 100 billion euros are equivalent to about 2 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nPublic debt stood at around 2 trillion euros at the end of 2015, equal to 133 percent of GDP, the Bank of Italy said.<|endoftext|>The few times I've had it with a sous vide steak, I've done the following:\n\nVacuum sealed (in an old Foodsaver model) a ribeye steak and took it out of the marinade before cooking. No frozen at all. The times I've done this, I've just sous vide it in a bag at 130F (see above for options).\n\nThis will probably not work as well for more than 1 steak unless you use a large, commercial Foodsaver and vacuum sealer.\n\nI just cook the steaks and store them in a tupperware container. I leave them in there for a few hours until they reach an internal temperature of 135F (my preferred temperature) and then take them out and put them in a plastic bag and store them in the fridge. They usually keep this way for a few days.\n\nOnce the steak has reached 135F, I remove it from the tupperware container and into a large ziplock bag. I press as much air out of the ziplock bag as possible (probably not totally necessary, but I'm cautious) and then put the ziplock bag in another ziplock bag with the rest of the steaks (the original storage bag, not the other ziplock bag). I leave this bag in the fridge for a few hours until I'm ready to cook the steak.\n\nOnce I'm ready to cook the steak, I usually let it come up to room temperature (in the bag). I then sear the steak in a cast iron skillet (a small one for a single steak, a larger one for more steaks). Once I'm done searing the steak, I remove it from the bag, let it rest a bit, and slice it. I have not had the issue of the juices from the steak leaking into the bag.\n\nEdit\n\nThis is probably more info than you want to deal with, but here is the initial reply I got on a similar post:\n\nI use VacMaster valve machines for sous vide. If you have a traditional FoodSaver type of machine, there is no issue with vacuum sealing it because you don't go past the water vapor pressure of air. The pressure in a food saver is high enough to prevent any vapor from entering the bag but if you really wanted to go crazy you could make a stainless steel bag that you put in the water bath. It's easy to remove a whole ribeye or strip loin and then just let it cool down for a few hours. When you're ready to cook it just let it come up to room temperature on the counter and then it's ready to go. I don't even put it in the fridge.\n\nI'm using the same technique that Alton Brown uses on his show.\n\nAn alternative way to do it would be to buy some sausage casings and then put the steak in a casing. When you are ready to cook it, tie off the end and put it in the water. This will prevent juices from leaking out.<|endoftext|>If your little guy likes to stay cool during the warmer months with a splash in the pool, this speedo Swim Trunks is a great option.

The first, House Bill 589, requires voters to present a photo ID when voting. (A US Census study showed that 10 percent of North Carolina's registered voters lack a driver's license or a state-issued photo ID.) Ad Policy\n\nThe second, Senate Bill 666, is even worse. Its sponsor, Thom Goolsby, explained that \"if you go to the polls and you have a North Carolina college ID, it's not going to work, because the legislature decided we're going to make it harder for students to vote.\"\n\nGoolsby also offered this remarkable defense of the bill: \"I would suggest to you that half of the students voting [are] not residents of North Carolina.\" This is patently untrue. The only people whose votes are challenged at the polls are those who sign an affidavit affirming that they're eligible to vote, claiming they're not a resident of the state. Goolsby can offer no justification for his claim because no such justification exists.\n\nDemocrats are angry, but the real question is what will North Carolina Republicans do when their bill—designed to reduce the turnout of Democratic voters—proves insufficient for the job?\n\nIn a state that's barely hanging on to a narrow Democratic majority—Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney by just 92,000 votes in 2012—every vote counts. The Republicans' HB 589 is a desperate attempt to skew the vote in their favor. And by targeting students—a group that tends to be more progressive than their non-college-educated peers—they may actually be doing Democrats a favor. But their effort to block students from voting will almost certainly fail. \"We have a lot of students who have historically supported Democratic candidates, and that's part of the reason we wanted to bring these bills forward,\" said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the conservative group, the North Carolina Voter Integrity Project.<|endoftext|>Social Media Overload\n\nThe average American spends 4.7 hours a day using social media, according to Nielsen. Of course, if you’re reading this blog, you’re probably already aware of that number and much higher.\n\nFacebook still accounts for the largest share of that time, about 1.7 hours a day. And it’s likely that you’re spending more time on Facebook than you think. In fact, a recent study found that users who check their Facebook feed less frequently (and presumably are more conscious of the fact that they’re on Facebook) report feeling more negatively about their time spent on the social network than users who check Facebook more frequently. The reason: frequent Facebook users were not fully aware of the amount of time they were spending on the site.\n\nFacebook’s desire to keep you on the site is apparent in how it ranks updates in your feed. Updating your status is much more likely to show up on your friends’ News Feeds if they spend more time on the site, which is why there’s a nudge to “write something on your friend’s wall” in the status update box.\n\nEven when you’re not actually on Facebook, it’s working on ways to keep you in its orbit. The company released a study earlier this year that found that Facebook is just as good at keeping you connected to your friends as your spouse is.\n\nHere’s another fact for you: while it might seem like Facebook is eating up your whole day, the average user spends only about 15 minutes per day on the site. But that’s still not that much.\n\nA study by Stoppelman found that of the two hours and 17 minutes users spend on the Internet each day, an average of half an hour is spent on Facebook. (Interestingly, the study also found that 25% of users spend less than five minutes on Facebook each day).\n\nSome more numbers: the average Facebook user has 130 friends and creates 90 pieces of content (posts, photos, and links) each month. According to a Facebook report, users share 2.4 pieces of content per day. On a day that Facebook has a new feature or event, that number jumps to four.\n\nFacebook is clearly focused on keeping people on the site. In fact, a recent study from the University of Wisconsin showed that Facebook is not just keeping its users there — it’s actually altering their brains, making it more difficult for people to keep their attention away from the site.\n\nThe company has even toyed with the idea of charging users to remove ads, but apparently it’s not planning to follow through on the plan.\n\nOther stats:\n\n– 200 million photos per day are uploaded to Facebook.\n\n– More than 25 million people play Facebook games every day.\n\n– Each month, people send around 750 million private Facebook messages.\n\n(Check out our Inside Scoop post for more Facebook stats.)\n\nThe same study that found Facebook users underestimate their time on the site also revealed that they underestimated the amount of time they spent on YouTube, too. According to Nielsen, users spend an average of 15 minutes a day on YouTube — compared to the 20 minutes per day they report.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, the most popular video topics on YouTube in 2012 were music, news, and celebrity/ gossip. (Other popular topics include “how to,” “funny,” “dance,” and “news.”)\n\nWhen it comes to time spent, YouTube is a close second to Facebook: Nielsen’s research found that people spend 15 minutes a day on YouTube, which is only about two minutes less than they spend on Facebook.\n\nAnd, while the vast majority of YouTube videos are viewed on a desktop or laptop, mobile viewing is increasing. According to the company, the number of users who watch YouTube videos on mobile devices increased by 75% in 2012, to more than 1 billion views per day.\n\nNumbers: 4.7 hours a day spent on social media, 1.7 hours a day spent on Facebook, and 15 minutes a day spent on YouTube.\n\n[Image Credit: Flickr user Magnus D]<|endoftext|>A 53-year-old Uber driver from Menlo Park was arrested this week on suspicion of sexually assaulting a young woman who was intoxicated after she left a San Francisco bar and passed out in his car.\n\nThe arrest Monday night of Alaric Spence on felony charges of rape and kidnapping, both with a person under 14 years old, came after the woman’s parents contacted authorities.\n\nSpence, a married father of three, is suspected of taking advantage of the woman when she was at a bar in San Francisco on the evening of Dec"
"in Design\n\nFew months ago I decided to switch from a well known host called Hostmonster. The reasons for the change were pretty simple: poor customer support, a poor control panel, bad servers and so on.\n\nI wanted a new web host for my blog, for my family and for my business. I know that the decision is really important because if the web host is bad, the users will find out very fast and you will lose a lot of customers.\n\nSo I started to look for a new web host and I decided to try Bluehost.

"As always, I've been gathering and compiling a list of favorite quotes. I've always loved sharing quotes with friends and family. I thought I would start sharing some of my favorite quotes on my blog. This quote is from Scott DeGarmo's Blog . It's a favorite because it resonates with me. Enjoy!\n\nThe longer I live the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude to me is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill. It will make or break a company… a church… a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past… we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that whatever I plant in my mind will one day become my reality.\n\nWhen people spend their days in an environment where attitudes are positive, and have opportunities to interact with other people who are motivated and produce positive outcomes, they become energized. You may say, “I do not choose to be positive.” But it is your choice to be positive or negative, no one else. You have a choice. You have a choice to be happy or sad. You have a choice to be motivated or to complain. You have a choice to succeed or to fail. You have a choice to be positive or negative. You are in control of your own attitude. The first thing to remember is that it is your choice, you are in control.<|endoftext|>Sometimes things don’t work out as planned. Take my 2010 travel plans, for example. I thought I was going to spend the whole year in one place. Instead, I had five different apartments in three different countries in four different months. My road trip from Florida to Illinois and back, was a homecoming I hadn’t anticipated. I thought I’d be able to spend a month back home, and then hit the road again with my friend Peter. He didn’t move on like I did, and for that, I was sorry. But for the first time, I had friends in my old home town, so I made the most of it. This post will be short and sweet, as it was all about the people. I have plenty of postcards of landscapes and monuments to give you if you want to see those. This one is just for you.\n\nFor those of you I was able to see in my whirlwind tour, this post is for you.\n\nMeeting up with my old friend Sarah in Tennessee. She is a treasure. A memory I’ll never forget. (And a great dresser)\n\nMy first night in Memphis, I met an old friend from high school. His name was Jeremy and he was a character. He gave me a place to stay, and on our way to his home he gave me a gift. He’d gotten it at the World’s Fair in Tennessee and couldn’t bear to throw it out.\n\nWhen we got to his house, it turned out to be his apartment complex. He wasn’t kidding when he said “come to my place”. He did have a bed and room for me, but I did my own cooking and dishes. I was still his guest. I thought about taking his offer, but he had work the next day and I wanted to hang out with him. We went to the only gay bar in Memphis.\n\nI’d been to Nashville before, but not Memphis. I loved it. The sounds of the night- the crickets and the doves- the humidity, the light drizzle of rain- it was everything I’d remembered, but with a twist. I’d never been to the east side of the city before, so I loved my first sight of the river and the bridges. I loved the old brick buildings and the old neighborhoods. It’s a great city, and it’s only 90 minutes from my parents’ house. I love that.\n\nI spent a lot of time with Peter while I was home. We spent a lot of time visiting parks, cemeteries, and battlefields. My favorite of those three is Cumberland Falls State Park. We spent an entire afternoon hiking. It was amazing. The weather was perfect, the water was perfect, and the views were perfect. It was like heaven.\n\nWe went for a road trip, but first we had to make a stop at my old hometown. I took him by my old house, my old church, and all of my old haunts.\n\nAnd then we went to the Nascar race. I loved the live music. I loved the atmosphere. I loved the people, but most of all, I loved the weather. It was just like that old song. It was a beautiful day.\n\nAnd we spent our last day at the beach. I had never been to the Gulf of Mexico before, so I was in heaven. It was perfect.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>Sci-fi Thriller Series ‘The Darkening Field’ in Development as a Motion Picture\n\nby Anthony C. Schembri\n\nWith the success of recent sci-fi/horror films like Annihilation and The Shape of Water, a new thriller that takes the sci-fi genre to the next level is being adapted for the screen. The Darkening Field is the first installment of a six book sci-fi/horror series by the same name, written by D.J. Butler. The author currently has three novels published.\n\nAfter being discharged from the British military due to a mental breakdown, Major Jack Ketch must uncover the mysteries of a huge field of dark matter while battling dark forces from his own past. With Jack at the helm, the book takes you on a horrific voyage into a bizarre and dangerous world that has a lot in common with our own.\n\nA film adaptation of The Darkening Field is currently being developed by director Robyn Eckhardt (The Haunting in Connecticut, The Call) and writer Nathaniel Hanks (The Mothman Prophecies). Hanks and Eckhardt are currently in pre-production on The Darkening Field, having secured investors and having begun the development of the screenplay.\n\n“We’re excited to work on The Darkening Field, a story that will truly resonate with fans of the horror/sci-fi genre,” said Robyn Eckhardt.\n\nThe Darkening Field is in the early stages of development, but will hopefully get the green light in the coming months.\n\nThe original Darkening Field novel is available for purchase on Amazon.<|endoftext|>Cleveland Police Officers Told Not to Shoot for Themselves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleveland Police officers in the city’s First and Second Districts are being told not to shoot at people who shoot at them first.\n\nOfficers are being ordered to let suspects shoot them first, so they don’t accidentally hit any citizens in the line of fire.\n\nThe decision comes after the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department reviewed a video of a November 16th incident in which officers shot at a man who fired a gun into the air outside the University Inn on Lakeside Avenue.\n\nThe suspect fled the scene, but was arrested. The man who was shot at, was a patron inside a nearby lounge who was struck in the leg by a stray bullet fired by officers.\n\n“I just felt the bullet hit my leg and I looked and I saw a hole in my leg and I was like ‘what just happened?’” said Tonya Frazier. “The whole thing happened so fast I didn’t really know.”\n\nShe said she didn’t feel pain and there was no blood at first.\n\nOfficers at the scene treated the wound by putting towels on it, then put her on a chair and put a bandage over the wound.\n\n“If it wasn’t for the bulletproof vest and for him taking me to the ground, I probably wouldn’t be here today,” said Frazier.\n\nPolice Chief Calvin Williams said in a letter to officers that the decision was made because citizens were present and officers did not know who fired the shots.\n\nOfficers in the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association were infuriated by the decision and say it places their lives in danger.\n\nUnion President Steve Loomis said the order is the direct result of the city of Cleveland settling with the Department of Justice on the consent decree and the slow down of training.\n\n“In effect, he’s going to have his officers shooting each other. That’s the end result of this,” said Loomis.\n\nSheriff’s Department Spokesman John O’Brien said in a statement that the union is focused on officers being placed at risk. He said the chief is giving officers the proper training, stressing that they cannot fire a weapon at someone shooting at them.\n\nDeputies found three guns at the scene. One of the guns had been reported stolen.\n\nUnion officials are calling for Loomis’ termination, citing the fact that he told them there was not enough money to train the department properly.\n\n© 2017 WKYC-TV<|endoftext|>Quand je l'ai vue en ligne j'étais interloqué.

She said she has had regular conversations with Lighthizer, Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo and Jesus Seade, the chief NAFTA negotiator for incoming Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.\n\nMexico has warned it won’t ratify the new deal unless the auto tariffs are excluded.\n\nFreeland, for her part, did not sound optimistic about that prospect, saying it was an issue for the USTR.\n\n“This is something we’re going to be talking about over the course of the next little while,” she said.\n\nFreeland added that she has yet to meet with incoming Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard.\n\nThe USMCA is facing opposition from political forces on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nLast month, incoming Mexican president Lopez Obrador said he wouldn’t put his signature on the new deal until it is renegotiated. And in the U.S., Democrats have vowed to fight it, as have labour and environmental groups, both in Washington and in the provinces.\n\nFreeland made a quick visit to Washington to consult with congressional leaders. The result was a decision by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and some other top Democrats not to sign off on a resolution ratifying the deal, at least not until the 232 auto tariffs are excluded.\n\nFreeland said Canada’s position has been well received by congressional leaders.\n\n“We’re going to continue to talk to U.S. Congress members and senators. I was on the Hill today, I was in both the Democratic and the Republican side, and I found that our position on 232 is widely understood and I found the conversations on the Hill to be positive.”\n\nMexico and Canada have also expressed their opposition to the 232 auto tariffs.\n\n“If it’s implemented, it would have significant impacts on the economy of the United States,” Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez told a news conference in Mexico City.\n\n“For the region, it would generate a lot of uncertainty,” she added.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue expressed disappointment with the Canadian position, saying Ottawa was obstructing progress.\n\n“I find it very disappointing, and if I were them, I’d be really anxious about their relationship with the United States,” Perdue said in a telephone interview from Colombia.\n\n“We’re not trying to disrupt the relationship. But you have to have a deal that’s a good deal.”\n\nPerdue added he was “extremely surprised” that the Canadian government was still resisting U.S. demands on the 232 issue.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, however, has praised the deal, and told Lighthizer on Tuesday that he wants him to negotiate it.\n\n“I look forward to working with you Bob on expediting the U.S.M.C.A. agreement to benefit our workers, farmers and manufacturers,” Trump wrote in a memo to Lighthizer that the USTR released Wednesday.\n\n“I have asked the Vice-President and the United States Trade Representative to continue negotiating with Canada on the terms of a possible agreement.”\n\nTrump is suggesting that his 232 probe is already settled, a position with which the Canadian source disputed.\n\n“That’s a pretty low bar,” the source said.\n\nThis story originally appeared on CBC<|endoftext|>“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” actress Daisy Ridley revealed she wants to “kill” the term “strong female character.”\n\n“We keep saying strong female characters. ‘We want strong female characters,’” Ridley said during an interview with The Daily Beast published Monday. “What we need is a female lead and more of them, and I’m not saying that those women can’t be in danger, of course they can, and be brave, of course they can, but can we stop talking about being strong all the time?”\n\nRidley has played Rey in the “Star Wars” sequel trilogy, which has earned over $1 billion at the box office and will conclude with “Star Wars: Episode IX” in December 2019. She also stars as a woman driven"

My hair was silky soft without any heavy feeling. I love that it has SPF in it. This is a definite must have. 01-29-12\n\nStill Going Strong... ...after about 5 or 6 months. This is a really good buy, especially since it's usually on sale. I love the scent - not too floral, not too perfumey, just pleasant. This is a very rich, very nice conditioner that makes my hair silky smooth. I do recommend it, but the jury is still out on whether I'll buy it again because my hair has changed and I need a different type of product. 01-25-12\n\nnot the product for me I don't like the fragrance of this conditioner, it is too flowery. I usually love everything from QVC and try not to get disappointed by not returning but I will be sending this one back. 01-23-12\n\nBrilliant This conditioner is the best conditioner I have used in a long time. I have long hair, color treated, thick, and it is still soft, silky, and my hair is so much easier to manage since I started using this product. I am truly amazed. You won't be disappointed. 01-23-12\n\nPleasantly Surprised I am so glad I purchased this conditioner. My hair is long and curly and dry and damaged. I needed something that would make my hair soft and moisturized. I also wanted something with sunscreen protection. I use a rinse out conditioner along with this. My hair is soft, manageable, shiny, and the best part it is very moisturized. I will definately purchase again. 01-23-12\n\nLove this I love this conditioner. My hair has never been more soft, my scalp has never been so clean and healthy. I am so glad I made this purchase. 11-15-11\n\nLove, Love, Love I received my conditioner last week. I love it. It makes my hair so soft and healthy. I have color treated hair and I would recommend this to everyone who has color treated hair. Thank you Jamie. 11-10-11\n\nExcellent I got this on the blowout sale and I am glad I did. I have always wanted to try this conditioner and am glad I did. My hair is fine, color treated and this conditioner leaves my hair silky and shiny. I did notice it makes my hair a little frizzy but I spray on some Keri Spray and that stops it. I am a first time user of K-pak products and love them. 11-09-11\n\nMy hair is fine & dry. Great product. Hair is soft, shiny, & tangle free. Does not weigh hair down. 11-09-11\n\nLove It! This is the best conditioner I have ever used! It's not expensive, but works great! My hair is dry and I blow dry it, but it looks so great now, it doesn't need to be blow dried. The ends have never looked so healthy! I would highly recommend this! 11-06-11<|endoftext|>Dez Bryant is still on the market, and there’s a chance he’s not going to be signing anytime soon.

"A study on the mental health of transgender individuals\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of Discrimination on Mental Health in Transgender People.\n\nThis study looked at the impact of discrimination on the mental health of transgender people.\n\nThere is a paucity of research on the health status of transgender people and, in particular, the impact of discrimination on their health.\n\nA better understanding of the mental health of transgender people is therefore urgently needed to inform the development of evidence-based practice for reducing the impact of stigma and improving the health of transgender people.\n\nIn order to address this gap in the research, this study looked at the impact of discrimination on mental health of transgender individuals using a cross-sectional design.\n\nForty-three transgender adults (41.9% male-to-female and 58.1% female-to-male) from the US-based Transgender Discrimination Survey were analysed using logistic regression.\n\nStudy details\n\nResults\n\nThe study found that experiences of discrimination were common in the preceding year and were strongly associated with lifetime mental health problems.\n\nIndividuals who reported discrimination had a greater prevalence of mental health issues, including depression (Odds Ratio = 2.54, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.11–5.80), anxiety disorder (OR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.29–4.71), post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.13–6.05), alcohol problems (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.03–3.58), and suicide attempt (OR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.23–4.53).\n\nThese results highlight the potential impact of discrimination on mental health of transgender individuals, and further underscore the need for public health strategies to address the impact of stigma and discrimination on the health and well-being of transgender people.\n\nHow the results can be used\n\nThis study highlights the important impact that discrimination can have on the mental health of transgender individuals.\n\nAs this was a cross-sectional study, it is not possible to determine if discrimination preceded the mental health problems, but this is likely to be the case.\n\nWhat this study adds\n\nThis is one of the first studies to identify the prevalence of discrimination and its association with mental health problems among transgender people.\n\nThe results support the need to develop public health strategies to reduce the impact of stigma and discrimination on the health of transgender individuals.\n\nFurther research is needed to establish the direction of causation between discrimination and mental health outcomes.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nThe study, published in the journal Health Affairs , looked at the impact of discrimination on the mental health of transgender people.\n\nResearchers from the University of Washington and University of Arizona analysed data from the 2011–12 US Transgender Discrimination Survey, which assessed the impact of discrimination and violence on transgender adults.\n\nThe results showed that experiences of discrimination were common in the preceding year, with 33.1% of respondents reporting experiences of discrimination in employment, 26.7% in the provision of health care, 22.4% in the education system, 21.8% in public accommodations, and 34.2% in the judicial system.\n\nThis study also found that experiences of discrimination were strongly associated with lifetime mental health problems.\n\nIndividuals who reported discrimination had a greater prevalence of mental health issues, including depression (odds ratio = 2.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.11–5.80), anxiety disorder (odds ratio = 2.45, 95% confidence interval: 1.29–4.71), post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio = 2.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.13–6.05), alcohol problems (odds ratio = 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.03–3.58), and suicide attempt (odds ratio = 2.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–4.53).\n\nThis study shows that discrimination is common among transgender individuals in the US.\n\nIt suggests that the adverse mental health consequences of discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression are prevalent in this population and should be addressed by the implementation of anti-discrimination policies.\n\nRead more on Elsevier Connect.\n\nResearchers from the University of Washington in the US and University of Arizona in the US carried out the study.<|endoftext|>The previous page is sending you to http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2517139/Shocking-moment-smiling-boy-12-wins-100m-race-mistakes-starting-block.html If you do not want to visit that page, you can return to the previous page<|endoftext|>Changelog\n\nFebruary 13, 2015: See U/L's of R/S/E/FR/LG rom on pc.ibm.com -

"Anyone who has played the first two games in the Mass Effect series has heard of the geth. They are the robot race that has been warring with humanity since the very beginning of the franchise. The geth also has their own story in the game. Unfortunately, I’m not entirely sure if that story is meant to be fully understood. There’s no doubt that there is a lot of depth to the geth. They were created by a being known as the Quarians. After the two races separated, the Quarians realized they had actually created a sort of god that was far more intelligent than they had ever anticipated. The geth decided that they didn’t want to be slaves to the Quarians. They were willing to do what it took to be their own race. They fought against the Quarians. After their species split, the geth created an operating system called Legion. They decided that if they were ever going to be able to survive, they needed to be able to self-replicate. Legion gave them this ability. I’m not entirely sure how it works, but it gives the geth the ability to create more geth from just raw materials.\n\nThe geth, however, are a bit lacking when it comes to individuality. As I mentioned before, they all share a single consciousness. This is how they can replicate so quickly. They also share a unified goal of being able to survive. Every geth is fully aware of everything that has ever happened to any geth. This is why they are so advanced. When the geth made the decision to end their slavery and create an all-encompassing artificial intelligence that they could all share, they also created a virtual heaven for themselves. There are thousands upon thousands of geth in this virtual reality. This is why you see so many of them. As the geth don’t actually need to eat, sleep, or rest, they are able to spend almost all of their time enjoying their virtual existence. Unfortunately, this virtual heaven is also a source of their weakness. They don’t really care about being destroyed. They don’t really care about living or dying. They don’t really care about humanity as a whole. Their only goal is to create this virtual existence so they can spend the rest of eternity existing there.\n\nThey have one goal: to reach this virtual paradise.\n\nWhy They Were Chosen\n\nI’m not entirely sure why the geth were chosen. Maybe because they are a difficult race to create, maybe because their evolution is so fascinating, maybe because of how their mind works. In my opinion, they are such an unusual race that it makes them extremely unique. I love the idea that they want to reach this virtual heaven. The geth are a bit of an enigma, and the idea that they are fighting for a goal that they don’t even understand makes them even more unique. Their story is not easy to figure out. It is more than likely that they are also a bit confusing for the people who have created the Mass Effect franchise. This makes them a perfect race to base the story of Mass Effect 3 on.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...<|endoftext|>[ Thanks to Steven J.

After the signing of the contract extension, the trade of Ubaldo Jimenez, and the contract extension of Troy Tulowitzki, the Rockies are reportedly ready to sign first baseman Justin Morneau to a three year deal worth about $12 million per season.\n\nMorneau is a .294 career hitter with 223 home runs and 637 RBIs. The only knock on him is his lack of durability. Morneau has played more than 120 games only once in his career. Last season, the seven-year Minnesota Twin and former American League MVP battled a number of injuries that led to him hitting .238 with 15 homers and 55 RBIs in only 101 games.<|endoftext|>As it turns out, we all might need more than the 50-million job target that the new government has promised to deliver.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi seems to be fully convinced that there is nothing a government can’t do if it has the will.

His second decision has been to initiate a new housing policy to ensure affordable housing to everyone.\n\nIt will be fair to say that India is facing a major problem in the form of inadequate jobs. And the solution lies in generating more employment and in the process increasing our productive capacity.\n\nAccording to a World Bank report released last week, India has a whopping 50 million youth who are neither employed nor in education and training (NEEF) in the 15-24 age group. According to the same report, this figure is more than double of the number of unemployed in the same age group (25 million).\n\nThe report, prepared jointly by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the Population Division of the United Nations, is titled: World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends for Youth 2015. It has been prepared on the basis of data from 189 countries.\n\nAccording to the report, while India has 50 million youth in the age group of 15-24 who are NEETs (not in employment, education or training), in Pakistan, the figure is only 19 million. The report also notes that South Asia accounts for over a quarter of the world’s youth population (which is 816 million). The majority of youth in the region are located in India (258 million) and Pakistan (124 million). In addition, in India alone, there are 258 million adults in the age group of 25-54, most of whom are likely to be in the labour force.\n\nThe report is relevant, because it is the first time that a report on youth employment has been compiled by the World Bank, which is headquartered in Washington, DC. While most studies have traditionally concentrated on adult employment, this is the first report to take into account the fact that a large number of youth in the world remain outside the labour force and they constitute a major challenge.\n\nThe report notes that the high share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) and the low share of youth in employment (just one-third of 15-24 years of age) have important implications for policy-making and for understanding the future impact of demographic changes on the labour market.\n\nThe"
"Summary\n\nThis story starts out with 16-year-old Lia who’s new to the high school. A boy named Kellan, who is considered the most popular kid in school, starts flirting with Lia right away. He tells her she’s the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen and offers to be her boyfriend. Lia accepts, even though she knows they are from completely different worlds. He is the rich son of a popular doctor and she is a social outcast. She knows she will never fit in with his friends or at school. She doesn’t care though, because she is totally infatuated with Kellan.\n\nShortly after Kellan, Lia meets the “Crazy Eight”, a group of misfits, who have all suffered at the hands of bullies. She learns that all of them have “curse” and they all go to Lia for advice on how to handle it. Lia soon learns that they all have a gift that goes along with their curse. The curse allows them to break the laws of nature and bring the dead back to life. After this, they all soon become inseparable and form a secret society called the Ouroboros Society.\n\nThroughout this story, Lia learns that there are also creatures that want to destroy the Ouroboros Society. There are creatures known as “Sidhe”, who are otherworldly beings that can bring people back to life. The Sidhe want to use the power of the Ouroboros Society for evil. Also, there are other creatures called “Crimson”, who want to use the power of the Ouroboros Society for their own purposes.\n\nLia also discovers that her mother is alive, but has no memory of anything that happened to her since the night Lia’s mother went missing. Lia’s mother has been living in the woods, in a cabin with a man named Jonathan. She also has a baby named Owen. Lia is happy to have her mother back, but she soon finds out that her mother is addicted to drugs. Jonathan is also an addict and he has been giving Lia’s mother drugs in order to control her. Lia goes to great lengths to try to help her mother and eventually succeeds.\n\nLia and her friends soon discover that the Ouroboros Society is a lot more powerful than they could have ever imagined. They learn that they are the “Saviours” and have the power to bring the dead back to life, but this only lasts for five minutes. Lia eventually finds out that the reason her father has been away so much was because he was working as a secret agent for the Ouroboros Society, but his cover was blown and he had to go into hiding. Lia also finds out that her father is still alive, but in bad shape. The Ouroboros Society brings her father back to life and he makes a full recovery.\n\nWhen Lia and the Ouroboros Society finally have the chance to meet with the leaders of the Ouroboros Society, they discover that the leaders are trying to destroy the Ouroboros Society, but they cannot. Lia and the Ouroboros Society must find a way to stop them. They know the leaders are only using them for their own purposes and the Ouroboros Society will cease to exist if they destroy it.\n\nAll of the Ouroboros Society members put their lives at risk to save the society. The leaders are arrested and Lia’s father takes over as the head of the Ouroboros Society. Lia’s father is now the president.<|endoftext|>A mysterious and ancient organization that runs the world from behind the scenes.

That was then, this is now. Now I have expanded my horizons to include this highly, highly enjoyable show called Epic Meal Time. What is it about? Food, obviously. And ridiculousness. And Canadians. More specifically, though, it is about the most Epic of Meals, in that they are very, very awesome. They are cooked, yes, but also very bizarre in their preparation, including highly (yet entertainingly) painful stunts such as \"the Buffalo Wing Challenge,\" in which the chef tries to eat (and/or vomit) an entire pound of wings.\n\n\n\nAnd to complement the decadence, Epic Meal Time has a soundtrack that's perfectly themed to the show. The music is mostly house/dance/dubstep, and each episode has a song at the end that is the perfect finale. Each episode also has the most enjoyable opening sequence I have ever seen. It's four guys sitting around a table, either cooking or eating, and each has a mike in front of them, and they rattle off all the things that they are going to cook or eat that day, using the word \"epic\" as much as possible. And it's hilarious. Then the song kicks in, and you're off to the races.\n\n\n\nI know that it's a bit difficult to explain what this show is all about without showing it to you, but trust me, it's hilarious. It's almost like watching a housewife's cooking show (so maybe don't watch with your parents) but with a more liberal definition of the word \"epic.\" A very liberal definition. Like, the guys take a whole cow, cut it up, and grill it (all in one day) and then use all of the body parts, from the head to the hooves, in different dishes. I mean, what more could you want from a show?\n\n\n\nI tried to find the episode I have to show you, but the only thing I could find was the show with the crazy amounts of shrimp in it. Now, I would normally not be interested in eating shrimp, but it was worth watching just to hear one of the guys explain why he thinks \"shrimp is a very controversial seafood.\"\n\n\n\nAnd just to show you how versatile this band is, here's a completely different kind of video, with their song \"What I'm Made Of.\" It's a \"behind-the-scenes\" type thing where they all tell the camera that they are made of meat, which in turn makes them look like meat. How clever! The band even includes an occasional video that they call \"Shank It,\" where they do stuff with their shank. It's fun to watch and to listen to.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, to sum up, I know that I have kind of trashed on most of the music that I have listened to this year, but not on this one. I hope that you check out Epic Meal Time, because it is hilarious, and the songs are pretty catchy, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments<|endoftext|>* Clocks now just-works, including:\n\n- Windows 2000 through 10\n\n- X86 and X64\n\n- Debian, Gentoo, Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE\n\n- Windows Server 2008R2 through Server 2012R2\n\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n\n"

It's a smart book, carefully researched and written with panache and wit\". Keith Byers, in his review for \"The New York Times\", finds the book \"occasionally confused\" and \"clumsy\" but praises its \"contemporary relevance and humor\" and says it \"has the power to open minds\".\n\n<|endoftext|>Sturgeon River\n\nSturgeon River may refer to:\n\nIn Canada:\n\nIn the United States:\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Julia Fahl\n\nJulia Fahl (born 1974) is a German author and journalist.

The hospital was the precursor to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In the early 2000s, the Washington National Cathedral sold the Camp Mills site to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel for $25 million in order to raise money to cover maintenance and operating costs. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel constructed the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton on the property and purchased the remaining land from the cathedral. The residences consist of the , 45-story The Ritz-Carlton Residences, the 39-story The Residences at the Ritz-Carlton, and the five-story Ritz-Carlton Residences. The project was designed by Rafael Vinoly, with interior design by Thierry Despont and the landscape design by Peter Walker.\n\nThe residences were listed for sale in May 2017. A contract to sell the residences to an unnamed buyer was signed in July 2017, but the sales contract was cancelled in December 2017. In January 2018, the residences were again listed for sale with a $600 million price tag. The residences were again sold in February 2018 to the BTA Group, an investment fund controlled by the Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Cleveland Cavaliers draft history\n\nThis is a list of draft picks by the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Auf den ersten Blick sehr enttäuschend, gibt es doch nur 2 Hotels direkt am Strand. Wir haben dann aber festgestellt, dass man sich für diese Hotels ein Hotel mit dem gemieteten Mietwagen erreichen kann. Daher empfehlen wir euch unbedingt ein Auto mitzunehmen. In der Gegend um das Hotel Jade in Kualapuu wird es einem durchaus zu eng.\n\nHotel Kualapuu bei Bali\n\nHotel Kualapuu ist ein kleines Hotel direkt am Strand von Kualapuu. Das ist die größte der drei Orte bei der Gegend Bali. Bali ist eine Insel im Indischen Ozean. Kualapuu liegt auf der Nachbarinsel der größeren Insel Bali. Wir empfehlen euch unbedingt ein Auto mitzunehmen.\n\nGegend Bali und auch die umliegende Gegend ist recht dünn besiedelt. So gibt es nur eine Hauptstraße die zu den 3 Orten führt. Es gibt eine kleine Bucht zum Schwimmen und es gibt einen Strand mit Sand. Aber man bekommt davon nicht viel zu sehen.\n\nDer Besitzer des Hotels ist ein kleiner Grieche. Der spricht allerdings ein wenig Deutsch. In dem Hotel wird euch auch das Essen serviert. Wenn man es nicht mag wird euch Essen vom Nachbarn gegen einen Obulus verkauft.\n\nDa der Besitzer Grieche ist, wird das Essen auch griechisch. Mit dem Griechenland Bali haben die 2 Inseln aber eigentlich nichts gemeinsam.\n\nDas Hotel befindet sich in einem Garten mit Gummibaum, zahlreichen Körnerpflanzen, einem wunderbar geflochtenen Strandkorb und vielem mehr. Die Gäste des Hotels nutzen diese Ruhe vorzüglich zum entspannen. Wir können das Hotel Kualapuu durchaus empfehlen. Wir waren sogar schon mehrfach dort. Die Zimmer im Hotel Kualapuu sind super günstig.

When combined with data science and advanced analytics, they offer tremendous potential to increase the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.\n\nWhen it comes to the new opportunities and challenges brands are facing, digital marketing expert Michael Perry sees a clear shift from traditional brand-building to new techniques that include the real-time deployment of targeted messaging and campaigns across channels.\n\n\"Traditionally, brands have used ad budgets to “build awareness,” a process that typically starts with a brand building awareness in their home market, expanding to the local market, then the national market, then the global market. This type of building awareness was effective at the time, but no longer the case. Consumers are bombarded with thousands of marketing messages every day. Ad fatigue has become a major concern for brands, and the success of a brand relies on how much more frequently consumers are seeing and engaging with that brand. This requires a shift from ad-based awareness building to content-based brand building. This is the type of work that requires machine learning and data science techniques, which need to be done in real-time and optimized on a continual basis.”\n\nRead more at Forbes<|endoftext|>Mahershala Ali was part of the cast of the Oscar-winning Moonlight and stars in Marvel's forthcoming superhero blockbuster, Black Panther.\n\n\n\nHe's the frontrunner to win Best Supporting Actor at the upcoming Academy Awards for his role in Moonlight, and he's already won the Golden Globe. But, in a new interview with The New York Times Magazine, Ali admitted that he didn't have much of a plan for his post-Moonlight life.\n\n\"The truth is, I'm pretty much a day-to-day guy,\" Ali said. \"It was one thing at a time. I was doing one job at a time, getting to live one dream at a time.\"\n\nAli, who is a Muslim, said he was surprised at how he was depicted in the media when the movie's director, Barry Jenkins, said that a scene in the film depicting two gay men falling in love was important to him because it depicted an all-black cast in a way that was \"natural and effortless.\"\n\n\"The narrative around it became, 'Black people are gay,'\" Ali said. \"Well, they’re not. I mean, we know they’re gay. We live with them. I love them. It was nothing more than, 'I’m glad that this image of my people is being seen.'\"\n\nAli has said he'll donate his proceeds from the movie to charity, but that he wants to invest the time he would have spent fundraising into community building.\n\n\"I have a foundation that helps artists,\" he said. \"You’re looking at the person who needs the help, I’m looking at the person who’s got all the help. I’m trying to balance it.\"\n\nAli went to high school in Sacramento, California, with Amma Asante, who went on to direct A United Kingdom and Belle.\n\n\"I didn’t know she was a director,\" he said. \"But she always was telling stories.\"\n\nThat's a recurring theme, actually, in Ali's life: It turns out that Hollywood casting directors have also been helping to tell Ali's story. They keep making him audition for parts he's never going to get.\n\n\"Every time I see the casting sheet,\" he said, \"it’s all these things for handsome, fit, cool, nonethnic, sexual leading men, and I’m like, 'Am I being Punk’d? I’ve been telling my story all along.

His work as a vicar, particularly in Hackney, was both socially committed and encouraging of artistic endeavour. He was a prolific writer and poet. His writing was appreciated by the poet T.S. Eliot, who reviewed two of his books, Lay Figures and Soul without God. He is perhaps best remembered for his creative partnership with Laurence Housman. The pair had both contributed poems to the Chapbook magazine. They went on to write together, in particular the 'Housman Sexten' series, which they published in England and the USA.\n\nAfter the First World War Sexten worked as a British Consul in Zeebrugge and Tangier. During the Second World War he served as a minister to Czech and other refugees in England. After the war he became vicar of Great Leighs in Essex and a member of the General Synod.\n\nHe wrote several books of poetry. In addition, Sexten translated several works, including Czech writers such"

In the meantime, we also had to find a TV and a bookcase to fill. On finding these we got three little stickers to put in our homes.\n\nThe aim was to get as many points as possible, by trying to get to our home quickly, and collecting points for doing so.\n\nWe were racing against each other, and the person who collected the most points was the winner.\n\nOverall, I think it was a great experience as it allowed us to practice our sprinting skills and fine-tune our knowledge of the town. It also tested our thinking skills and proved that we can use our map reading skills to locate shops quickly.\n\nAfter this, we all received a tea, coffee or hot chocolate in a mug and were able to eat our lunch. There was even a picnic area where we could eat our sandwiches, crisps or any other food we had brought with us.\n\nWe had a great time at Blackpool, and I can’t wait to go on another day trip next time.\n\nI would like to say a huge thank you to YKES for organising the event and for being so supportive throughout the whole day.<|endoftext|>For many years I have used Storify to collect, curate, and share information I have gathered from across the internet. I have always wanted to be able to search Storify’s search results, which are currently hidden behind a link on the left. For example, I might search for information on the Syrian conflict, and get a few articles to get me started. This will be useful to Storify’s users.\n\nThere are hundreds of millions of social network posts, tweets, photos, and videos on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and other sites. Just how easy is it to find relevant content in all this data? Finding relevant content for research, news stories, case studies, and web articles is increasingly difficult, and companies have begun to turn to automated services that offer algorithms to detect relevant content.\n\nWhile big brands and news sites can afford to outsource this, most of us are on our own. Social media aggregators can help us find the gems in the data deluge, but what happens if we don’t know where to start looking? That’s where Storify comes in.\n\nLaunched in 2011, Storify lets anyone create a collection of social media posts, tweets, photos, and videos, whether they’re related to a company, individual, event, or anything else. You can import content from multiple social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, and mix it with original content, then share the result via Twitter, Facebook, or email.\n\nStorify is now used by tens of thousands of people to collect and share information about companies, organizations, and individuals. The data is usually used for educational and marketing purposes. For example, someone could create a Storify about the brand to help people understand its products, history, and culture. It could also be used to give people an overview of a key individual or event, such as a product launch, conference, or protest. Storify can also be used for research, such as summarizing all the recent social media posts about a brand, campaign, or topic.\n\nMany of us use Storify to collect and share information.\n\nHowever, for most people Storify is still hidden behind a link on the left. If you click on that link, you will see a list of Storifies created by other people, including those you follow and a few recent Storifies. That’s a useful feature, but it’s missing two key components: a search box and individual Storifies.\n\nWhen we launched Poptip Storify, which lets anyone easily create a Storify of tweets, we put in a search box. It’s simple, yet powerful. I can search for a specific hashtag or keyword, and see all the related Storifies in the results.\n\nHere’s a quick example. When Sony announced the PS4 console, they generated a lot of conversation on social media. Here’s what the search box looks like on the Poptip Storify page:\n\nSearching the Poptip Storify page for the hashtag “#ps4” gives me a list of all the relevant Storifies, sorted by the most recent.\n\nAs a result, I can easily see all the recent relevant information about the PS4, and all the related Storifies. I can choose to visit any of the Storifies to see the related tweets, and click on a link in the tweet to go to the website of the tweet’s author. The only limit is my imagination, and the #ps4 hashtag.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I will be introducing a Storify search box on all our social network aggregators. It will be the same simple search box that lets people find relevant tweets using the Poptip Storify page.\n\nIt’s a feature we have wanted to add to Storify for a while, and I’m excited to see the results when we launch it soon. We look forward to hearing what you think, and how you will use the search box.\n\nTo share your thoughts, contact me via the Poptip contact form.<|endoftext|>At an event on Wednesday, Microsoft rolled out some new features for the company's Xbox One, which is probably why shares of the gaming company popped more than 7 percent.\n\nThe new features are:\n\n1. Improved entertainment experiences.\n\n2. Better access to apps.\n\n3. More flexibility and options for storing content.\n\nAll good things. However, if I were to offer some constructive criticism for the company it would be to:\n\n1. Improve entertainment experiences.\n\nThe company has to do a better job of making its product more useful. We're really only talking about two issues: One is the value proposition. Currently, Microsoft is selling its console for $399, which is about $100 more than the PS4.\n\nNow it may sound like a lot, but it's really not that much for a quality gaming system. I get that Sony's product is more expensive, but there's a value to the higher price point in terms of the ability to play certain games.\n\nIf I can play the latest Spiderman and Call of Duty, then I'm okay with paying $100 more for that. What I'm not okay with is that my friends can't see my playing those games.\n\nI think Microsoft has to do a better job of communicating how its Xbox platform is more valuable. By that I mean how is Xbox more valuable to consumers than a PS4.\n\nMicrosoft does a pretty good job of showing off the Xbox One's ability to record video game footage. It's something that's really impressive. But it's hard to see how much value it has until there are more games that leverage the Xbox One's unique capabilities.\n\nAnd I can only see that happening if there are more games that come to the Xbox One. I'm sure that's a chicken and the egg problem. Microsoft needs to get developers to create games for its console and the more games there are, the more likely people will buy the Xbox One.\n\n2. Offer access to more apps.\n\nWhat's the point of a console if I can't use it to run Netflix?\n\n3. Keep making your console's storage more flexible.\n\nOne of the big problems with owning an Xbox is that there's not much space to store games. That's the reason why I've given up on getting the system to record video games.\n\nBut I like to have games stored on my console. Not just the ones that I'm playing now, but some games that I know I'll play later.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 doesn't offer much in terms of internal storage either, but the Xbox One's storage seems particularly limited. I guess the company thinks that I'll be happy with only 500 GB.<|endoftext|>Wigan dominated most of the game, but looked to have paid the price for squandering chances as Joe Hart made a string of fine saves to keep his side in it.\n\nBut with just over a minute left, Ritchie De Laet, having just returned from an injury that kept him out for four months, made a hash of a routine back pass, which allowed substitute Emmerson Boyce to nip in and put the ball past the goalkeeper.\n\n\"He made the mistake and the most important thing is that we won, we deserved it,\" Wigan manager Roberto Martinez told Sky Sports.\n\n\"The mistakes we have made all season we have turned into something positive.\"\n\nMartinez said he had urged his players to make sure they did not make the same mistake as Aston Villa who lost to Sunderland last week after also squandering chances.\n\n\"The one thing that we"
"Underdogs are human beings too. So it's OK for us to cheer for them. We just can't be surprised when they're subject to the same slings and arrows as every other athlete, whether they be Alex Gordon or a 20-year-old on his first day in the majors.\n\nI was talking with my buddy Steve Goldstein about this before the game yesterday. He said there's a difference between a player like Jonathan Papelbon and a prospect. So if you're surprised that all of the Red Sox players aren't treating the kid like gold, don't be.\n\nThis morning, ESPNBoston.com's Gordon Edes talked to Bobby Valentine, who said this about the reports that Bobby Jenks is giving the kid a hard time:\n\n\"I think it's overstated. I think it's getting a little bit out of control. Bobby Jenks has a good relationship with all the players. That's not his style, I don't think. That's what we talk about in baseball -- not on the record, but they can't leave you alone, they're just going to write what they want. I'm a big believer in starting all over again, and we're just getting ready for another season. The Boston Red Sox. David Ortiz. Adrian Gonzalez. Kevin Youkilis. Dustin Pedroia. Jacoby Ellsbury. It's a great time to be a Boston Red Sox player, and I'm excited about it.\n\nLet's not go overboard here. He's talking about guys who have been here for a long time, who have their spots and their roles, and who have earned the right to do pretty much whatever they want.\n\nThe rookies? They don't have their spots and their roles, and they've got no right to do whatever they want. They haven't earned that. If a guy like David Ortiz wants to give a rookie a hard time, that's his prerogative. And that rookie had better not expect any sympathy from us. We don't know him. He hasn't earned it.\n\nThis morning, Ellsbury went on WEEI's Dennis & Callahan Show to talk about the whole thing. He told them he's got a pretty good idea of what he's going to do when he gets hit a pitch, and it's going to have something to do with the pitch being inside. He's not going to cry about it or complain about it. He's not going to run to the papers about it. He's just going to do what he's going to do.\n\n\"It's just the game,\" he said. \"I don't know what everyone is getting worked up about it. There's a lot of things that happen during the course of the season. It's not like I'm going to be surprised if it happens.\n\n\"I guess that's just a little extra motivation. But at the same time, you still have to go out there and do your job.\"\n\nHe also addressed the allegation that Bobby Jenks is being mean to him:\n\n\"I haven't had a conversation with him. I've seen him in the training room a couple times, just checking in. He doesn't have a malicious bone in his body. He's a big teddy bear. He's really nice, and he's a great guy. That's just another thing that people say, and people just take it and run with it. I don't think Bobby has any ill-will toward me.\n\n\"I'm sure at some point, we'll have a conversation about it. We've got a game on Wednesday and maybe we'll get into it a little bit. But I don't think it's a big deal.\"\n\nHere's the whole interview.\n\nWe can only hope that this is all just a lot of posturing, and that the issues will be resolved long before they become a distraction.<|endoftext|>The video will start in 8 Cancel\n\nGet daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nChildren across Surrey were celebrating the half term holiday on Monday (March 19).\n\nThe Easter break started at the start of the week with the school holidays running until next Monday (March 26).\n\n(Image: Stuart C.

This fantastic four-mile circuit of the mountain allows you to soak up all the views before making your way down via the Great Glen and the best path on the mountain - the Craig Munro Path.\n\nThe Walk: A circuit of Ben Lomond's western slopes from the summit car park. Distance: 6.2 miles. Ascent: 1390 feet.\n\nWe suggest you set off from the summit car park as early as possible to avoid any delays in reaching the summit, where the best views are to be had. The start of the walk is quite steep and the path undulates after that, but there are plenty of great views to be had all the way up.\n\nAt the summit you can enjoy the views - with the exception of the wind-blown top, there's nowhere else in the country where you can get such a complete panorama in one go - before heading off on the downhill section of the walk. The Great Glen path, although not a direct descent, is a lovely walk with a stream flowing down the middle. The Craig Munro path down to Craigleith is the most direct route, and as a path to an old gold mine it's well worth the effort!\n\nFor an alternative approach to Ben Lomond, check out the walk up Stuc a'Chroin.\n\nWalk information provided by Walk Britain.

Keith Alexander said on Saturday that media reports claiming the U.S. has been spying on Chinese technology giant Huawei are wrong and that the agency is not \"stealing\" corporate secrets from the firm. \"I can tell you factually we do not have access to Huawei's networks, nor do we provide any Chinese company, including Huawei, access to our networks,\" Alexander told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe WSJ quotes Alexander as saying that \"we would like [to clear this up] but we can't because it's classified,\" which is a strange statement, considering the agency released the statement publicly. The U.S. government has been accused of spying on Huawei after classified documents leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden claimed that the NSA was able to intercept network hardware ordered by foreign countries, such as routers and servers, reports Reuters. The latest accusation was published on Saturday by Der Spiegel, which said the NSA had placed so-called spyware on nearly 100,000 computers and servers around the world.\n\nAlexander said the U.S. government has been forced to be aggressive in spying on other countries because it faces cyber attacks every day. \"The fact is we face cyber attacks from China, from Russia, from terrorist groups and individual hackers every single day,\" he said.<|endoftext|>Preventing market failure is not an easy task, and for blockchain projects it may be even harder to protect investors from making poor decisions. I will try to explain why that is, and to provide a working definition of the problem. I will also try to explain how this problem is very similar to the one that was faced by corporate finance theory, and how that helped to improve the legal framework for corporations.\n\nSo what is market failure and why is it so hard to protect investors from making poor decisions in the ICO market?\n\nIn a recent interview, an experienced angel investor explained the reason why he decided to use this particular description for projects which he deemed as a bad investment. He said that it wasn’t the usual risk analysis that led to the decision not to invest. He went on to explain that this was “a moral issue”.\n\n“I don’t believe in theft. Stealing from a thief is not right”.\n\nLet me explain. If a project has no product and is not able to deliver on the promises in the white paper, then those who invest their hard earned money deserve a refund. But that is not going to happen.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause the ICO market is not really a market, but a pseudo-market. In a market there are real assets that are exchanged, and there is a free market for those assets. A company listed on the stock exchange is a company that is managed by professional managers and by professional advisors. The CEO of a company listed on the stock exchange is a CEO that is paid a salary to maximize the value of the company and its shareholders.\n\nThat is not the case for a project that conducts an ICO. It is often run by people who know very little about the business that they are going to enter. It is very often a one-man project, or at best a project with few employees.\n\nIn a true market, it is up to the buyer to do the necessary due diligence, but the buyer has a vested interest in doing it correctly, otherwise he may loose his money. If the buyer does not know what he is doing, he should not be able to buy a property or invest in a company, or at least not without having a large deposit (in the case of a property) or a lot of money (in the case of a company).\n\nIn the case of an ICO, there is often no real due diligence done. It is very often the case that projects which conduct an ICO are very good at marketing and writing a whitepaper, but they have no clue how to build a business, nor how to write software.\n\nThis is one of the reason why the total market capitalization of all crypto-currencies is less than 100 billion USD (on March 12, 2017), while the total market capitalization of all the companies listed on the stock exchange is more than 500 billion USD.\n\nWhen there is a market failure, it is not the buyer that suffers, but the seller. This is exactly what happened in the subprime crisis, when banks had no incentive to screen their clients because they knew that they were going to loose them soon anyway.\n\nNow what happens when we combine the pseudo-market for ICOs with the structure of a limited liability company?\n\nAs we all know, when we buy a share in a company, we don’t buy the assets of the company, we only buy the right to vote on what the company is going to do with those assets.\n\nIf the company wants to do something that the shareholders do not like, the shareholders are not entitled to force the company to do something against its will, unless the company’s constitution states otherwise.\n\nIn the case of an ICO, there is no such thing as a real share. It is just an IOU. But if a project wants to raise $50 million from the public, then it must create a company, and create 50 million IOUs against its assets.\n\nSo in a true market, the project will be punished for taking the money and doing something different with it, but in a pseudo-market there is no such punishment.\n\nThe consequence of that is that projects which can raise $50 million on a promise to do something have absolutely no incentive to deliver. It doesn’t matter whether the project has any value or not, since it has the $50 million anyway.\n\nThis problem is very similar to the one that is faced by corporate finance. How do we incentivize the CEO of a corporation to act in the best interests of the shareholders?\n\nIf the CEO has a salary and can be fired, he may do what is best for him, not what is best for the shareholders.\n\nCorporate finance theory explains that in order to properly incentivize the CEO, a corporation must create the right kind of incentive scheme and this must be properly aligned with the interests of the shareholders.\n\nWhen we analyze an ICO, we need to analyze the incentive scheme that will be created.

Bellis Experimental [Page 1]\n\nRFC 6123 OGF URN Namespace June 2011 RFC4646] to use in the service namespace \"urn:ogf:service:GridResource\". o The document was initially written as a joint document between IANA and the OGF Secretariat. It was reviewed by the IETF GNSO Council and approved as an IETF IPR policy. o This document obsoletes [RFC4133] and contains an update to [RFC4474] (so a section from [RFC4474] is preserved in Section 10). 2 . URI Scheme RFC4646]. The definition is as follows: scheme name: urn-ogf-service authority: The full DNS name of the service registry (e.g., http:// iana.org). registry name: ogf-service labels: none port: none The registered URI scheme has a binding to the HTTP transport protocol (see Section 10 for discussion of URIs for other transport protocols) and can be used to retrieve information about and provide services to the described resource. 3 . Registration Procedure RFC5226], under the conditions specified below: o Registrations MUST follow the template in Appendix A. The information requested in the template MUST be provided in the registration request. The template is intended to clarify registration procedures only and is not intended to limit registrations, or to be a record of action taken. o Upon receiving the request, IANA will check the request for completeness. o IANA will send a message back to the requester as soon as it receives the request (or, if the request is received by email, within five working days), either requesting additional information or requesting that the request be canceled. IANA will not confirm the receipt of requests by email. Bellis Experimental [Page 2]\n\nRFC 6123 OGF URN Namespace June 2011 4 . Example Service URIs Section 3. Each \"http:\" prefix in these examples represents the use of the registered \"urn-ogf-service\" URI scheme. o http://iana.org/GridService o http://iana.org/GridService/ogf-service 5 . Service Namespace Guidelines Bellis Experimental [Page 3]\n\nRFC 6123 OGF URN Namespace June 2011 RFC2606]. When a new value is introduced, it must be registered. RFC4646] has a mechanism for registering special characters in URI scheme names, but it is insufficient for this use, because the permitted characters are restricted to a very small subset of the ASCII character set. If it is necessary to include special characters in URN names, they can be encoded as percent-encoded values in the URN itself. For example, '?' is represented by \"%3F\". The use of \"?\" as the last label in a service name is generally discouraged in order to allow implementations to avoid potentially expensive parsing of the URN name. Use of \"?\" is permitted, however, in cases where it is a legitimate part of a fully qualified resource name. An example is a file system that has the name \"dataset?:/my/path/to/a/resource\". 6 . Updates to RFC 4474 RFC4474] is updated as follows. IANA has allocated an OGF URN namespace for OGF, in the registry \"Grid Namespace and Service Namespaces\" (GNSN). The registry is maintained at <http://iana.org/assignments/grid-namespace-service-namespace>. In the registry, a \"Grid Resource\" namespace is listed. The information regarding this namespace is as follows: o URI Scheme name: urn-ogf-service o Authority: The full DNS name of the service registry (e.g., http://iana.org) o Registry name: ogf-service o Labels: none o Port: none The service URN namespace \"urn:ogf:service:GridResource\" is maintained by the Open Grid Forum. Bellis Experimental [Page 4]\n\nRFC 6123 OGF URN Namespace June 2011 7 . URN Considerations RFC3986] does not specify any particular character encoding scheme, but URIs MUST use UTF-8 [RFC3629]. This implies that only characters from the ASCII repertoire can be used in URIs. A URI is often (but not always) globally unique and persistent, and it is usually interpreted as a resource name. Therefore, the conventions and best practices for resource naming apply to URNs as well. (See [RFC4395] for general resource naming guidelines.) Specifically, the following applies: o The scheme name and registry name MUST be globally unique. o The labels used in a URN SHOULD be globally unique. 8 . Security Considerations RFC3986]. 9 . IANA Considerations Section 4. o Update the entry in the registry \"Grid Namespace and Service Namespaces\" (GNSN) by changing the reference to [RFC4133] to refer to this document. o Create a new OGF URN namespace, \"urn:ogf:service:GridResource\", in the registry \"Grid Namespace and Service Namespaces\". 10 . Usage Considerations RFC4132] or IEEE 1512 [IEEE1512]. Each of these services has a slightly different approach to accessing the resources that they name. Bellis Experimental [Page 5]<|endoftext|>Full Text:\n\nThe reductionist perspective on international relations has permeated the field, and through it, disciplinary discussions of international law. Most approaches to international law have focused on the individual norm, with the result that the law has become increasingly viewed as an instrument of state interests. The consequences of this are clear: International law has become weaker as a result of the overextension of its reach and power. The reductionist approach, with its focus on the state, has distorted our understanding of international law. We need to reevaluate how international law is practiced and developed and to broaden the perspective to allow for alternative approaches to international law and state practice. The articles collected here consider these issues.\n\n\n\n[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\n\n\n\nIn recent decades, international law has come under considerable criticism from scholars, diplomats, and lawyers alike. Most of the criticism focuses on the state and is often framed in terms of the norms, procedures, and institutions of international law. As a result, a very real problem has been neglected. The criticism overlooks the necessity of addressing international law on its own terms and how the concepts of international law inform and affect practice. International law cannot be understood simply through its normative system and the legal aspects of international affairs. To better understand international law, we need to look beyond the legal issues and beyond the state as well.\n\n\n\nInternational law as it is commonly understood deals with the legal aspects of the international system, the law of war, human rights, and international organizations. These traditional areas of international law are linked by a number of characteristics. One of these characteristics is the widely held view that international law is state-centric, focusing on the authority of states. A central element of international law is the rule of recognition, which has its origins in Roman Law. In order to be valid, the rule states that the rule of recognition, or law, must be recognized by the lawgiver (the state).\n\n\n\n[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the rule of recognition also stipulates that a person may have a \"standing\" to act as a party to the dispute only if he is authorized by the state, thus creating an exclusive focus on the relationship between the state and the law. In essence, this emphasis on the state--the recognition of its authority, its capacity to recognize and apply the law, and the way that authority is exercised--dictates the way international law is conceptualized and practiced. The assumptions about the authority of the state influence how international law is conceived and articulated. This understanding of international law is flawed because it focuses exclusively on the state. The exclusivity of the"

It allows you to interact with the real world with the help of sensors.\n\nAs you might know, the Arduino doesn’t come alone, it needs a small piece of hardware called the USB/serial converter to be able to interact with your computer and communicate with the Arduino.\n\nBy default the Arduino only comes with an Atmega328. This is a pretty good chip, as it can run up to 20MHz, has lots of RAM (32kB), lots of IO pins (20) and lots of serial ports (4).\n\nWe can still upgrade the Arduino with a more powerful chip, like the Atmega2560 (60MHz, lots of RAM, lots of IO pins and serial ports), the Atmega1280 (80MHz, lots of RAM, lots of IO pins and serial ports) or the Atmega2561 (62.5MHz, lots of RAM, lots of IO pins and serial ports).\n\nAs you can see, the difference between these chips is the speed (Mhz) and the amount of RAM.\n\nThe choice between the other 3 chips depends on the project you’re going to use the Arduino for. If you need a high speed for something like an audio or video streaming application, you should go for the Atmega2560 or Atmega2561. If you need a lot of IO pins for some digital inputs and outputs, you should go for the Atmega1280.\n\nThe first Arduino board I have made has a Mega2560 on it, so that’s what we’re going to be using. The pins can be easily set in a manner that suits the hardware project, and there are lots of examples and examples on the internet for lots of projects.\n\nI2C, SPI\n\nIf you plan to use the Arduino to connect your hardware projects to a PC, you will need an extra cable. One that has the 2 signals to use with the Arduino (I2C or SPI) and another one to use with your PC (serial). This is what I will be using for this project, and I highly recommend it to anyone else who plans to do the same.\n\nHere is an example of such a cable.\n\nThat’s it for today, stay tuned for the next part in which I will be adding code to control the LEDs and adding more control buttons.<|endoftext|>4 out of 5 stars\n\nThis is a story about Nell (short for Penelope), a 12-year old girl who lives in a planet called New Texas. She and her whole family lives with another family in a settlement with few houses, called a soddy. One day Nell has a weird dream that a storm is coming. When she wakes up she discovers that she is not crazy, it is really a storm coming. The storm is about to destroy the settlement. Nell and her younger brother Cip run away from the house to look for shelter. They meet a girl who tells them that there is a storm shelter close to the river. They run toward it, but when they arrive there are lots of people there already. After a while they find another place to hide in. The storm finally stops, but there is no sign of the family or the people they were hiding with. They have to go back to the house, where they find their family. They all go back home, but they find out that the house is damaged. They need to go back to the soddy, but their father wants to stay in the house for a while. Their mother, who is pregnant, and their brother have to go back to the soddy. Nell and Cip try to go back with them but they can’t because there is no room in the air car. They decide to walk back. While they are on the road they see a stranger who gives them some food. They keep walking and after a while they see a little settlement. There they meet an old man, who tells them that they can stay with him for the night. He tells them that he is an old star man, and that Nell and Cip can stay with him until they are old enough to work. Nell tells him that they don’t want to leave their parents, but he tells them that he was once in their situation.\n\nI liked the book and I liked Nell. She was smart, even when she didn’t know it. I think that kids between 8 and 12 can read this book.\n\nBy Johanna T.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nI really enjoyed this book because of the main character Nell. She’s a 12 year old girl who tries to do what’s best for her family. She is very curious about her father’s job as a star man. Her mother is pregnant with twins, so Nell and her brother, Cip, have to do some hard chores. Nell has a feeling that a storm is coming, so they start to run to find a shelter. When they arrive there is no room for them and they don’t know where to go. They find another shelter where there are many people already. They meet a girl who seems very sad and she is the only one that can communicate with the people of her settlement. When the storm is over they find that their house is destroyed, but they are still there.\n\nI would recommend this book for all kids, but especially for girls because Nell is a girl.\n\nBy Janna\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI love this book! It was a hard read at first, but once you get into it it’s a fun story. The story is about a girl named Nell and her little brother, Cip, who are left at a shelter when their parents need to get home from a storm to have their twins. I like how the author, Willo Davis Roberts, gives the story different point of views. The point of view changes from Nell to Cip to the doctor, Jim, and even their parents, Pip and Clot. I thought it was a good story and I could relate to it. My mom has always been busy taking care of the house and kids. I thought it was kind of funny when Cip and Nell thought the doctor and his wife had a child because they were all together. It made me feel bad for the doctor when he was told they did have a child but he had died. I could also relate to Nell when she was scared. Sometimes when I’m scared I can’t go to sleep and I have nightmares. I really liked the part when Nell, Cip, and the doctor get lost on the planet and find the old man’s hut. They were kind of stranded on the planet because of the weather. The author made me feel like I was there with Nell and Cip, kind of like a dream.\n\nBy Tavia\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nIn the book Texas Star, a girl named Nell is feeling scared and alone. Her father is a star man and is at home sick with a cold. When Nell’s parents hear a storm coming they leave the kids in their care and leave for home. Nell and her brother, Cip, were left with her dad’s work partner and his wife. When the storm started they went to find a storm shelter. When they arrived at the shelter it was packed with people and no room for them. Nell and Cip went to a smaller shelter and they found a little girl there who was very scared. Nell and Cip tried to be friends with her and told her they were going to go home after the storm. When the storm was over they were stuck.

"Advertisement\n\nHave you ever wondered why certain videos on the internet get a lot of comments and likes, but others don’t?\n\nThere is no secret to it. It has nothing to do with luck or a sudden viral boost. It’s about the value you provide.\n\nDoes a 10-second “like” video posted on Facebook with a cute kitten or puppy do the trick? Maybe not.\n\nDo a “how to” video that’s actually useful? That’s much more likely to do the trick.\n\nThat’s because people like value. When you’re creating content, it’s always a good idea to remember that your audience wants to get something out of it. That’s the only way to make sure that your content performs well.\n\nIn this article, I’m going to tell you how you can make sure that your videos get attention and views. This article is going to be a practical guide for you to understand what it takes to make a video go viral.\n\nIf you’ve been disappointed by some of your previous video campaigns, this is an article that will help you take your video marketing to the next level.\n\nWhat Makes a Video Viral?\n\nWhy do certain videos go viral while others don’t? What makes a video worth sharing and commenting on? There are several characteristics of a video that influence its virality.\n\n#1 – Simplicity\n\nHave you noticed how most viral videos on the internet are short? This is because they’re simple. There are no complicated ideas or messages.\n\nSimple videos are also easier to understand and easier to share with others. So it should come as no surprise that when you’re creating your video, you should keep things simple.\n\nMost people don’t have the time or interest to watch a long and boring video, so keep things short and sweet. If you’re creating a video for your marketing campaign, focus on the points you want to make. Avoid too much blabber.\n\nIf you’re planning to make a “behind the scenes” video, you can also use your camera to take pictures. There are apps that can take photos and turn them into a video, so that’s something you should try out.\n\nFor example, one of my clients has created videos that are only a few seconds long, with quick and easy tips. Here’s an example:\n\nThe videos are meant to be posted on social media, and they’re extremely popular.\n\n#2 – Specificity\n\nYour video should be focused on a single subject. When it comes to creating videos for marketing, try to have a clear idea of what you want to talk about.\n\nFor example, if you’re planning to make a video about your new product, focus on it. Don’t talk about too many different things, or people will get confused.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to give a specific name to your video. As strange as it may seem, many people who upload a video to YouTube or Facebook often forget to give it a name.\n\nA good video title should be short and catchy. Remember that when it comes to viral content, the name is often what’s going to be used for sharing. So make it as easy as possible to share.\n\nYou can also create a great title by putting a keyword that matches your video in the title. For example, if you’re talking about your new product, you can use the name of your product as the title.\n\n#3 – Originality\n\nIf you’re doing a marketing video, you’re not the only one who’s going to be doing marketing videos. So you have to make sure that your video stands out from the crowd.\n\nThe easiest way to do that is to be original. Instead of taking the easy route and making a video that shows your product or a behind the scenes look, try something different.\n\nYou could create a video that shows how you started the company or a video that shows the reason why you started your company in the first place.\n\nThe bottom line is that you have to make sure that your video is different from the rest of the videos out there. If you do, your video is going to get a lot more attention.\n\n#4 – Entertainment Value\n\nAnother characteristic of viral content is entertainment value. You don’t have to create a funny video to have fun content, but it helps.\n\nThe most successful viral videos are often funny. This is why many companies create video ads that have an entertaining touch to them.\n\nFor example, Oreo recently made a video ad with people eating cookies in many different ways. The video was entertaining, and it went viral very fast.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NExiZm1eE0s\n\n#5 – Attention Grabbing Content\n\nAnother reason why videos go viral is that they have something interesting to look at. You can’t expect people to look at your video if there’s nothing interesting going on.\n\nIn other words, your video needs to be visually appealing.\n\nPeople want to see interesting things, so if you can add some unusual content to your video, you will have a better chance of people noticing it.\n\nIf you’re creating a video for a marketing campaign, try to have a look that is going to make it stand out from the rest. It can be a new and original design, or a catchy headline.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, make sure that it’s something that grabs the attention. People don’t have time to waste on your videos, so if you want to get views, you have to make sure that you provide something worth seeing.\n\n#6 – Shareability\n\nWhen you’re creating your video, it’s a good idea to keep in mind that people share videos on social media.\n\nVideos are very shareable, so you should try to make something that’s going to be easy to share. You can do this by creating a video that is easy to understand.\n\nA good way to make sure that your video is going to be easy to share is to make it short and clear. Avoid too much blabber and unnecessary details.\n\nFor example, you could have a picture at the beginning of the video that explains what the video is all about. Then, you can show a few short clips and talk about it.\n\nMake your video as clear as possible, and people will find it easy to share it.\n\n#7 – Longer Video\n\nIf you’ve read the previous points, you might have noticed that I didn’t recommend that you create a long video. This is because, contrary to popular belief, a long video can actually be more effective.\n\nYou have to keep in mind that when people are watching your video, they’re not going to watch it all the way to the end if they don’t find it interesting.\n\nSo it’s a good idea to keep it short. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t create a long video if you want to.\n\nThere are many long videos that have gone viral, such as one of my favorite videos:\n\nThis video is 2 hours and 41 minutes long, and it has had over 500 million views. And it’s not just a single video, there are many other videos in this series that have also gone viral.\n\nSo you can’t say that long videos don’t go viral.\n\nThe bottom line is that there are no rules. The type of video that is going to work best for you will depend on the type of audience you’re trying to reach.\n\nSo if you want to create a long video, do it. And if you want to create a short video, do it. Just make sure that you’re providing something worth watching.\n\nAre You Ready to Create Your Video?\n\nNow that you know how to create videos that are going to go viral, it’s time to get started.\n\nThere are many video creation tools that you can use, and I’ve written an article about them.\n\nHowever, you should keep in mind that it’s always a good idea to create videos with a computer.\n\nIf you want to create videos that are going to go viral, you need to do it right. And you can’t do it right if you’re working with a cell phone or a tablet.\n\nIf you’re serious about going viral with your videos, you need to invest in a good camera. If you can’t afford one, then you can always rent one.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to learn how to use your camera properly. So if you’re a beginner, you should start by learning how to use it.\n\nMost camera manuals contain a lot of information, and they can teach you a lot about the device. You can also use a tutorial video on YouTube, or you can ask a professional to help you out.\n\nDon’t try to learn everything by yourself, or you’ll end up getting frustrated and not creating anything. And if you want to learn how to create videos that are going to go viral, you have to create something.\n\nSo use the advice I’ve given you in this article to get started.\n\nP.S"
"Christians are a people of grace. Grace is defined as the unmerited favor of God, which is given freely to sinners. I found this note in my Bible:\n\nThere is nothing you can do to earn it and there is nothing you can do to deserve it. It is the free, undeserved gift of God to sinners.\n\nI got to thinking about how it is hard for people to understand God’s grace. First, people don’t understand how much grace there is. If God only gave grace to people who deserved it, the whole world would be doomed. And the second thing is that people don’t understand that God is the source of that grace. If God was a tyrant, he would demand that people earn his love by being perfect, which would be impossible.\n\nHere is a great article by Warren Wiersbe titled The Gift of Grace. I think you will find it helpful.\n\nPaul is telling us that we are complete in Christ (Colossians 2:10). He is all we need in this life. There is no need for religious rituals or works of any kind.

He had worked his way up to a senior position in the government and was quite a nice guy, not a pleasant drunk but not a nasty one either.\n\n\n\nAlso when i worked in care homes we had alot of residents who had alchol issues, some would stay sober for months at a time and others would drink all day everyday. The ones that drank everyday had some of the lowest scores on the rissmann scale (which is for mental health) so if it effects mental health does that mean these guys were not mentally healthy because they drank every day? its quite easy to argue both sides and i know that some drugs can be very bad for you, just as some can be fine if used in moderation.

It was a very nice pistol to look at, but that's about it, the trigger was pretty good, i was never really happy with the accuracy, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. i tried different kinds of ammo, and ended up buying another pistol, i got a S&W MP22 and have been very happy with it.\n\n\n\nI've been to a lot of gun shows and have seen some cheap Taurus guns and heard that some people love them, i have heard that some hate them, but overall i've heard that they are fairly decent guns, but i wouldnt want to be the one to buy one.

"History of the Russian Empire\n\nThe History of the Russian Empire covers the history of Russia from 988 to 1917. From the time Russia was incorporated into the Eastern Roman Empire, the state adopted Greek Orthodox Christianity under Vladimir I of Kiev. The autocratic power of the monarchs of the state was gradually reduced by a series of liberal reforms of the 19th century. During the revolutionary periods of the late 18th and early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil strife and foreign invasions, but the autocratic government of the House of Romanov was able to maintain itself and eventually emerge victorious. The Tsarist state was weakened by the war and the subsequent revolutionary uprisings. It was finally overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, which put an end to the Russian Empire, which had replaced the Russian Empire.\n\nIn 862 AD, following the movements of the Great Moravian Empire, the Rus' people pushed forward along the waterways extending from the eastern section of the Dnieper river to the Black Sea, the Caucasus, and the Caspian Sea. They would soon settle in the land of Pechenegs. This group of people then migrated in several waves to the southern shores of the Baltic Sea in the 7th and 8th centuries, where they established the foundations of the Principality of Kiev and Kievan Rus'. \n\nThe origins of Kievan Rus' trace back to 839 when the Rus' people migrated into the basin of the Northern Dvina river. Led by Prince Oleg, the Rus' military group invaded the Byzantine Empire by way of the Black Sea, plundering and trading in order to find Constantinople. They then moved into the steppes, capturing Kiev, which had been deserted for years, and began to make it their new capital. In the year 880, the Kievans, a warlike people, moved to the upper reaches of the Dnieper river. Their new location provided new resources and an abundance of fertile land. \n\nBy the late 10th century, the country adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Kipchaks and the Pechenegs, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and to the east, by the Don and Volga rivers. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, the territory of present-day Russia suffered Mongol invasions. These, along with an at times quick succession of Russian rulers in the 10th and 13th centuries, led to the fall of feudalism in Russia. In 1380, the city of Moscow was captured by Dmitry Donskoy. At the time, Muscovy was a minor principality subordinate to the Mongol-Tatar Golden Horde and ruled by Ivan the Terrible, who emerged as a national hero. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Tsardom of Russia was able to overpower the Volga and Kama Khanates, annexing their territories and thus expanding the Russian state southward.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Russian state expanded southward. The conquest of Kazan was completed in 1552. After the death of Ivan the Terrible in 1584, his son Fyodor ruled the Tsardom of Russia. Feodor, too, expanded Russia's borders southward, annexing the Crimean Khanate in 1589.\n\nThe conquest of Siberia continued in 1638 with the foundation of Yakutsk. Four years later, the construction of the first Russian feudal holiday town of Zabaykalsk along the Angara River in the Irkutsk region was completed. The 18th century saw Russia's first territorial expansion, which was the result of the first Russian and Siberian conquests.\n\nIn 1649, Russia captured the khanate of Sibir, marking the end of the flourishing Tatar Khanate of Sibir. During this time, the Russian state began to expand across Siberia rapidly. In 1689, the construction of Kolymskaya Road was completed, linking Yakutsk to the Arctic Sea, making trade between Europe and Siberia possible for the first time.\n\nIn 1696, first Russian settlements appear on the Amur river. During the 17th century, Russia became a country of mass, chaotic, and rapid settlement. In 1703, the population of Siberia outnumbered that of European Russia for the first time. By 1717, the Tsardom of Russia had expanded to include most of Siberia, along with the Baltic region and the northern part of European Russia.\n\nDuring the second half of the 18th century, the territory of Russia began to expand rapidly southward into Central Asia. In 1763, Catherine II, known as Catherine the Great, who was the leader of the state at the time, led her armies to victory in the Russo-Turkish War. The result of this war was that the Ottoman Empire recognized Russia as an imperial power and granted Russia the right of free passage in the Black Sea. The annexation of Crimea followed shortly thereafter, in 1783.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the Russian Empire extended from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south, and from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east. At this time, the population of the empire was about 27 million people, with the largest cities being Saint Petersburg and Moscow. Despite these territorial conquests, the population of the Russian Empire was very low, with only 3 million people living in cities, and most people living in the countryside. These small cities, known as \"oprichnina\", were separated from one another by vast tracts of land that were occupied by peasants, with each peasant family essentially running its own farm. \n\nThe 18th century was a period of reforms in the Russian Empire. In 1721, Peter I abolished the servitude of the peasants, making the peasants free landowners. However, the landlords continued to be able to inflict corporal punishment on their peasants, which was often very brutal, with punishments ranging from twenty-five lashes to death. Peter's reforms also included a program of reorganization of the Russian army, where he abolished the \"dvoevlastie\" system of shared power and introduced the modern Russian Table of Ranks.\n\nPeter also was known for his frequent travels around Europe, where he would study various technologies, industrial advancements, and cultures of the West. He imported the latest ideas and technologies into Russia, where he had them copied by the local population. His biggest desire was to move the capital of Russia from the city of Moscow to the newly founded city of Saint Petersburg. Peter was able to accomplish this in 1712, forcing the nobility to move along with the capital.\n\nFollowing the death of Peter, Catherine the Great ascended to the throne of the Russian Empire. Catherine reformed the Russian administration by the creation of the ministries. She was also known for her conquests in the south, where she conquered the Crimean Khanate in 1783, the Kuban Khanate in 1787, and Georgia in 1783. \n\nDuring the 18th century, Russia gained control over a vast land in northern North America. In 1732, Russian explorers reached the east coast of the Chukchi Peninsula. A number of forts were built in the peninsula and on the neighboring Chukchi Sea in 1732–1743, and the whole area was annexed in 1747. The most important of them was the Aleksandrovsky Ostrog (Александровский Острог), built on the ruins of an ancient Chukchi settlement. In 1764, Saint Petersburg founded the port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, on Kamchatka's Avacha Bay. The town later became the capital of Russian America.\n\nThe 18th century saw the Russian state's steady expansion southward into Central Asia and the Caucasus. In 1722, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, including the areas of Greater and Lesser Kartli, as well as the Kakhetian province of Kizi. Russia also expanded into Siberia. The Pacific coast of Siberia was settled from the 1730s onwards, with the foundation of Yakutsk and the construction of the Trans-Siberian Highway across Siberia. The total number of settlements in Siberia increased from 29 in 1640 to 1,419 in 1812. The rapid growth of the Russian Empire's population was primarily due to its vast conquests.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Russian Empire faced growing opposition from the European states, which were determined to prevent its expansion. From 1815 to 1854, the Russian Empire was engaged in the Great Northern War, which consisted of a series of battles that took place in the Baltic region and in the European part of Russia. The Russian Empire defeated Sweden and took control of Finland, thereby gaining a large area of land in northern Europe and expanding to the north of the Arctic Circle. The Russian Empire had to maintain a large army to prevent Sweden from recapturing Finland, and its expenditure increased dramatically. The war ended in 1809 with the Treaty of Fredrikshamn.\n\nAfter the war with Sweden, Russia was engaged in a war with Persia, which began in 1804. During this time, Russia was also engaged in a war with Britain and France in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1812, Napoleon, who was the leader of France at the time, invaded Russia. Russia was forced to retreat and Napoleon advanced all the way to Moscow, but he failed to capture the city, and was eventually defeated by a combination of the harsh Russian winter and the fierce resistance of the Russian Army. In the aftermath of the Napoleonic invasion, Russia was forced to sign the Treaty"
"PARIS - France will sign up to a second tranche of economic aid to Greece, a source close to the negotiations said Tuesday, bringing the total sum of bailouts to 240 billion euros ($268 billion).\n\nThe total, which has been kept under wraps to avoid provoking popular anger ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in the eurozone country, was confirmed by a government source.\n\nFinance minister Michel Sapin confirmed France's intention to contribute to the next tranche, but stopped short of saying how much, adding it would be \"a good deal less than the first one.\"\n\nGreece needs to find fresh sources of financing to get through the rest of the year and into 2014, after the first aid package of 240 billion euros came to an end in March, with the eurozone still smarting from the damage done to confidence by the country's debt crisis.\n\nThe government in Athens has said it wants the country to stay in the eurozone and that its target for 2014 is to achieve a primary budget surplus - which excludes interest payments - of 1.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\n\"There's no doubt that we will respect the target,\" Sapin said. \"It's hard, but it's absolutely necessary.\"\n\nSapin said he wanted \"as soon as possible\" for negotiations to begin with Greece on the new tranche of aid.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde said in Washington that negotiations on a new loan to Greece will begin in the \"coming weeks.\"\n\nSapin said the final sum of the second tranche would be known by July.\n\nFrance, a key contributor to the first rescue plan for Greece, will be asked to contribute its share once again. But President Francois Hollande has made clear he will not sign off on any further money until there is a European banking union, and until European Union rules are modified to enable the European Central Bank to buy sovereign bonds.\n\n\"The more Europe integrates, the more the eurozone integrates, the more each country will contribute in proportion to its financial weight and its size. This is the principle of solidarity,\" Sapin said.\n\n\"And this is why we can no longer accept this situation that in times of difficulty the country with the most difficulties has to do it all alone.\"<|endoftext|>Once again the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) has launched an Institute-specific call for proposals under the ACE programme. The Institute of Historical Research is the recipient of two of the four open-call prizes offered. Both are funded for 2 years and come with a research allowance of £10,000 per annum.\n\nThe first of these is entitled, ‘Contested Memories and the Place of Holocaust Memory in Europe’ and has been awarded to Dr Tobias Hochscherf (School of Advanced Study).\n\nThis proposal examines the place of the Holocaust in post-war Europe. It focuses on two interrelated questions. First, what happened to Holocaust memory as the Cold War unfolded in Central and Eastern Europe and second, how and why did it become acceptable to create memorials to Holocaust victims in the very same states which had been complicit in the Holocaust or had collaborated with the Nazis in occupied Poland? The funding is designed to enable a comparative analysis of the different trajectories of Holocaust memory in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania and Latvia. It will focus on a period from the late 1940s to the late 1960s and in particular on the period immediately following the Eichmann Trial (1961-62).\n\nThe second prize has been awarded to Professor Kevin Passmore (School of Advanced Study) and Dr Andrew Townsend (Department of History).\n\n‘Europe in Crisis: The Great War and the Arts and Humanities 1914-1918’ will focus on the interaction between the First World War and other fields, including literature, philosophy, politics, science and culture. It will also pay attention to gender, class and racial inequalities.\n\nThe focus of this proposal is threefold. First, it will explore the extent to which the war influenced cultural practices in Britain. Second, it will examine whether there was a distinctive ‘British’ experience of the war and, third, it will explore how the war affected the rest of Europe. It will examine such things as the popularity of war poetry and how this poetry differed between Britain and other European countries. It will also study the role of women and pacifists in both the Allied and Central Powers, while looking at the role of new technologies in European and especially British warfare.\n\nDr Jason Varitek, Director of the Institute of Historical Research said: ‘I am delighted that both the Faculty of History and the Institute of Historical Research have been successful in this prestigious call. They demonstrate the breadth of our expertise and the strength of our research. The Institute will now be seen as a centre for Holocaust research and, in the case of the first proposal, as a world centre for Holocaust memorials. The second proposal is particularly timely and the importance of this period for contemporary Europe should be obvious to everyone.’\n\nFurther details of both these projects and the other successful proposals are available on the AHRC website at: http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/media/newsevents/announcements/innovative_and_innovative_schemes/ace_prizes_awards_2011_2012/\n\nTwitter: @IHRKCL<|endoftext|>Online retail giant Amazon is creating new jobs for thousands of people. The company is looking for people to work in new warehouses in Texas and Tennessee, the company said Wednesday.\n\nThe Dallas Business Journal reports that more than 1,000 jobs will be added in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nAmazon is planning to open a new “sortation center” in Haslet, which will create 1,000 new jobs. The company also announced plans to open a new 855,000-square-foot “sortation center” in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch area, which will create about 900 jobs. The company said both the Haslet and Carrollton-Farmers Branch facilities will begin operations in late 2019.\n\nThe Haslet facility will be located at 5550 Haslet Blvd. in the Haslet ISD. The Carrollton-Farmers Branch facility will be located in the International Trade and Logistics Center.\n\nAmazon is also adding more than 1,000 jobs in Murfreesboro, Tenn. The company announced plans to open a new 855,000-square-foot “sortation center” in the Rutherford County community, which will create more than 1,000 full-time jobs.\n\nThe new Murfreesboro facility will be located at the Rutherford County Industrial Park. The facility is expected to begin operations in late 2019.\n\n“With Amazon adding three new facilities in North Texas, including the company’s first sortation center in the region, we have seen the local demand for employment and skilled labor increase substantially over the past year,” Joe Deschamps, executive vice president of economic development with the North Texas Council of Governments, told the Dallas Business Journal. “We have partnered with Amazon on their expansion projects and our region has seen the positive impacts that Amazon has brought to our local economy and workforce.”\n\nFollow @KTAR923<|endoftext|>How do you buy in case of personal items?\n\nWhere can I buy?!\n\nI know that I can have it shipped to US for the next available.

If he is, he'll end up shooting himself in the foot, because a certain Jimmy Bondoc is a man who never loses. And because he's been around for over 30 years, Jimmy Bondoc knows a thing or two about writing songs. Just check out his latest offering, \"It's Time To Say Goodnight,\" which he wrote in a matter of minutes and it was his wife, the singer Wency Cornejo, who made him listen to the song.\n\n\"Lagi nasa States ako and she would record me on her iPhone. When I heard this song, I told myself, 'Wow! Galing 'to!' After that, I did my version in the studio and I guess my fans loved it because nasa Spotify ito ngayon,\" Jimmy shares.\n\nIn a market where love songs are booming, Jimmy's \"It's Time To Say Goodnight\" stands out, not only because it's sung by Jimmy himself, but also because it's about a relationship that is about to come to an end, for good. \"Ikaw ang mahal ko/ pero it's time to say goodnight/ Hindi na masisira ang nakaraan natin/ I wanna thank you for being there,\" Jimmy sings in the chorus.\n\nJimmy is part of the legendary \"Juan For All, All For Juan\" group, the group that scored many hits during the '80s, from the Philippine pop classic \"Kung Sakali\" to the iconic \"That's Entertainment,\" which launched a million and one dance moves. \"This is my group, the first OPM group, and we're still here. Our members are in the States now, but every year we get together and perform in the Philippines,\" Jimmy shares.\n\nHe has his own fan club in the States. \"When I perform here, it's sold out every time,\" he says.\n\nJimmy does get star struck, especially when he meets his old idols, like the late, great Dolphy. \"Baka"

If you are a regular beach goer, you probably have a beach bag full of bottles of lotion. However, did you know that sunscreen is not the only way to protect your skin?\n\nThere are many sunscreens available on the market today. When you shop for a sunscreen, you want one that provides good protection and that is gentle to the skin. Many people choose a spray-on sunscreen for convenience. It is possible that the spray-on sunscreen is not as effective as a lotion or cream. If you are concerned about your skin, consider this spray sunscreen.\n\nBuy Coppertone Continuous Spray Sunscreen SPF 30 here!\n\nThe Coppertone Continuous Spray Sunscreen is an SPF 30 sunscreen that is applied to the skin in a mist. The sunscreen will not clog pores, and it provides even coverage.\n\nThis sunscreen is a spray-on sunscreen, so you will need to be careful when you are applying it to the skin. You should not spray it on clothing, and you should avoid spraying it near your eyes.\n\nIt does take some practice to get the hang of applying the sunscreen with the spray. In general, you will not use as much of the sunscreen if you are spraying it onto your body as opposed to putting it on your skin with your hands.\n\nThis sunscreen can be applied to all parts of the body. Many users choose to use it on their faces because it is lighter than lotion. However, it can be used on the entire body, and it is effective at protecting against sunburn and long term damage from the sun.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe spray-on sunscreen will provide an even application of the sunscreen.\n\nThe sunscreen does not have an oily or greasy feeling.\n\nThe sunscreen is gentle enough for the face.\n\nIt is water resistant, but it is not waterproof.\n\nThe sunscreen will not clog pores.\n\nThis sunscreen is suitable for all skin types.\n\nThis sunscreen is hypoallergenic.\n\nPros\n\nThe sunscreen is easy to apply with the spray, so it can be used on the entire body.\n\nThis sunscreen is lightweight.\n\nIt is convenient to use.\n\nCons\n\nThe spray-on sunscreen does not have a scent.\n\nThe sunscreen can be messy to apply.\n\nThe sunscreen is expensive.\n\nThe spray-on sunscreen does not provide the same level of protection as a lotion.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Coppertone Continuous Spray Sunscreen is a good sunscreen, but it is not the same as a lotion. While the sunscreen is a convenient and easy way to apply sunscreen to the skin, it is not as effective as lotion. You may need to reapply the sunscreen more often than you would need to reapply lotion. It is a good sunscreen, but it is not the best sunscreen.\n\nClick here to purchase the Coppertone Continuous Spray Sunscreen!<|endoftext|>Think only this:\n\nif my breath,\n\nmy thought, my word\n\nthe current I am\n\ncould touch the world\n\nfor just an instant\n\nit would ripple outward\n\nand someone else\n\nwould catch the pattern\n\nand rise and smile\n\nand carry on\n\nand for an instant,\n\nsomeone else would feel\n\nbetter.\n\nLove,\n\n-Jamey\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nMore\n\nReddit\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nPocket\n\nLike this: Like Loading...<|endoftext|>To mark its 45th anniversary, Jaguar is reintroducing the D-Type, the “grail” of all racing cars, into the Jaguar Heritage Portfolio.

This little gadget works better than I expected. We have used it as a colander and strainer (we actually bought it to help my wife with her rheumatoid arthritis and its helping) and its done a great job. I can't really see it being an issue unless you have a bad habit of dumping heavy objects on your hands. The holes are small enough that it does a good job of straining and letting the water through. We have also used it as a small colander for veggies and have used it in the shower to rinse and wash our hands. One of the main reasons we got this was to help with her arthritis and joint pain from getting food off of her hands. We're big fans of \"drying\" dishes by rinsing in the dishwasher with a cup of water and 1/4 of vinegar and this is perfect for that and getting a lot of the left over water off of our hands.\n\n\n\nI know some reviews say its too big for some, but honestly I think its the perfect size for what we need.\n\n\n\nTo"

(Getty Images)\n\nApproximately 85 percent of adults read newspapers at least once a week, according to a Pew Research Center survey. A letter to the editor is one of the easiest ways to get your views out to a wide audience, but writing a good letter can be a challenge.\n\nKeep in mind that editors receive numerous letters each day, and a poorly written one can wind up in the trash. The best way to get your letter published is to get it right the first time.\n\nDecide on the newspaper and specific editor to whom you will submit your letter.\n\nWhen you are ready to write your letter, take time to think about your approach. Most letters are written to express opinions, respond to other published letters, or request an action by a government official or business. A typical newspaper runs fewer than five letters per day, according to a survey of about 150 daily newspapers conducted by the Newspaper Association of America.\n\nMake sure your letter includes enough relevant information.\n\nUse standard grammar and spelling.\n\nWrite a short, interesting letter, and avoid writing in a patronizing tone.\n\nAvoid anger.\n\nAddress a point with concrete examples rather than speculation.\n\nKeep the letter within a certain word limit, which varies by newspaper. (Most major newspapers limit letters to 250 words or less.)\n\nInclude your contact information, including your address and phone number. (If you include your e-mail address, make sure you use a pseudonym and a private account.)\n\nIf you are replying to a previous letter, be sure to include the date and the name of the writer you are replying to.\n\nIf you are requesting a particular action, be sure to include what you are asking for.\n\nFor example, instead of writing, “I think the mayor should resign,” write, “I think Mayor Smith should resign.”\n\nSign your letter with your first and last name, rather than “a concerned citizen.”<|endoftext|>A high school librarian in Atlanta will be suspended for one day without pay after challenging a policy banning African-American authors in his classroom.\n\nAtlanta Public Schools' office of human resources has recommended a one-day suspension without pay for Donald T. Sobers, director of library services for the West End High School, according to a district spokesman.\n\nIn September, Sobers told administrators that he felt uncomfortable in his position after he was told he was not allowed to display literature by black authors in his classroom.\n\nIn a letter to school officials, Sobers said the school's policy violated his First Amendment rights and the federal Equal Educational Opportunities Act.\n\n\"I find it highly inappropriate that the school system does not see fit to have black history taught, but does not hesitate to use black children to staff our schools,\" he wrote.\n\nSobers and the school system reached a settlement earlier this month that gives him a one-day suspension without pay. He agreed to drop his appeal to a grievance hearing. The school system also dropped the request to remove Sobers from his position as librarian, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nSobers, who is black, said he was willing to fight the system to make sure that black children get a history education.\n\n\"If that means I'm going to be the sacrificial lamb to help those students, so be it,\" he told ABCNews.com last year.\n\nThe school system's policy against the display of certain books was a common one at Atlanta schools, Sobers said.\n\nIn a memo to Sobers, school officials said, \"African-American authors, at this time, will not be included in our collection development efforts.\"\n\nThey also said the policy was not meant to single out any particular group of authors, but \"is part of a larger collection development strategy to keep our school libraries relevant to the lives of our students.\"\n\nSobers said the policy violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act and his First Amendment rights.\n\n\"It doesn't make any sense,\" he said. \"All it does is present a real big gap in history and the ability to analyze society in terms of what's going on.\"\n\nSobers said he has found that some students have a hard time when they encounter racism in society.\n\n\"The problem is that these children are not getting an accurate historical perspective,\" he said.\n\nSobers said he will use his one day of suspension to spend the day visiting students in the school library and to continue his campaign to have books by black authors included in school libraries.\n\n\"I feel strongly about this,\" he said. \"I'm trying to change it.\"\n\nSince Sobers' story came to light last year, black authors have started writing to school libraries, encouraging them to include black literature in their collections.\n\nOne of them, filmmaker Spike Lee, said he was \"appalled and embarrassed\" when he heard Sobers' story.\n\nLee donated a dozen copies of his film \"School Daze,\" a satire on race relations at a fictional college. The DVDs are displayed in the school library.\n\n\"I felt, we've got to do something,\" Lee told ABCNews.com last year.\n\nLee said he didn't expect his gesture to start a movement.\n\n\"But I hope it does,\" he said.\n\nSchool district spokeswoman Kimberly Willis Green told ABCNews.com in September that the policy to ban black authors from schools will remain in place until the superintendent reviews it.\n\nThe district has not yet released the full recommendation, but the suspension is standard for any supervisor who violates a policy, according to Green.<|endoftext|>1.

"About 75 people attended the open house, at which planners showed maps and photographs of the proposed route and gave a series of short presentations. The maps and the idea for a cycle route to Las Vegas came about through community meetings over the last year, including public meetings in November and May.\n\n\n\nThere are three open houses this month in the wake of a March 5 community advisory committee meeting in which planners identified six possible routes between the two towns.\n\n\n\nThe final route chosen at that meeting was called the southern route, also known as the ranch route. It runs primarily along Route 15, turning east along Box Canyon Road and taking Route 44 west into Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nThe southern route passes through Springtown and Bullard’s Crossing, a subdivision that has only one entrance and exit on the east side of town.\n\n\n\nThe southern route was given a higher priority than the other five routes based on a scoring system that took into account scenic value, viewshed, population and resources affected.\n\n\n\nDuring the March 5 meeting, most of the traffic and resource concerns came from residents of Bullard’s Crossing, a subdivision located about a mile east of the highway. Residents expressed concerns about traffic and safety if the route goes through Bullard’s Crossing, and about passing cyclists causing dust and a lower quality of life.\n\n\n\nThe concerns were addressed during the open house. Project manager Dennis Peacock explained that while a good deal of development had occurred in the past 10 to 15 years, the majority of it was not residential.\n\n\n\nHe said a wide range of ages live in the development, including young families and some older people. He also said people’s vision for Bullard’s Crossing could be different.\n\n\n\nHe said that no more than 25 percent of the vehicles on Box Canyon Road were bicyclists. Peacock also said there are three turn-outs on the road for cyclists to rest.\n\n\n\nHe also pointed out that the path would be nearly 200 feet wide, and that it would be a two-lane paved road.\n\n\n\n“It’s not like we are planning to put a bike path down Main Street in town,” Peacock said.\n\n\n\nResident Tim Johnson said the development and new path would not be mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\n“It would be wonderful to have a development plan for Bullard’s Crossing,” he said. “We want to get along with everyone. It is nice to see what it is going to be.”\n\n\n\nPeacock also said that if the development project did not go through, the path would be moved further north.\n\n\n\nAnother question brought up at the meeting was how cyclists would get to the path in the first place. Peacock said that by the end of 2009, the state was going to convert a portion of Box Canyon Road into an interstate.\n\n\n\n“That is what will get cyclists to Las Vegas,” he said.\n\n\n\nIt was also noted at the meeting that a rider in the Tour de France, after finishing the race, could have been home in Springtown within the same time it took him to finish the race.\n\n\n\nOne of the questions that had not been answered at the community advisory committee meeting was whether the route would be designated as a state or federal highway. Peacock said during the open house that the route would be considered a state highway.\n\n\n\n“The path will be open to any user as long as they have a vehicle that has been registered with the state of Nevada,” Peacock said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the planning maps, the path would pass by the Spring Valley and Bullard’s Crossing reservoirs, two popular fishing and boating spots for Springtown and Bullard’s Crossing residents.\n\n\n\nPeacock said there were provisions for “get out of the way” ramps for fishermen. The route would also pass over the top of them, taking the route over land, and not through the reservoir.\n\n\n\nThere was also a question about cyclists using the path at night. Peacock said that the project had received funding to put LED lighting down the entire route.\n\n\n\n“You will be able to ride that at night,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe route has been designed to accommodate a commuter, recreational, equestrian and bicycle tourism user.\n\n\n\nThe next community meeting is planned for April 1 in Las Vegas.<|endoftext|>Event Details\n\nHands on Labs\n\nSponsored by Microsoft\n\n\n\nLearn what makes Azure a leading platform for enterprise IT.

Za Plenkovića se takvi spisi kod poslanika tumače kao podrška takozvanom antifašističkom pokretu i neprihvatanje srpske istorije.\n\n„Što se tiče odbijanja prava srpskom narodu, posebno stvaranje Jugoslavije, to je istorijsko krivovjerje, i danas žive ljudi koji su bili pobijeni u ratovima, i koji su imali krivična dela, i nije im to uspjelo. Tako da, o tome ne treba raspravljati, nema ni jedne velike države koja se ne temelji na istorijskoj istini“, rekao je Plenković i nastavio.\n\n„Nama je stalo do toga da jednog dana uzmu mjesto koje im zaslužuju, i pogotovo u Evropi, i imaju možda mali udes, i nema ih mnogo, ali je veliki koncept koji imamo u Evropi.“\n\nTo govori ne samo o njegovom odnosu prema istoriji, nego i prema osnovnom pravilu u svakoj zemlji, a to je da predsednik države podnosi ostavku, pa makar i bez krivice, ili možda pak i kriv.\n\nPosebno je zanimljivo to što se ta istorija u Hrvatskoj već dugo vremena nastoji zaboraviti, a posebno sve ono što se u Evropi ne ističe. Tako je hrvatski narod, iako ga"
"Russia remains the most dangerous place in the world for journalists, according to the latest edition of the international watchdog's Press Freedom Index.\n\nThe report from Reporters Without Borders (RSF) singled out the killing of investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya, whose \"barbaric murder\" last year, carried out by \"agents of the state\", was symbolic of the decline of freedom of expression in Russia.\n\n\"It was under Vladimir Putin that this decline became clear,\" RSF said, referring to the president's eight years in office.\n\n\"Once Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested in 2003 and the media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky was forced to flee the country, the government was no longer constrained in its quest for self-preservation,\" RSF said.\n\nKhodorkovsky's arrest, along with the 2004 jailing of former nuclear power chief Yevgeny Adamov, marked \"the beginning of a media crackdown aimed at creating a climate of fear that has lasted to this day.\"\n\nRSF pointed to an unprecedented number of journalists jailed in Russia in 2006. At least 10 were jailed in the wake of the November 2005 massacre of schoolchildren in the town of Beslan, including three for covering the aftermath of the hostage-taking.\n\nBut the watchdog said the root of the problem lies in the \"paradox\" that Russia has one of the world's freest media environments but that independent journalists are often threatened.\n\nIt warned that Russia's near-total control of the media, either directly or through a strong grip on business, gives \"permission\" to many people to attack journalists.\n\n\"A state of anxiety\"\n\nWhile the 2005 conviction of former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the trial of pro-democracy activists in the so-called \"Bolotnaya Square case\" in early 2012 showed that criticism of the government can still be punishable, RSF said Russia is \"in the grip of a veritable witch-hunt against media workers and their sources.\"\n\n\"We're living in an era of secrecy, both governmental and corporate, which has encouraged people to spy on each other, including journalists,\" the report said.\n\nThe watchdog also pointed to the restrictive new law on NGOs adopted by Russia last year as a sign that \"self-censorship is becoming a way of life\" for media professionals in the country.\n\n\"Journalists are scared, and have good reason to be. Too many of them are exposed to threats, some of which have proved to be fatal. A climate of fear reigns,\" RSF said.\n\nThe report said the 2008 launch of a government body to oversee and censor the media, the Federal Service for the Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media, was \"proof of the excessive zeal of the authorities in their efforts to exercise control.\"\n\nThe situation was worse for journalists outside the capital, RSF said.\n\n\"They have been the target of frequent beatings and kidnapping. In Chechnya, where the Chechen regime uses abductions and torture to force journalists to join the local media, the capital Grozny is now the most dangerous place in the country for media workers.\"\n\nThe latest edition of the report, now in its 12th year, is based on an assessment of press freedom in 199 countries, graded into one of five categories: good, satisfactory, problematic, bad and very bad.\n\nThe top three positions in the index were unchanged from last year.\n\nFinland, Norway and Netherlands were again in first, second and third place.\n\nThe bottom three positions went to Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea.<|endoftext|>Trump’s early morning tweet: “In many places the same person in California votes many times.”\n\nOne of the central claims of President Trump’s “Spygate” tweetstorm on Sunday was that “millions” of people are voting “illegally” in California.\n\nNot only is there no evidence of this, the president offered no explanation of why he believes this is the case. He did not mention any sources of his information.\n\nIn many places the same person votes many times.\n\nVoter fraud is a myth — but a powerful one.\n\nIn reality, voter fraud is so rare that it is nearly impossible to find a documented case in the United States. This hasn’t stopped politicians, conservative pundits and talk show hosts from using the specter of widespread voter fraud to cast doubt on the validity of elections and push voter ID laws that make it harder for millions of people to vote.\n\nTrump has previously made a claim about millions of people voting illegally in California, but he has not offered evidence to back up the claim.\n\nWe reached out to the White House for support for Trump’s tweets, but they did not respond.\n\nBut there’s another, more complicated question here: Just because no one has found a case of voter fraud in the way Trump described, does that mean no such case exists?\n\nThe answer to that question is far less simple.\n\nWhy Trump’s claim is difficult to prove\n\nThere is a lot of public data about the American voting system. It is available from state election officials and collected and shared by the federal government. And for the most part, that data is very granular.\n\nBut, as explained by election law expert Rick Hasen, the data doesn’t show how people vote. Instead, it shows things like when and where they voted, who they voted for and which voting machine they used.\n\nThis means we don’t have a clear picture of how people vote, let alone how they voted in multiple states.\n\nAs Hasen explained to us, this is not a failure of the data.\n\n“Most of this data is publicly available and most of it is voter registration data,” he said. “And when we talk about illegal voting, we are not talking about impersonation of a voter at a polling place. That’s what most people think of when they think of voter fraud. But the real problem is in-person voter fraud is very rare.”\n\nWhen people talk about voter fraud, they often mean voting under the name of a dead person or voting multiple times under different names, something that is also very difficult to pull off. But when a state detects an allegation of a voter fraud problem, it usually involves people who have moved to a new jurisdiction, have died or were felons who shouldn’t have voted.\n\n“This is the more common type of voter fraud, but there is no good way to check for it in the voter registration system,” Hasen said.\n\nTrump’s voter fraud claim doesn’t make sense\n\nThe president’s claim that people are voting illegally in California also makes little sense.\n\nThe state has some of the strictest voting laws in the country. In addition to requiring voter ID, it conducts routine audits and has one of the most expansive and thorough monitoring systems of any state in the country.\n\nMoreover, California is a reliably Democratic state that regularly votes for Democratic presidential candidates. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the state by more than 3.4 million votes, the widest margin of any state.\n\nCalifornia also holds its presidential primary in June, making it almost impossible to vote in the state’s primary and vote again in the general election in November.\n\nThat would be very difficult to pull off in California, but that’s only one of the many issues with Trump’s claim.\n\nFinally, the president’s accusation doesn’t make sense because it suggests that millions of people would have to be voting illegally in the state for his claim to be true.\n\nAccording to the most recent data from the state, there were 19.4 million registered voters in California.\n\nIf each of those people voted just once, and we don’t know who they voted for or what machine they used, that means that millions of people would have to vote illegally in California for Trump’s claim to be true.\n\nWe don’t know how many people voted in the 2016 election in California, let alone how many people voted multiple times.\n\nWhy this is important\n\nThis is not to say that there aren’t issues with the American voting system.\n\nThere are serious issues with voter disenfranchisement, specifically with minority voters and people with felony convictions.\n\nTo address this problem, activists and voters have called for reforms that would make it easier for more people to vote, including automatic voter registration.\n\nBut that’s not what Trump is talking about.\n\nHe is peddling a myth to support his claim that millions of people illegally voted in the 2016 election. And he is continuing to do so long after he secured the presidency.<|endoftext|>Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Farc is the only active rebel group in Colombia\n\nColombia's Farc rebels have admitted that one of their fighters shot dead a 10-year-old boy and wounded his father in a remote village in 2002.\n\nA statement from the left-wing rebels said the killer had been killed and was offering his apologies to the victims.\n\nThey also apologised for the murder of three civilian contractors in a separate incident.\n\nThe rebels have agreed to make reparations for some of their crimes as part of ongoing peace talks with the government.\n\nMore than 220,000 people have been killed since the Farc and smaller rebel groups began their insurgency in 1964.\n\n'Unjust aggression'\n\nThe Farc statement did not say which unit was responsible for the 2002 murder of the 10-"
"How to Give Your Ball Python a Bath\n\nBy Jeff Ronne\n\nWhether your snake has been in hibernation for a while, or you've had him for a long time and he's gotten a little rank, you'll want to give your snake a bath. Bathing your snake is relatively easy, but it is a delicate process that you should take your time with.\n\nStep 1\n\nMix warm water with a bit of vanilla in it. Put the water in a small bucket and test it on the inside of your elbow to make sure it's not too hot. Put the snake in the bucket.\n\nStep 2\n\nGently run a washcloth through your snake's body. Go through every crevice you can. After you've done that, take a very soft toothbrush (soft, not hard) and scrub his scales. Scrub hard, but be gentle.\n\nStep 3\n\nPut your snake back in the water. If you have a separate feeding tub, fill it with water and place it next to the water. You can then put your snake in there to eat after he is all done.\n\nStep 4\n\nLeave the snake in the bath until he stops moving around.\n\nStep 5\n\nLet the snake dry by putting him back in the enclosure he came from or in a box for a while. Make sure the enclosure he is placed in has enough ventilation.<|endoftext|>Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship died today at the age of 74.

The box is not so heavy and it feels nice to hold.The perfume bottle is shiny. On top, there is an Armani logo. On the bottom, you can find the name of the perfume.\n\nI like the appearance of this new perfume. It looks fresh and shiny.\n\nThis Armani Eau de Parfum is unisex, but it is an elegant perfume for women.\n\nThe perfume bottle is transparent, but the liquid is coloured light pink. I have read that the colour of the perfume was chosen so it could match the colour of the box, which is also pink.\n\nThe spray is strong, so one spray is enough. When you spray the perfume, you can feel a very nice, light scent, which is very similar to the original Armani Code, but it’s not as strong as the original Armani Code Eau de Parfum.\n\nThe perfume lasts about 6 hours. The first hour, you can feel the perfume the most. The second hour, you can smell it a little bit. The third hour, you can smell it less.\n\nAs I said before, this new perfume is a very elegant, very light and nice perfume, but not very long lasting. If you want a longer lasting perfume, you should check out the other Eau de Parfums of Armani.\n\nPrice and availibility\n\nThe perfume is available at the official Armani Online Store and costs £40 (approx. 44 euros).<|endoftext|>Your gift makes a real difference in the lives of your friends, family and colleagues!\n\n\n\nGifts to a designated person in your will can be one of the best and most cost-effective ways of supporting CASA.\n\n\n\nGifts to a designated person in your will, as opposed to donating cash or property while you’re still alive, have the following advantages:\n\nThe value of the gift is tax-free.\n\nThe value of the gift is tax-free.

As with any relationship, the communication and commitment must be there. It is a good idea to have a list of the things you love about your partner, your partner’s name tattooed on your body, and a sense of humor. You must be willing to put aside any differences to remain committed to the relationship. If you are not already in a long-distance relationship, then you need to decide if you are willing to take the risk. The most important part of a successful long-distance relationship is communication. Some things that may be helpful are writing a letter, chatting on the phone or setting up a computer webcam to be able to see each other. Try not to have a long-distance relationship for the first time when you are really in love because it is easy to be disappointed. After a few months of long distance, if you still love each other then you may want to start planning for your future together. Many people in long-distance relationships will have a friend or relative who can help facilitate them meeting each other. It is important to try and make this first meeting as special as possible to help build the foundation for a long-distance relationship.\n\nLong-distance relationships are no different than any other relationship. If you have a lot of passion and love for one another, then you will be able to work through all of the issues to make your long-distance relationship successful. It is important to try and find out what your partner’s interests are to help facilitate the conversation. It is also helpful to communicate with them about things that are bothering you or concerns you have about the relationship. It is important that you both know each other’s feelings and be able to communicate them in a productive way. Remember that each relationship is different and you must work to understand your partner in order to have a successful long-distance relationship.\n\nSearch\n\nUniversal Sports Articles<|endoftext|>Denim & Co. \"How Slimming!\" 2-Pack Petite Stretch Jeans is rated 4.0 out of 5 by 34 .\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by ladv from great pants perfect fit. love the length. great to wear with boots and sweaters\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Golfern from Wonderful pants!

In his book, \"Benevolent Giants: America's Biggest Charities and Why They Do It,\" Stuart Rosenblatt, CEO of AspenPointe, writes that by examining the financial ratios of big non-profits, small non-profits can learn a great deal.\n\n\"In researching this book, I found that the really big ones—the giants—have an enormous competitive advantage because they understand and execute a certain set of rules that the rest of us need to pay attention to,\" he writes.\n\nWhile the mega-charities each have their own history and distinctive missions, they share commonalities and major financial ratios. Rosenblatt's research finds that a large non-profit can raise one-and-a-half times as much as a small non-profit for every $1 they spend.\n\n\"Smaller non-profits can use the lessons in this book to benchmark and improve their financial ratios and thus raise more money than they can now,\" he writes.\n\nA key to this book is to understand that while small non-profits may be small, there are principles that they can implement that apply across the board, he explains.\n\n\"The basics of running a non-profit apply to both small and big ones,\" he writes.\n\nAccording to Rosenblatt, the secret sauce of these \"benevolent giants\" is the fact that they're profitable.\n\n\"I've found that being profitable is a central, unifying theme of these organizations, and the one they are most consistently successful at implementing. The CEOs of these giant non-profits all seem to know that to build a big charity, you have to be profitable,\" he writes.\n\nThis success is due to how the big non-profits' management and leadership behave, writes Rosenblatt.\n\n\"One of the great things about the really big charities is that their financial results are directly linked to the quality of management and leadership,\" he writes.\n\nTo read an excerpt from Rosenblatt's book, go to: http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2014/03/14/in-book-benevolent-giants-americas-biggest-charities-explain-their-secret-sauce/<|endoftext|>Last updated at 08:01 04 October 2006\n\nA former High Court judge who carried out a number of research studies into the reliability of forensic evidence has said some are \"next to useless\".\n\nSir Robin Kay, now a judge in the Court of Appeal, also warned that many people are wrongfully convicted as a result of the fallibility of such evidence.\n\nSir Robin, who took part in a study into the reliability of fingerprint evidence, also warned that there is \"little or no correlation between scientific skill and reliability\".\n\nSir Robin's comments were made in a speech on the reliability of forensic science given at the inaugural meeting of the UK Commission on Forensic Science in London on Monday.\n\nThe commission is made up of five distinguished members and will examine issues relating to forensic science, including the regulation of expert witnesses and identification evidence.\n\nThe Home Office said it had been set up in response to the case of Barry George, the man wrongly convicted of the murder of TV presenter Jill Dando.\n\nThe commission will also study the use of DNA and firearm evidence.\n\nIn his speech, Sir Robin said that the reliability of fingerprint evidence was a particular concern because the development of that field had outstripped \"our understanding of the science behind it\".\n\n\"It has now reached a point where it is hard to find any fingerprints expert who would say he was 100 per cent sure that he could pick up and analyse a fingerprint and be certain of its reliability,\" Sir Robin said.\n\n\"I am afraid to say that much of the evidence I have seen on forensic science is next to useless.\"\n\nThe judge also raised concerns about the \"skills and reliability\" of experts in fields such as DNA, firearms and fibre-typing.\n\nSir Robin said the former director of public prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, had given him the impression that no more than 10 per cent of fingerprints evidence was \"good and sound\".\n\n\"In the light of this information, I would think it imperative to reconsider the use of fingerprints in our courts,\" Sir Robin said.\n\n\"The position in relation to other types of forensic science is no better.\"\n\nSir Robin, who was speaking after two years of research into the reliability of forensic science, said: \"In the light of the information I have reviewed over the past two years, I am concerned about the way in which forensic science is being conducted in this country and I am concerned about the high number of wrongful convictions which may be a consequence of the fallibility of such science.\"\n\nIn his speech Sir Robin said there was a \"dearth of scientific and statistical information\" about the reliability of forensic science.\n\n\"No one could be accused of doing nothing, but even with the plethora of reports and research studies there is little or no correlation between scientific skill and reliability,\" he said.\n\n\"It would be very wrong of us to think that because someone has obtained a PhD and been appointed to a university department as a forensic scientist that this necessarily means they will be reliable.\n\n\"As I have said, some of the material which has been presented to me, and which I would not think should be called scientific evidence, has been submitted as expert testimony to the courts.\"\n\nThe judge said he believed that some prosecutors were using scientific evidence without realising it was \"worthless\" because they had no training in how to examine it.\n\n\"I think I am right in saying that it is unusual for prosecutors to have a scientific background.\n\n\"The training of the prosecution and defence barristers is often rudimentary, and this seems to me a serious defect in the system.\n\n\"The public and indeed the courts are entitled to expect that, as in other areas of the law, the prosecution and defence would both be represented by barristers who have a real understanding of the science.\"<|endoftext|>Matta. \"Spendiamo troppo per pagare gli stipendi, ma gli stipendi vanno pagati.

Who would you like to see? Sound off in the comments below!<|endoftext|>In the years after the Second World War, the economy of the Western world, and especially the economies of Europe, started to recover and to show growth. The rebuilding of factories, of roads and bridges, of cities and houses, of harbors and airports had started. The economy of Europe had become an engine of growth for the whole Western world. Countries, companies and people prospered, and a great period of economic growth, rising wages, and improved living standards started in Europe.\n\nThe combination of rebuilding and new investment made Europe a great place to do business. For companies, Europe was a vast market, with its members more or less unified in terms of market regulation, infrastructure, investment policy, and culture. Firms set up factories, invested, and found new markets, and these investments were largely debt-funded.\n\nThe easy availability of cheap money, however, also led to over-indebtedness, as it always does. Since 1945, Europe has had two serious debt crises, in the 1970s and the 2000s. The roots of both crises can be found in over-indebtedness.\n\nToday, the European Union, which in reality is more of a bureaucracy than a country, is facing yet another debt crisis. This crisis was caused by a combination of over-indebtedness and the collapse of a housing bubble.\n\nHousing prices in Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, for example, rose rapidly from the mid-1990s until 2008, creating a bubble. When the bubble burst, banks found themselves holding too many bad debts, and countries found themselves with unsustainable levels of public debt. In the following two years, the economies of these countries contracted by more than 5 percent, and the European economy was pulled into a recession, which, combined with the debt crisis, led to a series of political crises.\n\nIt is unlikely that the European Union will ever again experience the growth of the post-war period. The economies of Europe are simply too different and too regulated for that to happen.\n\nIt is also unlikely that the United States will experience growth on the same scale as in the post-war period. In fact, the U.S. may never experience economic growth again.\n\nFor this reason, the events of this period are of great importance to us, and we can learn from them.\n\nIn the next decade, there will be a major debt crisis in the United States, and the crisis will force the American government to cut spending. It will be a period of cutbacks, consolidation, and defaults.\n\nThis period will be a great time for savers, as interest rates will be lower, and returns on savings accounts, bonds, and equity investments will rise.\n\nWhat caused the debt crises in the 1970s and 2000s?\n\nThe reason for the debt crisis in the 1970s was a combination of falling interest rates, rising inflation, and rising inflation expectations. This caused the value of the debt to increase, since the nominal value of the debt increased faster than the cost of debt. This meant that the government could finance more spending, and that households could buy more cars and houses, and it also meant that companies could invest more.\n\nThe same cause caused the debt crisis of the 2000s, but this time the debt crisis was bigger, since more debt had been created since the 1970s.\n\nThe same cause is present today.\n\nThe United States is experiencing low interest rates, high inflation, and high inflation expectations. This has already caused a housing bubble. It will also create a consumer-debt bubble and a corporate-borrowing bubble.\n\nThese are the three things that caused the crises in the 1970s and 2000s, and they are the three things that cause all debt crises. This is why it is very likely that there will be another debt crisis in the United States, and probably soon.\n\nMost countries have been running big budget deficits for a long time, and this has forced central banks to create money out of thin air, to fund these deficits. This has resulted in a bond bubble, and it has also caused the monetary base of the United States, which consists mostly of bank deposits at the Federal Reserve, to rise from around $1.2 trillion to almost $4 trillion in the last ten years.\n\nThis is the cause of inflation and inflation expectations, and this is the cause of the coming debt crisis.\n\nThe United States will experience a debt crisis within the next few years. Interest rates are set to rise, and bond prices are set to fall.\n\nThis will cause a huge increase in the interest cost of the national debt. It will also cause the value of the dollar to fall, which means that the purchasing power of U.S. dollars will fall, which will reduce consumer spending and cause deflation.\n\nThese are the three things that cause all debt crises, and they are all present today.\n\nSince the debt crisis is approaching, it is wise to take steps to protect yourself.\n\nIn a previous article, I suggested how you could protect yourself, so you should take a look at that article, if you have not done so already.\n\nProtecting yourself\n\nThere are three ways that you can protect yourself.\n\nYou can move your savings into cash, or even gold.\n\nYou can diversify your savings so that your savings are not tied up in any one currency.\n\nYou can start your own business, and you can take your salary in the form of dividends.\n\nYou should do all three of these things, and you should start doing them as soon as you can.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe world is entering a period of debt deflation. This will cause a major economic contraction. The cause of the economic contraction is the over-indebtedness of the United States and other countries.\n\nOver-indebtedness is always a problem for debtors, because it forces them to reduce spending. The most obvious way to reduce spending is to default on debt, but this can also be done by defaulting on promises to the voters, such as pensions and other entitlements.\n\nMany people and countries will suffer as a result of the coming economic contraction, but there is nothing that can be done to avoid it. The economic contraction is not a natural disaster, but rather a man-made problem that was caused by government policies.\n\nGovernment debt and promises are not wealth. They are simply promises to pay, and promises to pay are unsecured liabilities, which means that they are promises to make somebody else’s life worse.\n\nIt is important to understand that a default, or a series of defaults, will be the necessary outcome of the current situation. No government has ever repaid its debt, and there is no reason to believe that the United States will be the first to do so.\n\nSo what should we do to protect ourselves?\n\nWe should diversify our savings, so that our savings are not tied up in any one currency. We should also keep savings in physical cash, and in gold.\n\nWe should take control of our own lives, and start our own businesses, and then we should take a large part of our salary in the form of dividends.\n\nA good dividend stock is a way to hedge against a debt crisis.\n\nThis article was originally published at the Dollar Vigilante here: http://dollarvigilante.com/blog/2015/07/31/coming-debt-crisis-in-the-united-states/<|endoftext|>Tooth Fairies Help Your Child in Ways You Never Imagined!\n\nHere’s a good reason to welcome the Tooth Fairy into your home.

"BASES DE DATOS TABLEROS DE FICHAS.\n\nDescripción general\n\nUn fichero o una base de datos conectada a una entidad que la explota en una base de datos, puede ser una representación desde su punto de vista de una ficha (es decir, que es una ficha para alguna persona) o de una cualquier otra entidad. La ficha es también una representación desde el punto de vista de una base de datos de la entidad de la cual representa una ficha.\n\nComo una entidad se conecta con una base de datos, así una ficha se conecta con una entidad que explota una base de datos.\n\nLas bases de datos tableros de fichas en general, que son un conjunto de filas y columnas que contiene información de alguna entidad.\n\nForma de tableros de fichas\n\nTableros de fichas son la principal forma de crear una entidad de una base de datos, una ficha es la representación desde el punto de vista de una base de datos de una entidad.\n\nAlgunos ejemplos de tableros de fichas son:\n\nGerentes de comercio, empleados, clientes, proveedores, pedidos, tarifas, servicios, precios, etc.\n\nEstructura de una base de datos de tableros de fichas\n\nLa estructura de una base de datos de tableros de fichas es como se muestra en el siguiente diagrama:\n\nLa base de datos de tableros de fichas en la estructura es una base de datos relacional donde las entidades y las relaciones de la base de datos son tableros de fichas y sus columnas y filas, respectivamente.\n\nLas columnas son las características de una ficha o entidad, la fila es la entidad que es el propietario de una columna o característica, o, dicho de otro modo, que es la ficha o entidad que tiene una columna o característica.\n\nAdemás, las columnas también se usan para la creación de las claves primarias, claves de selección, etc.\n\n¿Qué es una columna?\n\nEs una estructura de datos que puede tener un nombre y un tipo de datos, que están relacionados entre sí por una relación, es decir, que las claves primarias, selecciones y claves foráneas están relacionadas a una columna o una clave en especial.\n\nLas columnas no se pueden eliminar de una base de datos de tableros de fichas, ya que las columnas son el representante de una entidad en una base de datos, por lo que cuando eliminamos una entidad desde una base de datos de tableros de fichas, eliminamos también su representación en la base de datos, es decir, las columnas de la entidad.\n\nEn una base de datos de tableros de fichas se puede eliminar una clave foránea, pero no las claves primarias ni las selecciones.\n\nLas columnas también tienen los atributos, que son características o elementos que definen las columnas o fichas de una base de datos de tableros de fichas, entre otros.\n\n¿Qué es una columna de tipo atributo?\n\nSon las columnas que están relacionadas a una clave primaria o a una clave foránea, que no necesariamente necesita una clave de selección para ser referenciada o realizada.\n\nEn una base de datos de tableros de fichas se puede tener la referencia a una columna de tipo atributo, ya sea una clave foránea o primaria.\n\n¿Qué es una columna de tipo restringido?\n\nSon las columnas que están relacionadas a una clave de selección, que tiene restricciones de negocio y de integridad, que están relacionadas a una clave de selección.\n\n¿Qué es una columna de tipo valor?\n\nEs una columna que tiene un tipo de datos, en el cual no es posible una restricción de negocio ni una integridad.\n\nLas columnas de tipo valor no están relacionadas con ninguna clave foránea o primaria, así como tampoco con ninguna clave de selección, por lo que puede realizarse en cualquier fila de una ficha o entidad.\n\nLas columnas de tipo valor son un tipo de datos en sí, que se utilizan en algunas columnas en las cuales no se necesita restricción de negocio ni integridad.\n\nTambién se llaman de tipo atributo, sin embargo, en el modelo relacional se conoce como valor atributo.\n\nCategorías de datos\n\nCada columna o cada ficha en una base de datos de tableros de fichas tiene un tipo de datos y se llama categoría de datos.\n\nEn una base de datos de tableros de fichas se tiene la misma categoría de datos para las columnas o fichas que están relacionadas entre sí, esto es, que se utilizan en las mismas claves foráneas o primarias, o, en una clave de selección.\n\nEsta es una forma de crear claves foráneas, claves primarias o claves de selección, ya que, según la categoría de datos, los datos están relacionados entre sí, con las columnas o claves que ya se tenían antes.\n\nEjemplo de una base de datos de tableros de fichas\n\nVamos a dar un ejemplo de una base de datos de tableros de fichas, de la siguiente manera:\n\nEn una base de datos de tableros de fichas se tiene una entidad que se llama clasificación de artículos, que tiene como columna una clave de selección denominada artículo, que se relaciona con una columna denominada clasificación.\n\nLa clasificación de artículos está relacionada con una entidad que se llama artículo, la cual tiene dos columnas o características:\n\nUn tipo de datos denominado colores que tiene tres valores: azul, blanco, rojo.\n\nUn tipo de datos denominado dónde se encuentra que tiene tres valores: en el país, en el estado, en la ciudad.\n\nLas columnas o claves foráneas que están relacionadas con la clasificación de artículos son las columnas o claves de selección artículo y clasificación, las cuales son tipos de datos de tipo restringido y valor.\n\nTambién se tiene una clave de selección denominada dónde se encuentra que tiene un tipo de datos de tipo restringido.\n\n¿Qué es una clave de selección?\n\nEs una columna que permite realizar una restricción de negocio, esto es, que se pueden realizar en ciertas claves de selección, y no se pueden realizar en otras"

There are so many companies and agencies out there who all claim to offer the same services, it is hard to know what to look for.\n\n\n\nJust like any other business that you are considering, the first thing that you need to do is check online reviews. The best way to do this is to use sites like Google, Yelp, or CitySearch. They are all free to use and it will take just a few minutes of your time.\n\n\n\nIf you see that a company or agency is consistently receiving negative reviews, you may want to reconsider hiring them. There is a good chance that they are taking people's money and not providing any services.\n\n\n\nAnother thing that you want to look for is the length of time that they have been in business. This isn't as important as the online reviews, but it can be a good indication of how legitimate the company is.\n\n\n\nIf you are going to hire a marketing agency, make sure that you get a signed contract before they do anything for you. You will want to be sure that the contract contains everything that you agreed on.\n\n\n\nMake sure that your contract includes things like the length of the agreement, the agreed upon fee, and the specific services that you are paying for. You should also get a clear description of what the agency will do for you.\n\n\n\nOne final piece of advice when hiring a marketing agency is to ask for references. Ask for the references from the last few clients they have worked with. You should also ask for an example of their work.\n\n\n\nWhen looking at their examples, ask yourself the following questions:\n\n\n\n1) Do you like it?\n\n\n\n2) Would you consider it to be marketing?\n\n\n\n3) Does it look professional?\n\n\n\n4) Would you recommend it to a friend?\n\n\n\nIf the answer to these questions is \"no\", you should not hire that agency. The last thing that you want to do is hire an agency who is unable to produce quality work.\n\n\n\nMany companies and agencies today also offer a guarantee of some sort. If you don't get results, then they will refund your money.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to hire a marketing agency, then you should follow the above guidelines. You will be sure that you are working with a good, professional agency.\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|<|endoftext|>The Grand Marnier Orange Curacao Cocktail\n\nWhile I’ve made my rounds tasting the sweeter side of the Cocktail family, I thought it might be good to check out a cocktail with a bit more spice and kick to it. There’s nothing wrong with a sweeter cocktail, but for me it gets a bit redundant. Plus, there’s just as much of a history with some of these spicy cocktails as there are with the sweeter ones. While many of the sweeter cocktails have deep roots in the prohibition era, many of the spicy ones were popular during that time as well, but many of them had their origins before prohibition. The orange curacao cocktail in particular was first documented back in the late 1700’s. Let’s take a look at what the Grand Marnier Orange Curacao Cocktail has to offer.\n\nThe Cocktail\n\nWhat we have here is a very classic cocktail, consisting of only three ingredients. Grand Marnier is the main spirit, but we’ll be adding some orange curacao and some lime juice as well. A lot of citrus, but as we’ll see, it’s a strong cocktail. I’m just making this in a cocktail shaker, but I can see it also being a good shooter, or you could do it as a highball.\n\nThe Taste\n\nThis is a good drink. The orange curacao and the Grand Marnier are well balanced. I can’t say there’s a very dominant flavor to the drink, but that’s a good thing. It does have a very smooth, rich taste to it. The finish is nice and long, and leaves a nice aftertaste as well. Overall it’s a really nice cocktail, and I could definitely see myself enjoying this as an occasional drink.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nThe Grand Marnier Orange Curacao Cocktail is a nice cocktail, especially if you’re looking for a bit more kick to your drinks. It’s also a great cocktail if you’re looking for something a bit lighter. The orange curacao, Grand Marnier, and lime juice all work together nicely, and create a great tasting cocktail. It’s a bit on the strong side, so it’s not for everyone. I would say this is more of an occasional drink for me, but it’s one I’m glad I tried.\n\nCocktails are just a lot of fun to make, and this Grand Marnier Orange Curacao Cocktail is a great example of why. It’s a classic cocktail, it’s a bit spicy, and it’s got a great flavor to it. If you haven’t made cocktails before, this is definitely one you should try, and if you’re looking for a classic cocktail to make, this is a good choice.\n\n(Visited 96 time, 1 visit today)<|endoftext|>In three minutes and forty-four seconds, the short video clips the different stages of a woman’s life. As each new scene replaces the previous one, the viewer learns about the heroine: what is her relationship with her mother, what’s the story behind her scar, what happened to her husband. Then, the video ends with a gunshot that triggers a trauma.\n\nSix years ago, Anna Biller created her second feature film The Love Witch, that tells the story of Elaine, an irresistibly beautiful witch who takes advantage of her charms to seduce men, manipulate them, and drain them of their energies. This is a perfect example of the exploitation of the female body and the overuse of sex, an issue that deeply concerns the director of her next movie The Seven Wonders of a Woman, whose protagonists are also young, beautiful, and sexy women, and whose bodies and sex appeal are the key elements of a professional and financial success that is at the same time a personal failure.\n\nThe “sexual revolution” that Biller wanted to denounce in The Love Witch was partly caused by the Second Wave of Feminism. In her eyes, this revolution turned out to be hypocritical, as the current world of women, which is supposed to be emancipated and free, is often a sad place where women in positions of power and wealth can use their bodies to benefit themselves.\n\nThe Seven Wonders of a Woman centers on the story of Michelle (Jessica Ross), a 24-year-old girl who lives with her older sister Alexis (Andrea Fraser). Her life is in the hands of her sister, who is her manager and agent, her psychiatrist, and her trainer. In fact, Michelle’s appearance and her performances in the films she stars in are all carefully arranged by Alexis.\n\nIn a short sequence of a behind-the-scenes video that gives us a glimpse of Michelle’s work and life, we see how she is practically forced to walk, to stand, and to smile. She is a sex symbol that’s kept on a very tight leash. The way Biller is filming these scenes gives us an idea of how suffocated and imprisoned Michelle must feel, as well as how her life is entirely centered on her own body and beauty.\n\nIf The Love Witch is a feminist movie, The Seven Wonders of a Woman is a character study on a young woman who, because of the people around her, is losing her sense of self. However, it is not a criticism of women. Quite the contrary, Biller’s next movie is a celebration of the feminine.\n\nThe Seven Wonders of a Woman doesn’t only depict the damage that a society obsessed with female sexuality can cause. It also gives us the beautiful and strong portraits of the main character and her entourage. There is a world of women who make a career out of their bodies, and that’s why it is so important for Biller to show them not only as being beautiful and strong, but also as being human and fragile. In the midst of the montage of scenes with their limbs exposed and their faces sometimes filmed from below, there is also a short sequence that shows them running away from the camera. It’s as if they were trying to protect themselves from a prying eye.\n\n“The Seven Wonders of a Woman” will be released on May 31st at Anthology Film Archives in New York, and on July 27th at the Rialto Pictures Cinefamily"

The goal is to provide a continuous trail, open for public use, from Cincinnati to southernmost Columbus. The Corridor is broken into several sub-sections, and is managed by various sub-organizations.\n\nThe Scioto Greenway is an organization formed in 1996 to begin acquiring the corridor land and eventually developing it. Currently, the Greenway consists of of land that is preserved and of corridor that is developed as park land. The Scioto Greenway is also a trail system that currently includes over of trail open for public use.\n\nThe Greenway land is owned by the cities, townships, and county that are a part of the partnership. Some land is still owned by private owners. The partnership acquires the land using a variety of methods, such as land swaps, easements, and purchase of land.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources administers the Ohio portion of the Corridor. The project is part of the Ohio Legacy Trails Network. The National Park Service administers the National Trails System Act, which designates the Corridor as part of the National Trails System. The National Trails System consists of 12 national scenic trails, and eight national historic trails. The Scioto Trail is designated as the first National River Trail. The National Park Service Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance Program (RTCA) provides technical assistance and training to help with the development of the Corridor.\n\nThe Corridor is composed of the Scioto Greenway and its connections.\n\nIn July 2008, a non-profit organization was formed for the Scioto Trail. The organization is called the Scioto Greenway Trail, Inc. The trail is managed by a trail director, who is appointed by the board of directors. The organization is charged with preserving the trail corridor. The board is composed of county commissioners and mayors of cities and towns along the trail.\n\n<|endoftext|>Castillon-en-Couserans\n\nCastillon-en-Couserans is a commune in the Ariège department in the Occitanie region of south-western France.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as \"Castillonnais\" or \"Castillonnaises\".\n\nCastillon-en-Couserans is located in the Pyrénées, in the Couserans valley, some 20 km south-west of Saint-Girons and 20 km north-east of Foix.

He was one of the most influential thinkers in the interwar Poland. He was also a major exponent of Thomism in Poland. Hoene-Wroński is widely regarded as the most prominent and original philosopher of the early 20th century in Poland. He authored several dozen books, mostly in the Polish language, but also some in French, and others in German and English.\n\nHoene-Wroński's work has been cited as an inspiration by many prominent philosophers including Stanisław Leśniewski, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, and Andrzej Mostowski. As a result, the concepts developed by Hoene-Wroński continue to be taught at the Universities of Warsaw, Poznań, and Lublin, as well as the Catholic University of Lublin, and in philosophy departments of the Society of Jesus in Poland. The study of Hoene-Wroński's philosophy and logical work in Poland and abroad is based at the Center for the Study of the Philosophy of Jozef Maria Hoene-Wroński, which is affiliated with the Society of Jesus.\n\nHoene-Wroński was born on 10 April 1884 in Czerniowce, then in the Stanisławów Voivodeship in the south-east of the partitioned Poland, under the rule of the Russian Empire. He was the oldest child of Tomasz Hoene-Wroński (1852-1929), a local magistrate, and his wife, Ludwika née Bartnik (1857-1917). Hoene-Wroński was the fourth child of the family, which also included three sisters, all of whom died during World War II. One of the sisters, Bronisława (1885-1887) died of tuberculosis at the age of 2, while Maria (1888-1890) died of the same illness at the age of 2, and the youngest, Bronisława (1892-1943), was killed during World War II.\n\nAfter graduating from the elementary school in Czerniowce, Hoene-Wroński moved to Lviv in 1900. He graduated from a classical gymnasium in 1903. In 1904, he enrolled in the Philosophy Department of the University of Lviv, where he began his studies under Kazimierz Twardowski, an eminent logician and philosopher. Later, he studied under another notable philosopher, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, the founder of the Lwów–Warsaw School of logic and a proponent of the contemporary logic of Russell and Whitehead. Hoene-Wroński also studied mathematics, obtaining the title of a \"magister of mathematics\" in 1907. In 1910, he earned his doctoral degree in philosophy, and became a professor in the University of Lwów, the most prestigious academic institution in interwar Poland.\n\nIn 1912, Hoene-Wroński married his cousin, Antonina Krystyna (née Brzozowska; 1885–1949), and had five children. His oldest son, Władysław (1913–1997) was the founder of the Lublin-based \"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny\" (State Geological Institute). His second son, Tadeusz (1917–1999) was a doctor of medicine and the founder of the University of Łód"
"You probably already know that you need a password to log in to your computer and the websites that you use. What you may not know is that these passwords are actually really weak. To make your passwords as strong as possible, use these tips and tools.\n\nDo Not Use Real Words\n\nThe first rule of creating passwords is not to use real words. This means that you should not use a sentence or a phrase that is easy for a hacker to guess. One way to make it harder for a hacker to guess your password is to use a few random letters and numbers to form a random word that no one would ever think of.\n\nExamples:\n\nFGHckjd\n\nSw3E17G\n\ncQ12byQj\n\nIf you are trying to remember your passwords, there are many programs that allow you to create a “pass phrase” which is a short series of words that you can easily remember and then be used to create a very strong password.\n\nUse Unique Passwords\n\nIt is very important to use a unique password for every website you use. There are many websites that allow you to have a single sign-on, but this means that hackers have access to all of your information at that one site. Instead, use unique passwords for every site that you use.\n\nDo Not Use Any Personal Information\n\nYou should never use any personal information in your passwords. This means that you should not use your name, your birthday, your kids’ names, or even your pet’s name in your passwords. Personal information is easy for a hacker to figure out and can cause you a lot of grief if your personal information is compromised.\n\nDo Not Rely on a Keypad\n\nYou should not rely on your keypad on your smartphone when creating passwords. There are many programs that can use your keypad to figure out what your password is. To avoid this, use an app that creates passwords. The random password will be stored in a database and you can access it later.\n\nUse Multi-Stage Passwords\n\nSome websites allow you to use a multi-stage password. These passwords have several stages where you have to enter a different password at each stage. An example would be a three-stage password: the first stage is “8,” the second stage is “5,” and the third stage is “1.”\n\nUse Unique Keys\n\nAnother way to make it harder for a hacker to break your password is to use a unique key on your device to create a strong password. Many browsers and operating systems allow you to use a master key to create a password. You can use a master key on your smartphone, tablet, or computer to create a very strong password.\n\nBe Careful When Logging In to Sites\n\nThe final thing you should do is to be careful when logging in to websites. Never click on a link in an email that seems suspicious. Instead, copy and paste the link into your browser. Make sure you know where a link goes before you click on it.<|endoftext|>As Hillary Clinton finally released the transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street firms in the spring of this year, much was made of the millions of dollars she was paid by Goldman Sachs for these appearances. But the speeches themselves are revealing for a number of other reasons. As the excerpts and transcripts of these speeches make clear, the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate is not only closely connected to Wall Street, but has a vision of international affairs that is essentially a continuation of that of the Obama administration.\n\nOne excerpt that stood out was Clinton’s comment that “China’s aggressive [economic] moves in the South China Sea are aimed at intimidating its neighbors.” In the same speech, Clinton went on to describe Chinese ambitions as “more than a twenty-first-century version of the imperialism of previous centuries.” This comment, made in a speech before the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, is a perfect illustration of the hypocrisy of the U.S. position on the issue of China and the South China Sea.\n\nThe U.S. continues to deny that China has any legitimate claim over territory in the South China Sea, where it has clashed with Vietnam and the Philippines, and holds territorial disputes with Malaysia and Brunei. At the same time, the U.S. has steadily increased its military presence throughout the region, holding constant freedom of navigation exercises in which the U.S. engages in provocations to China.\n\nBut if China is acting like the imperialist nations of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the U.S. and its allies are not far behind. The U.S. has taken its position on the South China Sea dispute from the Philippines, a small country that would benefit greatly from being able to deny China access to those waters. The U.S. is also engaged in a trade war with China, which has seen the U.S. begin to investigate Chinese state-owned enterprises that are involved in financing the development of major energy projects in Central and South America. This move, while presented as an effort to curb China’s economic influence in the region, is aimed at forcing the development of oil and gas projects that are more economically viable, which will in turn require that the U.S. provide the financing necessary to make them viable.\n\nClinton also made clear her full support for Israel’s bombardment of Gaza last summer, insisting that it was Israel’s “right” to defend itself. In reality, the right to self-defense is guaranteed under international law, and Israel, like any state, is entitled to defend itself from attack.\n\nClinton also insisted that Hamas is not a terrorist organization, and accused those who say it is of having a “blinkered view.” But the U.S. itself officially labels Hamas a terrorist organization. And despite the fact that Hamas has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, there is no doubt that it is the only major party to the conflict. Israel has worked to destroy all other resistance groups, in the West Bank and Gaza, in order to maintain its domination of the Palestinian population. It also has no qualms about massacring Palestinian civilians if they dare to resist. Clinton’s apparent support for Israel’s destruction of Gaza and the killing of over 2,100 Palestinians last summer is not surprising. But it does demonstrate her willingness to turn a blind eye to mass murder, in the name of what she regards as the “national interest.”\n\nClinton also expressed support for the overthrow of the elected government of Ukraine and its replacement with a government more amenable to the West. The U.S. has maintained support for the Ukrainian regime even as its leaders have used brutal police tactics to suppress anti-government protests.\n\nWhile Clinton did express some opposition to NSA spying in one speech, she insisted that the U.S. must use all the tools at its disposal to spy on potential enemies, as well as its own citizens. In this way, she justified the infamous revelations by Edward Snowden, which exposed the extent of the U.S. spying. At the same time, she opposed the creation of any special court or authority that would be allowed to review U.S. spying activities.\n\nAt one point, she referred to the Obama administration’s attempts to reach an agreement on the nuclear program of Iran as the “toughest negotiating” the U.S. has ever done. She insisted that it was important to reach an agreement, but that Iran would have to be prevented from ever developing a nuclear weapon, in order to preserve Israel’s nuclear monopoly.\n\nClinton’s close connections to Wall Street are only part of the story. She also remains deeply tied to the U.S. military and its efforts to control the planet. These two factors, in turn, make her the perfect representative of the foreign policy establishment and the military-industrial complex. The only real surprise is that so many people can claim to be surprised.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>I have been in my 20's for a few months and I've been quite busy.

She is best known for being the inspiration for the \"New Look\" (after the 1949 collection which she wore to great acclaim).\n\nDe la Falaise was born as Maxime Ray to a wealthy American family. She was the daughter of Florence, a well-known portrait artist, and DeWitt Ray, a mining tycoon. De la Falaise, who grew up in Europe, moved to the United States during World War II, where she met and married American lawyer, writer, and politician Stewart Woodford \"Woody\" Brickell, who was the first man to run for governor of New York state on the Liberal ticket in 1938. The couple adopted two children, Andy and Daphne. De la Falaise met Dior through friends, and she quickly became his muse. In the early 1940s, de la Falaise convinced Dior to hire John Galliano, and later in the 1950s, she suggested that Dior hire Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nDuring her time as Dior's muse, de la Falaise was photographed by both Cecil Beaton and Horst P. Horst. Horst captured her in images for \"Vogue\" and \"Harper's Bazaar\", as well as the cover for Dior's \"New Look\" in 1947. The New Look was an evolution in women's fashion that took place in the 1940s and helped to rebuild Parisian couture after World War II. It was a slimmer, longer silhouette, and one of the dresses, called \"Corolle\", is famous for having influenced the style of Marilyn Monroe. De la Falaise is often credited with inspiring the New Look, and the dress from the collection is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In addition to Dior's fashion house, de la Falaise also influenced the style of Christian Dior S.A. It was said that she made a subtle, but important contribution to the Dior brand.\n\nDe la Falaise died in New York City on January 17, 2002, at the age of 92.\n\n<|endoftext|>Mill Creek, Georgia\n\nMill Creek is a town in Paulding County, Georgia,"

It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter's colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question.\"\n\n[Excerpt: CNN correspondent Jim Acosta says White House intern tried to take away his microphone at news conference]\n\nAcosta later said Sanders's statement was false.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Acosta told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"The president's spokesperson is not telling the truth, though. I did not put my hands on her. In fact, I took my hands off her before she was pulled away. ... You know, Wolf, I think this is just a reflection of the kind of disarray and the kind of mess this White House is in.\n\n\"They can't even keep their story straight,\" Acosta continued. \"I think, you know, Sarah Huckabee Sanders owes me an apology. I think that it's a shame that the White House is saying this. It's a lie. And to call me a 'liar' and a 'dishonest person' in front of the world is outrageous.\"\n\nCNN Correspondent @Acosta: \"They can’t even keep their story straight. They can’t even keep their story straight from one day to the next.\" https://t.co/CwadYtjZ7p pic.twitter.com/2pzG1rDWjg — Fox News (@FoxNews) November 7, 2018\n\nAt a news conference in New York, Acosta said, \"I was just trying to ask a question. . . . We don't need to do this.\"\n\nThe White House accused Acosta of \"placing his hands on a young woman.\" (AP)\n\nCNN's White House correspondent Jim Acosta briefly refused to surrender the microphone when Trump called on him, prompting the president to tell him to get out of the room. Acosta later said he thought the president had made up a question about the Russian investigation to stifle him.\n\nThe woman, later identified as a White House intern, can be seen approaching Acosta and holding out her hand to take his microphone.\n\n\"Pardon me, ma'am,\" Acosta said.\n\n\"Let me go,\" she replied, continuing to hold out her hand for the microphone.\n\n\"Pardon me, ma'am,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am,\" he said as he moved away from her.\n\nShe persisted in reaching for the microphone, and Acosta said, \"Pardon me, ma'am. You need to get out of my face. Please, ma'am. That's enough. That's enough.\"\n\nAfter Acosta's news conference, Sanders responded on Twitter.\n\n\"I've just been denied entrance to the WH. Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit,\" Acosta tweeted. \"Wrong. They just caved to [Trump] and Secret Service.\"\n\nAt the end of his newscast, Acosta was even more critical.\n\n\"In the course of that, they blocked my ability to do my job, which is a constitutionally protected, in this country, and they made sure that you could not see and hear what was happening in the room,\" Acosta said. \"I think that it's important to point out, Wolf, that I was accused by the White House of putting my hands on the young woman. That is a lie.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he and his team had already put together a report about the president's remarks at the news conference before Sanders's statement.\n\n\"That would have been the focus of our reporting,\" he said. \"But of course, you've seen how the White House has handled this today, which is they then sent out Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the podium, to issue a statement that was the exact opposite of what the president said here at this podium. And what the president said here is that he felt that I was somehow being unfair to him in my questioning. And he told me to get out of the room.\"\n\nAcosta also said he was \"surprised\" to be told that he would not be allowed to go into the White House because of the interaction.\n\n\"The fact that they were trying to stop me from doing my job is what I think is wrong,\" he said.\n\nTrump's remarks came during a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May after their talks at the White House.\n\n\"That was a very strange moment, and I think it is crazy,\" Trump said. \"I think it's a very, very serious moment. I don't think it's a question of me calling the press to be nice to them. I think that you have to treat the press with respect. The press goes with me around the country, they're in my office — you mean to tell me you don't talk to them?\"\n\nIn an interview on Fox News, Sanders told host Bret Baier that Acosta's \"pushing and prodding\" made the White House's decision to suspend his press credentials a \"pretty easy\" choice.\n\n\"The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts that way, and refuses to yield to other reporters,\" she said. \"It's within his right to take that action. It's actually not a question of can he do it. It's not an option for him. He must do it. And he did that, which is a shame.\"\n\n\"That behavior is completely unacceptable,\" she added.\n\nAcosta said on CNN, \"It was an absolute untruth, and it was said because they want to make sure that they have control over who gets to ask questions and who doesn't. It's not about anything that I did or didn't do. The White House Press Secretary is getting a little bit spooked about all the negative coverage they're getting, so they're going to come up with ways to try and shut people down. And that's just unacceptable. They can't do that.\"\n\nSanders's statement came after press secretary Stephanie Grisham's initial response to the incident on Twitter.\n\n\"Today the White House fully supported a decision by the secret service to remove a reporter from the @POTUS event for trying to disrupt the event,\" Grisham tweeted.\n\nAcosta is one of the most visible faces in cable news, often playing foil to Trump at contentious press conferences and presidential rallies. Acosta often tries to ask the president questions in the moments before the microphone is handed to other reporters, and has made his points via outbursts and actions in the moment, including shouting and pointing.\n\nAt times, Trump has called on Acosta by name. But more often, Trump refers to Acosta as \"CNN\" — a way to lump the network and its journalists in with the other \"fake news\" media that he claims has spread lies about him and his presidency.\n\nLast year, Acosta clashed with Trump and White House staff during a briefing after the midterm elections.\n\n\"That's enough, that's enough,\" Trump said, interrupting Acosta as he tried to ask a question. \"That's enough. That's enough.\"\n\n\"Mr. President, if there's a rising of racism, if there's a rising of anti-Semitism around the country, do you hold yourself accountable for that?\" Acosta asked.\n\n\"I am not happy with the tone,\" Trump said. \"You shouldn't be either.\"\n\nLater in the news conference, Acosta was again refused a question when he tried to interject.\n\n\"Excuse me, ma'am,\" Acosta said as a White House staffer tried to pull him away from the microphone. \"If he doesn't get a question, then CNN doesn't get a question.\"\n\nTrump responded by waving off Acosta and turning to another reporter.\n\n\"I'm not going to give you a question,\" Trump said. \"You are fake news.\"\n\nThe CNN reporter, who has served as the network's chief White House correspondent since 2017, has drawn frequent criticism from Trump and his allies. Last week, his Twitter account was briefly suspended after he shared a video of Trump and a White House aide. The aide had attempted to take the microphone from him during the news conference, prompting a brief altercation.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Trump called Acosta a \"liar\" and said that \"CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them.\"\n\n\"Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN,\" Trump said. \"Remember when he totally fabricated what I said about the @AP and other news outlets. Such a dishonest person. Sadly, they will never report the truth"
"Usual Magistrate & ORT Reporter, Osisioma, Magistrate Court of Asa Local Government Area, Kogi State, Mr. Uthman El-Farouq, has denied taking bribe from a deceased old woman, Mrs. Aderonke Alaka.\n\nEl-Farouq, who made the denial during interrogation at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Lokoja, on Thursday, said he had never known the deceased before her death.\n\nAccording to him, he did not receive a petition from the deceased and that the signature in the petition, which is part of his evidence at the police station, was not his signature.\n\nEl-Farouq said: “I do not know Aderonke Alaka. The signature in the petition is not mine. I have never known her before her death. It was God that was my strength.”\n\nHe denied the allegation of the state’s Minister of Works and Infrastructure, Chief Sunday Abalo, that he had extorted money from the late Mrs. Alaka before she died.\n\nHe said: “It is a lie. The person they are talking about has never been to my court. I have never taken a kobo from her. The claim by the Minister is not true.”\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the minister had accused the Usual Magistrate of extorting N100,000 from the late Mrs. Alaka before she died.\n\nThe minister, who had later apologised for the accusation, had said that the late Mrs. Alaka had died from grief and embarrassment after the magistrate demanded the bribe from her.\n\nAbalo had said: “I know Mrs. Alaka was with her son at Asa’s Medical Centre when they sent her to our Ministry of Health.\n\n“The family was shocked to find out that a demand of N100,000 was made to them for surgery for their mother.\n\n“She refused to pay the amount because of her pride and the family was not able to find that amount.\n\n“The family was trying to raise money to take the woman for treatment. The woman died from the shock of the demand of money from the Usual Court,” he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the minister had on January 18 accused the magistrate of asking for N500,000 from Mrs. Alaka before she could see her son, Adekunle Alaka, who was in detention for allegedly breaching the state’s environmental law.\n\nMrs. Alaka had died of grief after her son was detained for several days for the alleged offence.\n\nThe minister, who did not explain why Mrs. Alaka had not been taken to the Usual Magistrate, said the matter would be further investigated by the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, who visited the state recently.\n\nAbalo said the late Mrs. Alaka was at the Medical Centre in Asa, Kogi, and that they were treating her until the intervention of the magistrate.\n\nAbalo also explained that he took the decision to release Alaka’s dead body after receiving a letter from the Usual Magistrate demanding that his corpse be released to him.\n\n“I personally followed up the matter after receiving the letter from Usual Magistrate. I asked our officers at Asa to locate the late Alaka’s corpse.\n\n“When they found the corpse, they released it to the Usual Magistrate. I have no problem with that.”\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the state’s police command had also received a petition from Alaka’s family accusing El-Farouq of demanding money from them before they could take the corpse of their mother.\n\nThe late Mrs. Alaka had been buried in the village without her children having seen her body.\n\nThe petition had accused El-Farouq of having the corpse of their mother in his house and that he was demanding N500,000 from the family to release the corpse for burial.\n\nThe body of Mrs. Alaka was later exhumed from El-Farouq’s house.\n\nThe late Mrs. Alaka’s husband, Sunday Alaka, said he had sent N30,000 to El-Farouq through a courier to have his wife’s body released for burial.\n\nHe said the Usual Magistrate had claimed that his wife had written a letter to him, seeking treatment for an ailment, which he could not read.\n\nAlaka said: “I want my wife’s body released for burial so that I can have a permanent resting place for her.\n\n“The body was supposed to be released after a short time but it was not until the intervention of the ministry of Works and Infrastructure that the corpse was released.”\n\nEl-Farouq had also been accused of extorting money from people before they can be granted bail by the court.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Usual Magistrate, in a bid to prevent his arrest by the police, had gone into hiding.\n\nThe state’s police command had at a news conference declared El-Farouq wanted, following a petition sent to them by the Usual Magistrate himself.\n\nThe command had said that the Usual Magistrate had confessed that he took bribe from the late Mrs. Aderonke Alaka before her death.\n\nThe command’s spokesperson, Asinim Butswat, had said: “We received a petition from the Usual Magistrate.\n\n“He was complaining of a petition from a person. He said he has been collecting money from people before they can be granted bail by the court.”\n\nButswat had also told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the state’s Commissioner of Police, Mr. Amba Asad, had ordered an investigation into the matter.\n\nHe said: “The command got a petition from Usual Magistrate Uthman El-Farouq.\n\n“The Magistrate has confessed that he collected money from people who needed to be granted bail by the court.\n\n“The Commissioner of Police has ordered that an investigation be carried out on the matter.”\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Usual Magistrate, in a petition sent to the state’s Police Commissioner, had accused some policemen of demanding bribe from him before he can be granted bail.\n\nEl-Farouq said: “A police officer and his colleague called me on a particular day and said they wanted to collect money for themselves.\n\n“The police officer came with another police officer and they said they want money for themselves.”\n\nEl-Farouq had alleged that the two police officers had refused to release him on bail unless he paid them.\n\nHe said: “The police officers asked me to pay them N50,000 each to help me be granted bail.\n\n“I said to them that I do not have the money and they said I should tell the court that I do not have money to grant me bail.”\n\nThe Usual Magistrate had also asked for protection from the police for him not to be lynched by angry citizens over the death of Mrs. Alaka.<|endoftext|>Załóż konto i odbierz 50 PLN za darmo Przejdź do bet365\n\nTym razem za tydzień 1 kwietnia, przypadający na godz. 14:45, rozegrany zostanie na Estadio de Valencia mecz drugiej fazy grupowej.

It codified bigotry against gay Americans, and was an egregious and ridiculous expression of the government’s will to regulate and even punish the lives of gays, lesbians, and their families. Ad Policy\n\nBut it is gone now.\n\nThe Defense of Marriage Act was supposed to stop courts from applying the Constitution’s guarantees of equality to gay and lesbian couples. It was supposed to prevent the federal government from recognizing and respecting legal unions between same-sex couples.\n\nIt did not. It never could have.\n\nDennis Hollingsworth was the multimillionaire behind California’s Proposition 8, which undermined the state’s prior recognition of marriage equality. Hollingsworth also sought to block same-sex marriages through litigation and judicial activism. Hollingsworth and others like him have made it clear that they don’t believe gays and lesbians are entitled to any of the same rights that heterosexuals are. But they are wrong. The Defense of Marriage Act, with its antigay animus, was overturned today by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed that there is no state right, or rational basis, for discriminating against gays, lesbians, and their families. The Constitution is and must be applied to everyone equally.\n\nBecause of DOMA, the federal government was prohibited from recognizing the legal unions of gay and lesbian couples. It was supposed to be the perfect tool for gays and lesbians to never achieve equality.\n\nBut it was not.\n\nWhen gays and lesbians challenged the Defense of Marriage Act, and argued that the law and its enforcement violated their rights under the Constitution, they prevailed.\n\nThe case that brought down the Defense of Marriage Act was United States v. Windsor, and Edie Windsor prevailed, despite the best efforts of some very retrograde forces, including House Speaker John Boehner, who used Congress to defend DOMA and the bigotry of the past.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a strong, clear ruling that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional. And it also said DOMA was unconstitutional because of its animus toward gay people.\n\n“It is proper to hold that, at a minimum, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the right to marry, or the substantial equivalent thereof, be afforded to same-sex couples,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy. “DOMA, as applied to same-sex couples legally married under the laws of their State, violates the Equal Protection Clause because it does not serve a legitimate governmental purpose.”\n\nAnd Kennedy concluded:\n\nDOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, violates equal protection and is therefore unconstitutional. The Court’s disposition of this case makes clear that the Constitution’s guarantee of equality is “forceful” and “cannot be denied.” The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nWhen gay and lesbian couples sought federal benefits for their families, they met resistance, and in some cases hostility. For example, if a same-sex couple was married in New York, that couple would receive benefits. But if the couple traveled to Maryland, they would be treated as unmarried, even if they were legally married. There was no basis for treating same-sex couples differently. And yet, the Defense of Marriage Act codified that discrimination.\n\nThe Court recognized that. It held that DOMA violated the Constitution because it was passed with animus toward gay people, and because there was no legitimate justification for the law’s discriminatory purpose. The Court did not simply overturn the Defense of Marriage Act because it decided that it did not like the law. The Court actually agreed that the law was flawed. It agreed that it should not be the law.\n\nDennis Hollingsworth is gone. DOMA is gone.\n\nAnd there is a lot of work to be done to extend the Constitution’s guarantees to gays, lesbians, and their families.

Well in the case of Social Media, that's becoming even harder to do.\n\nThe great Peter Brierley offers up an explanation.\n\nOne definition of the word \"noise\" is \"unwanted sound\". It is not uncommon to find people describing internet, TV, radio, newspaper, and magazine content as \"noise\". But this is too simplistic a view.\n\nAlthough social media can be treated as a one-way information broadcast medium, it is rarely the case that anything ever broadcasts uninterrupted. If a message does get through, it will normally be met with a response that is not necessarily a reply. These can be from people who like what they are hearing, who are not so sure, or who are totally against the message.\n\nFor those who love social media, there are great benefits to be had. For others, the noise gets in the way of their communications strategy, with some even going so far as to say that social media is useless.<|endoftext|>Update, 1:05 p.m.:\n\nFour students who police said planned to shoot students at a high school and a middle school are in custody in central Iowa, officials said.\n\nThe juveniles were taken into custody after a long-term investigation of a plot to carry out a mass shooting at an Ankeny, Iowa, school, said police in the Des Moines suburb.

His life is changed forever when he and his mother are abducted by sea raiders.\n\n\n\nMaureen Hancock's Gift of the Gods is based on the Greek myths and a thoroughly modern sensibility. Her hero is Perseus, a prince of Argos, whose life is changed forever when he and his mother are abducted by sea raiders. Wrenched from his idyllic home and beloved mother, Perseus is taken into slavery by the king of an island at the edge of the world. Here he meets other boys, and among them one boy in particular who will become his best friend. Separated from his mother, surrounded by enemies, and frightened for his life, Perseus must learn to survive, to fight, to be ruthless if necessary, and most of all, to overcome his fear and self-doubt.\n\n\n\nWhen the king of his adopted land asks him to return a favor he's done him, Perseus begins his adventure as he sets sail on the first of many dangerous voyages. In the course of his travels, Perseus will visit the far-flung corners of the known world: he will be shipwrecked on a distant island, captured by an exotic queen, befriend the gods, and battle sea monsters. Most of all, he will learn who he is and what he can accomplish when he relies on his own courage and strength, and the gifts the gods have given him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCategoría Sub-Categoría Juvenil Juvenil - Literatura Juvenil\n\nISBN 13:\n\n9780895983766\n\nISBN 10:\n\n0895983769\n\nFormato:\n\nPapel Delgado (Paperback)\n\nIdioma:\n\nInglés\n\nPáginas:\n\n171\n\nTamaño:\n\n8.50\" l x 5.50\" w x 0.80\" h\n\nEdades:\n\n9 - 12\n\nGrado:<|endoftext|>Proteins called histones wrap DNA, but instead of insulating it from noise they seem to amplify it.\n\nTrans"
"Google announced plans today to acquire satellite imaging firm Skybox Imaging, for an undisclosed amount. Skybox's 40-member team will continue to work from their headquarters in Mountain View, California, and also in Washington D.C., where they have worked to lobby for the rights to send up its own satellites. Skybox has already launched two of these satellites, the second of which was actually the first to use SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket to deliver it into space.\n\nGoogle wants access to these satellites\n\nSkybox is best known for the stunning, high-definition images it takes of the earth's surface from space. The company has managed to make these images available for free through a platform it calls, simply, \"Skybox Imaging.\" This platform hosts images that span the entire earth's surface, though the company's satellites are still limited in the amount of territory they can cover. But now, by working with Google, Skybox could gain the power to reach a much larger audience.\n\nSkybox's satellites are also equipped with video capabilities, so Google could use the company's tech to improve the search quality of Google Maps. Google has made its investment in Skybox public alongside the release of a video (see above) that shows a demonstration of what the technology can do. The company says that it intends to start using Skybox's imagery in the next few months, starting with Google Maps, and to later incorporate it into its cloud-based Earth mapping product, Google Earth.<|endoftext|>It was only a matter of time before the cult of the ‘dad bod’ took the world by storm. The internet has been replete with articles, blog posts, and photos for the past few weeks, celebrating the ‘dad bod’ as the end-all-be-all of male physique. The dad bod is not an insult. It’s not an apology for your body. The dad bod is a celebration. It is a fun, refreshing movement that shows that men can enjoy their bodies at any size.\n\nForget about your 6-pack. Forget about your thigh gap. Your tummy is supposed to be flabby and your arms are supposed to jiggle when you run. It’s all in good fun. If you can let go of your obsession with perfection, you will find happiness in your natural body. It’s only then that you can start focusing on your life instead of your body.\n\nThe ‘dad bod’ is a bold statement that the new standard of male physique is one that embraces who you are and what you have. It’s a celebration of the soft, the jiggly, the flabby, the flaccid, and the unshaven. That’s what makes you unique. That’s what makes you human. It is about your character, personality, and soul. And it is about your spirit.\n\nLet’s take a look at what people are saying about the ‘dad bod’ movement:\n\n“You know, the dad bod? It’s kind of a big deal. It’s become a sort of cultural milestone, a touchstone for a certain kind of body acceptance. The dad bod says, “I go to the gym occasionally, but I also drink heavily on the weekends and enjoy eating eight slices of pizza at a time.” The dad bod says, “I’m a grown man, and my body tells the story of the life I’ve lived.” It’s not about having your cake and eating it too. It’s about living your life and loving your body.” — Max Joseph, Huffington Post “If you’re in shape, keep it up. If you’re not, it’s time to re-evaluate what’s really important. In reality, your life is probably more interesting than the guy who has been going to the gym for the last 5 years and has abs.” — Paul, The Dad Bod “I’m a dad. I’m not quite old enough to be a dad, but I am old enough to be a dad, and that’s how I look. It’s not that I’m a lazy person. It’s not that I don’t care about my appearance. I’m just not that concerned about it. The reality is I probably spend too much time on it.” — Sean, The Dad Bod “The current and future ‘bods’ should be proud that they have rejected the socially-dictated ideals of an unrealistic body type, and embraced the physical reality that they are, in fact, human.” — Justin Stenstrom, founder of Social Karma\n\nMen, it’s time to celebrate who you are. Let go of your obsession with the ‘perfect body’. There is no perfect body. Celebrate your own body, for it is as good as it can be. Rejoice!<|endoftext|>We at the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) have been trying to answer this question ever since we were formed a decade ago.\n\nWe've published three detailed manifestos, a comprehensive programme of change for Scotland. Yet we know that all our work will not be enough to build a new society. This can only be done by the people themselves, once they have been freed from the shackles of class rule.\n\nOur efforts to inspire and mobilise people have resulted in significant advances over the last decade. We have been a key contributor to the change in Scotland, from when the independence referendum was an almost taboo subject, to its high-profile status today.\n\nSince the 2014 vote we have worked to win support for independence among working-class people, and help lay the foundations of a new socialist force. Our manifesto, 'Change the World, Start with Scotland', which we launched just two months ago, describes how we are creating the conditions for that party to emerge.\n\nOur role in this process will be to help build a strong movement, mobilising thousands of people to build a socialist Scotland. This movement will be led by ordinary people, but it will also need a party to organise it, to help take it forward.\n\nOur next step is to stand candidates in the council elections in May, and stand in as many seats as possible in the Westminster election in June. As we grow, we'll stand in elections at every level – from Westminster and Holyrood to councils and local boards.\n\nWhen the independence referendum was first proposed, it was only because the ruling class was fearful of the SNP achieving an outright majority in the Scottish Parliament, something that seemed likely at the time.\n\nSince then, the SNP has become a central pillar of the establishment. Its focus is on capturing the maximum possible number of Westminster seats, so it can be a key player in the UK establishment. The SNP has been careful to distance itself from the more radical demands of the independence movement, limiting the question to one of national status.\n\nAs a result, those people who voted Yes have been left high and dry. There is no movement to give them a voice. Only the SSP is capable of that. We believe that in order to create a fair and equal society, Scotland needs to build a movement that will make real change.\n\nWhile the SNP can gain power by appealing to a more conservative section of the population, we need a bolder, radical approach. Only the SSP offers a real alternative to austerity and cuts, and a vision for a more equal and prosperous society.\n\nOur vision is for a socialist Scotland: a modern democratic republic based on the common ownership of the means of production, and the principle \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs\".\n\nWe are socialists because we know that the old capitalist system will always mean inequality and poverty. Only a new, democratic and socialist society can tackle the problems people face, from housing to low pay, from growing debt to climate change.\n\nWe have to take a stand for what we believe in. We have to be ready to show that a better world is possible, and the only way to do that is to offer a radical alternative to the mainstream political parties. That is the responsibility we have to take.<|endoftext|>Canada's telecom regulator on Monday slapped BCE Inc.'s Bell unit with a $1.3-million fine for violating wireless code rules and ordered the company to pay $150,000 in customer compensation.\n\nIn a statement, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission said it issued the administrative monetary penalties to Bell Mobility Inc. in two separate decisions, both of which stemmed from investigations into Bell's sales practices.\n\nThe CRTC said that it received multiple complaints from customers who were either told by Bell representatives that wireless services were not available at their location, when in fact they were, or were offered the company's services and entered into a contract without knowing the proper cancellation procedure.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe commission said it received complaints that Bell representatives told customers they had to pay full cancellation fees – rather than a pro-rated amount – if they cancelled their wireless contracts before the end of their minimum three-year term.\n\nIt also received complaints that customers who bought discounted phones with a three-year contract were charged higher cancellation fees than customers who bought discounted phones with a two-year contract.\n\n\"While Bell was quick to correct its errors and implement measures to prevent these issues from recurring, the commission considers that the significant number of complaints that it received about these issues indicates that there was a problem with Bell's training, policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with the code,\" the CRTC said.\n\n\"It is clear that the corrective actions taken by Bell were not effective in addressing these issues.\"\n\nBell said Monday that it"

They're beginning to use cloud technology to build more focused suites,\" says Martha O'Brien, a senior research analyst at IDC. \"Cloud enables companies to focus more on their core competencies.\"\n\nIn addition, O'Brien said that midsize companies are using a mix of on-premise and cloud software, while larger companies are almost exclusively using cloud solutions. She noted that the more mature the industry, the more companies tend to use cloud.\n\n\"Midsize companies are open to different technologies, including cloud,\" she says.\n\nThe findings are in line with what the report found to be the most popular ERP suites in 2013.\n\nAccording to the IDC report, SAP continues to be the most widely used ERP suite. Its market share grew 8.1 percent from 2012, to 44 percent. Oracle's share grew 3.8 percent to 27.3 percent, while Microsoft's share fell 5.7 percent to 11.8 percent. Other vendors, such as Salesforce.com and NetSuite, together gained 4.7 percent of the market, reaching 17.2 percent.\n\nIn terms of purchasing decisions, midsize companies are concerned about cost, vendor selection, functional fit, and integration with existing systems. They also want to ensure that the software will support their future business needs.<|endoftext|>Radar To New Bedford Inches Closer\n\nOver the past few months, John Cimini, owner of XBIX Inc., has been putting the finishing touches on a plan to bring XBIX-TV, a 24-hour all-movie channel, to New Bedford and the Tri-County area.\n\nNEW BEDFORD — The start of a new television station is getting closer.\n\n``This is a dream I've had for many years, but I've never been able to do anything about it,'' he said. ``I started this project a year ago, and we're almost at the end of the tunnel.''\n\nA 1980 New Bedford High School graduate, Cimini said he's had the idea for an all-movie channel since childhood. ``I used to love watching the movies on Channel 22 (WPRI) and channel 20 (WNAC). So when Channel 22 went off the air, I thought, `I could do this,''' he said.\n\nCimini said he was sure it would be a hit. ``It seems there are a lot of people who like the movies and don't have anything to do on a Saturday night but watch the same four or five movies.''\n\nCimini worked with several firms before settling on Global Video as his programmer. He said Global Video owns an extensive library of old movies, including some that aren't even out on video.\n\n``The movies we pick are good. They're not just movies that are out on video,'' he said.\n\nWith the programming, Cimini said, he wants to create a new ``golden era'' of TV programming. He said the channel would be the equivalent of a trip back in time to the TV of the 1960s and '70s, when the three major networks aired shows like ``Bonanza,'' ``Dragnet'' and ``Mission Impossible.''\n\nThe channel will also show movies from the 1980s, but there will be a bigger emphasis on older films. Cimini said XBIX-TV will also show two newer movies in addition to older movies.\n\n``The new movies will be really new,'' he said. ``There will be more recent stuff from 2000 or 2001.''\n\nIn addition, the channel will show some news and sports, as well as cartoons.\n\nCimini said XBIX-TV would operate like the ABC and CBS stations do. Programming would be provided by Global Video. The station would be local, showing local ads and having a local staff.\n\nCimini said the channel's mission would be to create jobs and help local charities.\n\n``The channel will also help local charities. For every hour of programming we put on, we'll give $1 for a good cause,'' he said. ``We're not saying which charities yet.''\n\nCimini said he also plans to put some of the station's proceeds into a charitable fund for the station's employees.<|endoftext|>Een aantal maanden geleden bespraken we op onze site dat wij van mening zijn dat de NBN-achtige glasvezelproducten zouden moeten worden uitgebreid naar kleinere dorpen in Nederland. Zorgen over de kosten die deze zouden veroorzaken speelden daarbij een rol, en daarom waren we het er over eens dat de markt er voor moet worden vrijgemaakt. Dit om te zorgen dat een laagdrempelige snelle glasvezelproductie kan worden gerealiseerd, ook in kleinere dorpen. Er zijn er immers die toch zeggen dat dit er niet zou komen omdat de concurrentie en het niet marktwerken hier in de weg zou staan.\n\nOpenen van de markt\n\nWij waren het dan ook al eerder van mening dat het Openstelsel van KPN de markt zou moeten openen en daarom waren wij het ook al eerder met de Raad van Commissarissen van KPN eens. Dit is echter nu wel zo, door de vrijgave van de kabelmarkt. En nu is het dus ook zo dat de laatste stap is gezet. Op dit moment wordt al een glasvezelnetwerk voor ons ingericht, en er wordt nu dus een markt van klanten opgebouwd.\n\nMinder dorpen voorlopig\n\nEchter zijn er nog niet heel veel mensen die een abonnement hebben. Het is namelijk zo dat als je bijvoorbeeld in Gelderland woont, je in een aantal dorpen van KPN nu gebruik kan maken van glasvezel. Dat kunnen er op dit moment bijvoorbeeld 12 of 13 zijn.

Dat komt er namelijk nog bij dat deze dorpen er dan ook aan toe moeten zijn om in te kunnen stappen.

A small number of Normans had earlier befriended future Anglo-Saxon King of England, Edward the Confessor, and his claim to the throne, and had helped him return to England in 1041. When Edward died in 1066, the Normans ignored his heir, the dispossessed Edgar Ætheling, and brought Harold Godwinson to the throne, thereby starting the Norman conquest of England. Over the following years, Norman kings conquered and assimilated some of the native ruling classes; some of whom, like William the Conqueror, adopted these new \"Norman\" cultural practices, manners and ideas, became \"Anglicised\" and gradually lost their distinctiveness. For a time Normans – and the Anglo-Normans – ruled a vast kingdom, \"Christendom\", including England, Wales, southern Ireland, Normandy, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, Aquitaine, Toulouse, Provence, and more. The Norman ruling class spoke Norman French and, in England, used the Anglo-Norman language.\n\nIn 1130, under King Henry I, laid claim to the English crown, which was denied him by the English. The war that followed was known as the \"Norman Conquest\" and lasted for many decades, establishing Normandy as a power with strong influence in both France and England. The Channel Islands, as well as part of Maine, were ceded to the King of France in return for his aid in this campaign. By 1204, the English had lost almost all of their territories in France, with the exception of Gascony, but political ties between the two countries were maintained through the English kings granting fiefdoms to French lords, many of whom were Englishmen, who held lands as \"tenants-in-chief\". \n\nThe Norman aristocracy spoke Norman French and first established a large territorial power base in eastern Normandy. By 1100, with England largely subdued, a further significant expansion of Norman power took place through the acquisition of the \"Duchy of Brittany\" and surrounding territory by William II of England, first Duke of Normandy, the second-in-line to the English throne, as well as through marriage to the daughter of the king of England, Matilda of Flanders. By the time of William's death in 1087, he was the dominant landholder and most powerful prince in England. His widow, Matilda of Flanders, married the next English king, Henry I, in 1100. When Henry died in 1135, Matilda continued to rule England as regent for their young son, King Henry II, while her half-brother, Robert, became \"Duke of Normandy\", which he ruled until 1144.\n\nIn 1152 the Treaty of Wallingford stipulated that the English crown would pass through the female line. Stephen of Blois and Henry of Anjou, the great grandsons of William the Conqueror, faced each other across the \"Angevin Empire\", in France and in England. Each claimed to be the rightful king, resulting in a period known as the \"Anarchy\". The reigns of both Stephen and Henry saw major changes in the structure of government, with Stephen introducing the innovations of the \"Charter of Liberties\" and founding the \"Curia Regis\" or Royal Council.\n\nIn the following century, the Anglo-Norman state was attacked by the Scots from the north, the Flemish from the west and the Irish from the south. The Anglo-Norman realm would, in the end, prove to be the survivor, the last vestige of Anglo-Saxon rule in England. The destruction of the Anglo-Norman elite by the Scottish and Welsh revolts during the Wars of the Roses in the fifteenth century, and the longstanding feud between the houses of York and Lancaster, removed most of the Norman aristocracy, leaving the English monarchy as the major power in the British Isles. The end of the Anglo-Norman dynasties in England also marks the start of the \"Middle Ages\" in that country.\n\nThe Normans adopted many customs, such as fashions in clothing, and other items of \"luxury\", which they introduced to the court of Edward the Confessor, but most importantly, the Norman Conquest had a profound impact on language in England. The Norman language, now known as the Norman language or Anglo-Norman, had been introduced"

He is the son of Linda S. (née Reiss) and Robert Storch. Storch has two brothers, David and Richard. His father was the CEO of Gimbels department store. Storch attended The Dwight School in New York City, graduating in 1973. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams College in 1978, where he was a member of the Theta Chi Fraternity. He went on to earn an M.B.A. from Columbia Business School in 1982.\n\nStorch joined Bloomingdale's in 1980. He has been the president of Saks since February 2000 and became its CEO in November 2001.\n\nStorch's two biggest ideas at Saks have been Saks OFF 5th, a discount offshoot of the brand, and \"The Shop at Saks,\" a ground-floor boutique on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, it was reported that Storch would be leaving Saks Fifth Avenue to become CEO of Macy's, replacing Terry Lundgren, who is staying at the company as chairman.\n\nStorch was named as president and CEO of Macy's on July 28, 2011, and assumed office on August 4, 2011. In January 2012, Storch introduced the New York concept to the Minneapolis-based department store chain.\n\nOn March 6, 2012, Storch led the Macy's presentation to department store and specialty store investors in New York City. The presentation included more details about Storch's efforts to revitalize Macy's and his plan to roll out a loyalty program throughout the Macy's stores.\n\nStorch's tenure was marked by both a strong market share and a commitment to growing the online business. In early 2016, Storch negotiated a long-term deal with Amazon to improve the online shopping experience for customers and to allow Amazon to handle some of Macy's most popular brands like Levi's, Disney, and Ugg. However, the market share increase came at a cost of earnings, which dropped from 2014 to 2016. This was in part due to a commitment to sprucing up the in-store shopping experience by adding more services like tailors and restaurants, as well as the cost of opening new stores and closing underperforming ones. On March 13, 2017, Macy's announced that Storch was stepping down from the company.\n\nStorch was one of five executives who appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on September 26, 2009, to discuss the \"Buy American\" phenomenon.

El filo de los dos, that starts in the world of arts and literature, becomes a very well-set-out thriller novel, that stands out in the Venezuelan literature of the 2000s and that builds a very original plot, that mixes elements from other genres: literature, philosophy, music, sociology and thriller. The author manages to provoke the reader, a reader that doesn’t doubt in reading literary, historical and philosophical texts, to complete the reading of the text. The research proposes a historical-philosophical reading of the work, from the transculturation theory, through a methodological bet on interpretation and complementary reading of the text.\n\n1. Introducción\n\n1.1. La invención de la literatura venezolana\n\nLa invención de la literatura venezolana está estrechamente ligada a la labor de José Gil Fortoul y Justo Sierra (1848-1912). A partir de una posición a favor de la educación universal, Fortoul –un hombre de clase media que, a pesar de haber terminado sus estudios en Europa, no renunció a los ideales de su país ni a la realidad venezolana– fundó en 1877 la primera escuela de letras en Venezuela y lideró el intento por unificar el sistema educativo de la nación. Su última obra, Historia de la enseñanza en Venezuela, terminada pocos días antes de su muerte, no solo describe el desarrollo de la educación, sino también sugiere la vigencia de una obra literaria en la nación: \"La vida no es completa si no es cultivada con las ciencias y las letras; en ella hay una porción de la grandeza y la belleza de las ciencias, la magnificencia de las letras\".\n\nEsta búsqueda de la grandeza y de la belleza de las ciencias y las letras, también estaba presente en el gobierno de Justo Sierra, quien en 1893 creó la Dirección General de Instrucción Pública, estableciendo la educación primaria gratuita. Pero, especialmente, Sierra fundó la primera Escuela de Bellas Artes en 1892 y propuso una política educativa para la formación de artistas venezolanos. La mayor parte de los primeros artistas venezolanos –hombres como Alberto Peñaranda (1857-1924), Juan Cristóbal Jiménez (1867-1947) y Juan Lovera (1870-1944), así como el grupo más importante de mujeres pintoras, formado por Mercedes Ayala de Vengoechea (1855-1922), Carmen Calzadilla (1859-1931) y, sobre todo, Lina Domínguez (1859-1934)– fueron educados en esta institución, lo que le dio a la nación artistas conocidos internacionalmente y también al país una base artística para una identidad nacional.\n\nLuego de la muerte de Sierra, se realizó un intento por iniciar una revolución en Venezuela, en 1907, que incluyó una propuesta artística que buscaba tener un impacto mayor en la formación de una identidad nacional. La primera propuesta para \"Inventar\" una literatura venezolana se hizo en un ensayo titulado \"En busca de una literatura nacional\", de Gabriel Alfonzo (1864-1944), quien argumentó en contra de la vigencia de la literatura hispanoamericana en el territorio venezolano. Pero, desde esta postura, también creó una propuesta para una literatura nacional: una literatura de la imaginación, una literatura del \"dibujo extemporáneo\", del \"adorno\" que \"ha de ir seguido de una obra seria, la de fortalecer nuestras instituciones\". En los años siguientes, se escribieron y publicaron obras para concretar esta propuesta, como El libro de Gervasio (1912) de Alberto Barrera Tyszka (1882-1916), El poeta errante (1919) de Ricardo Silva-Herzog (1876-1953), o El cuarto de Magdalena (1921) de Arturo Uslar Pietri (1904-1995), pero la literatura nacional se convirtió en una realidad al escribirse La vida maravillosa (1925) y Panorama de Venezuela (1926) de Rómulo Gallegos (1884-1969). Gallegos también escribió, y publicó, Pobre negro (1935), la primera novela venezolana con un tema étnico.\n\nEstas nuevas invenciones literarias, también podrían ser consideradas como invenciones de historia. En otras palabras, las obras, escritas desde una posición nacionalista, intentaron la reescritura de la historia venezolana desde una nueva perspectiva: La historia de Lope de Aguirre (1929), de Arturo Uslar Pietri, intenta demostrar que en el caso de esta figura de la historia venezolana, el pueblo –el grupo étnico que integraba la nación– hizo lo que el gobierno no hizo. Esta misma reescritura de la historia, también se hace en Panorama de Venezuela, en la cual se documenta la lucha de Simón Bolívar (1783-1830) contra la corona española. De esta manera, también se concreta una invención de la historia de la literatura venezolana, puesto que se escriben obras que \"simulan\" la literatura hispanoamericana, sin embargo, son originales en su estructura y vocabulario, logrando expresar el imaginario venezolano.\n\nDesde esta perspectiva, la novela negra sería una invención de literatura, una manera de reescribir la literatura venezolana de la forma en que Gallegos la vio, pero esta reescritura también sería una invención de la historia del país, una manera de aceptar que, en la formación de la nación, el imaginario y el pueblo también son fundamentales.

"Long held in awe as one of the most mysterious and haunting artefacts of ancient Egypt, the Great Pyramid of Giza has just given up one of its biggest secrets.\n\nAnd you don't even need an Indiana Jones hat to find it.\n\nThe secret, that has baffled archaeologists for centuries, is the 'burial chamber' within the monument. It's only the third ever discovered, and it's literally a hidden gem.\n\nMUST-SEE: This Was the Last Message Ever Received From the First Polar Satellite Launch\n\n\n\nAlthough many experts have theorised the purpose of the chamber, there has never been any solid evidence for it. The first was uncovered in 1837 by the British traveler Richard William Howard Vyse, but was then sealed again. The second was uncovered in the late 19th century by an Italian archaeologist.\n\nBut the latest, discovered by British architect and Egyptologist Dr. Kate Spence, was actually found with little more than a metal detector.\n\n\"The chamber may also help to confirm that the Great Pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu, commonly known as Cheops,\" says Dr Spence.\n\n\"Such a purpose is written on the walls of the pyramid's so-called Subterranean Chamber, which can only be reached via a tunnel.\n\n\"The first clues to the possible location of the entrance to this tunnel are the marks on the wall of the Queen's Chamber.\"\n\nUsing a metal detector, Dr Spence discovered an anomaly in a corner of the room. It was only after researchers started cleaning the area that the discovery was made.\n\nDr. Spence told LiveScience that the anomaly was an open space, an empty spot in the rocks.\n\n\"Once we removed all the broken debris, we could see that the 'openings' were cavities, possibly unexplored cavities, in the walls.\"\n\nThe team of researchers then followed the ancient tunnels, eventually finding the hidden door that led to the burial chamber.\n\n\"You can actually see the different grains of sandstone,\" Dr. Spence said, \"and there's a redder rock. And there's a certain type of black rock that is definitely not in the natural pyramid, which might be the signature of a particular stone that was brought from elsewhere to plug the shafts.\"\n\nThe chamber itself is tiny. It's 3.5 feet wide, 17 feet long and 8.6 feet high.\n\nBut its significance is huge.\n\n\"The architecture of the pyramid suggests it was designed to focus on this small hidden room, so there is a good chance there may be something in there,\" Dr. Spence said.\n\nThe next step is for researchers to take a look inside.\n\nVia LiveScience<|endoftext|>After months of wandering the area, U.S. troops stationed in South Korea have a new place to call home.\n\nThe U.S. Army in South Korea has unveiled a new, bigger installation in Pyeongtaek.\n\nThere will be three phases to the project. The first one is completed and includes office space, housing, a fitness center and a medical clinic.\n\n\"It was really nice to see the expansion of the troops that was here,\" says Army Specialist Nick Collins, who's stationed at Camp Humphreys. \"We've been just on the third floor for two years now. Now we have the whole building.\"\n\nU.S. Forces Korea says by the end of 2018, there will be more than twice the amount of buildings than what was there before.<|endoftext|>Buckhead Atlanta is known for some of the top restaurants in the country, but now one is being recognized as the best in the world.\n\nL'Atelier de Joel Robuchon has received a two-star rating from the prestigious Michelin Guide, which is its highest rating.\n\nThe guide's 2015 edition named just 34 restaurants around the world with the two-star rating, and the only restaurant in the U.S. to receive it was the chef's own spot in Las Vegas.\n\nRobuchon's flagship location is at the Four Seasons in Midtown. L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is located on the ground floor of the Four Seasons Atlanta.\n\n\"The fact that it was his first outpost in the U.S. was a huge story,\" says Edward Lee, chef and partner at 610 Magnolia in Louisville. \"Everybody was in disbelief that one of the most important chefs in the world, the most important chefs in the world had a restaurant in the U.S.\"\n\nRobuchon announced in October that he would be closing both of his Las Vegas locations. He has more than 40 restaurants around the world.\n\nChef Lee was one of the first Atlanta chefs to receive a Michelin star. His restaurant 610 Magnolia also has two.<|endoftext|>P. G. Wodehouse (1881-1975) was one of the most widely read humorists of the twentieth century, and by the end of his life he had become a literary legend. But Wodehouse achieved his fame by accident. He was born in England to parents who were French-speaking English citizens living in Paris, and in 1899, at the age of eighteen, he took a job at a bank. A short time later, he began writing articles and short stories for London newspapers. In 1902, he began working for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in London. Wodehouse remained there for forty-three years. His first short story collection, Tales of St. Austin's, was published in 1902. His most successful early work was Piccadilly Jim (1915). In 1921, he became a contributor to the American humor magazine, Judge, and, in 1923, his short story collection Laughing Gas was published in the United States. Between 1925 and 1930, Wodehouse wrote a series of stories for the London Evening Standard about a bumbling but irresistible English butler named Jeeves. These stories were collected into a novel entitled, The Inimitable Jeeves, which became the first of ten Jeeves novels. The following year, Wodehouse moved from London to the United States to be closer to his American publishers and his many American fans. He became a U.S. citizen in 1955. During his career, he wrote and published some ninety-eight books. Though he is often compared to his friend, P. G. T. Beauregard, and though he had a special affinity for writing about the English aristocracy, Wodehouse's humor had a universal appeal. He once said that his humor was based on one of his own character traits: \"I find myself more often than not trying to get out of things. . . . It's not laziness. It's the fact that I'm not at all sure of my capacity to get into them. It's the same thing in writing. I never know quite how a story is going to go till I start writing it. I can't plan the whole thing out beforehand.\" Wodehouse continued to write until a few years before his death in 1975. His son, the actor and director, Blandford Wodehouse, adapted several of his father's stories for the BBC and the stage, and a Wodehouse play, Happy Birthday, was also performed in the United States in the late 1970s.<|endoftext|>I am working with the Redhat linux 14.1 and VirtualBox .

"We know a few months ago Marvel started going after their fans for using file sharing programs and a few days ago they were spotted trying to use webbots to catch people that had downloaded some of their movie clips. Well, some of the websites that use the file sharing program have already reported a number of takedown notices.\n\nThe first one comes from Mininova.org, a site that allows users to upload and download music, movies and television shows. The website is being targeted for three different clips, one from “Thor,” one from “Captain America” and one from “Avengers.” The notice that Mininova received states that these clips were filmed in a movie theater and posted on the website and it is a clear infringement of copyright. This is also the first time I’ve seen a takedown notice for footage filmed in a movie theater. They even went so far as to say that there were signs and warnings posted around the theater prohibiting the use of recording devices during the screening.\n\nThe second one comes from TorrentFreak.com, a website that allows users to upload and download files from the public domain. They have also received a notice for a clip from “Thor,” but also for a clip from “Iron Man 2” and “Captain America.” Like Mininova, the notice for the second clip mentioned that the movie was screened in a movie theater and the clip was being posted without permission. They also said that there was a sign at the theater stating that recording devices are not allowed. The notice for the “Captain America” clip also mentions that the clip was posted for profit.\n\nThe third and final notice comes from 4Shared.com, a site that allows users to upload and download movies, television shows, video games and more. This website is currently hosting a clip from “Thor,” a clip from “Captain America” and a clip from “Avengers.” Like the other websites, the notice also mentions that the movie was screened in a movie theater and the clip is being posted without permission. The notice for the “Thor” clip mentions that there were warnings posted around the theater prohibiting the use of recording devices. They also mention that the clip was filmed during a premiere and that they have taken measures to protect their property.\n\nIf these websites take these notices seriously then they may want to just take down the clips in question. This is why we never link to videos or pictures of leaked footage. We don’t want to see any of you getting into trouble with your favorite websites because they may not be as hardcore as we are when it comes to being anti-movie piracy.\n\nAs of right now, we do not know how much it will cost these websites to fight the notices. So, we will continue to keep an eye on this as it develops.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these takedown notices? Does Marvel have a right to protect their property?

The island of Shikotan (漁港) is currently occupied by U.S. forces, but the U.S. Government agrees to return Shikotan to Japanese control and withdraw all troops in exchange for a letter of Japanese surrender and control of the Kuril Islands.\n\nIn addition, the government secretly requests U.S. help to turn Shikotan into a military base. In this case, they are going to give the Kuril Islands to the U.S. to build a military base there instead. In exchange, Japan will continue to get help from the U.S. for as long as they need it. This plan to hand over the Kuril Islands to the U.S. in exchange for their support to turn Shikotan into a military base is strongly opposed by the Japanese public, but the situation becomes critical when Russia, fearing that the U.S. will control Japan, sends a military force to Shikotan in an attempt to seize the island. In the middle of the battle, the Japanese government is taken over by a group of Japanese nationalists who plan to destroy all Japanese military bases and surrender to the U.S. When a mysterious young man comes to Shikotan, the Japanese Self-Defense Force, and even a U.S. army, are swept up into the battle.<|endoftext|>\n\n\n\nRelated Pictures Pictures of American Made (2017) Movie not found\n\nGenres Comedy\n\nFull Plot Hank, a washed-up pilot turned low-level drug smuggler, has always dreamed of flying the world's fastest plane. When his criminal career stalls, he finally gets his chance to fulfill his lifelong ambition. But he'll need a copilot, and a dead man's license, to get the job. A ridiculous, high-flying adventure with Tom Cruise as the hard-partying pilot with more lives than a cat. JaiA. Trivia Thomas Cruise Mapother IV is actually the first of seven children born to Mary Lee Pfeiffer and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, though he was raised as an only child. Tom's father Thomas Cruise Mapother III is a screenwriter and producer, and is also an actor and producer. There is a character named \"Tom\" in \"American Made\", which is written by Thomas Cruise Mapother III. The airfield in the movie is called \"Benson Field\", which is also the name of the airfield that was used in the TV show \"Airwolf\". The airfield is now a real-life aviation museum. The building housing the airfield is actually the former headquarters of Monsanto Chemical Company, a company purchased by Bayer AG in 2002. The crew used the underground bunker as their gym. The helicopter used in the film is a Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin 2, which is the civilian version of the Dauphin, the helicopter used in the German Navy. Tom Cruise's piloting the plane without an instructor's license in the movie is not actually illegal in the United States; however, if the person who had the license died while operating the plane, the pilot would be forced to surrender the license until the official investigation is complete.

I want to get back in the ring and get that world title back. I feel good.\n\n“I’ve done a bit of sparring and I’ve been working with my strength and conditioning coach, so I’m feeling strong and fresh. I’m getting my weight down slowly and doing a lot of sparring. I’m getting back to the Ricky Burns we all know and love.”\n\nIn his last fight, Burns was stopped inside a round by Vasyl Lomachenko. After the fight, the Scot announced he would quit the sport, but changed his mind after working on his defence and improving his confidence in the gym.\n\n“I’m glad to be back,” he continued. “I was feeling bad for a while. I had to step away and think things through, and take my time, but now I’m ready to fight again.\n\n“I’m looking forward to getting back in the ring, getting the weight down and then getting my chance to fight for another world title.\n\n“I’m going to be looking for a win and to impress. The good thing about boxing is that there are so many good fights to be made. I’m looking forward to getting in there with someone.\n\n“I know there’s a great fight with Lee Selby or Evgeny Gradovich to be made. I would love to be in a big fight like that at some point.”\n\nBoxing fans in Glasgow will see Burns back in action at The SSE Hydro on September 15.\n\nLeave A Comment\n\ncomments<|endoftext|>If you are planning to enroll in the University of Kentucky, you’ll have to be prepared for many challenges along the way.

China has responded with its own plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that the U.S. government will begin collecting tariffs on the $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on Sept. 24, with the tariffs to rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1.\n\nChina said Friday that it will hit back with retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods if Washington goes ahead with its latest tariff threat.\n\nIn a statement, China’s Commerce Ministry said, “If the U.S. side obstinately clings to its course and takes any new tariff measures against China, China will be forced to take countermeasures.”\n\nIt added, “The two sides’ trade and economic relations have been affected by the unilateral and trade protectionist measures from the U.S. side.”\n\nThe United States said Monday that it would impose tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nChina had earlier announced plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods, ranging from 5 to 10 percent.\n\nThe U.S. has been accusing China of stealing U.S. technology and trade secrets.\n\nThe two countries have been in negotiations for months over the trade dispute.\n\nU.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are holding talks in Washington this week. The two sides have little time left to reach a deal before a fresh round of tariffs takes effect.\n\nTrump has also threatened to hit China with tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese imports if China hits back with tariffs on U.S. agricultural products.<|endoftext|>\"You are the best writer I have seen and worked with.

To what extent does trade contribute to economic growth and what are the mechanisms that explain this relationship? This book is the result of an extensive collaboration between researchers in Brazil and France. It presents an innovative methodology that links trade and economic growth to the performance of the Brazilian manufacturing industry, a key sector of the Brazilian economy.\n\nThis book analyses the relationship between international trade and economic growth for a large sample of countries over more than two decades. By relying on a panel of time series, the authors of this volume are able to detect some of the mechanisms that contribute to explaining the impact of trade on economic growth. They identify the effects of trade on industrial development, economic inequality, and on the environment.\n\nThis book will be of particular interest to policy makers, academics and researchers with an interest in International Economics, Trade Policy, International Trade, Economic Development and Brazilian Politics.<|endoftext|>I feel fortunate to be surrounded by some of the most beautiful and breathtaking people on the planet. They come in all shapes and sizes, as well as ages. I believe that the majority of my friends are also kind, giving, loving people. They will usually say hello and show you some type of respect.\n\nI often think to myself that this world could be a better place if we all did just that. We would not be so quick to judge someone. We would not be so quick to condemn.\n\nThere is this lady that I see from time to time who I really believe needs to be spoken to. I do not know her, but it seems as though I know her very well. She’s a Caucasian woman who is somewhere between 40 and 50 years old. She is a bit heavier than I am, but not by much. She has a really short haircut and her hair is mostly grey. I have noticed her shopping in a few different stores in my area. In fact, I have seen her in about 5 different stores in the last few months. Every time I see her, she is walking.\n\nShe appears to be dressed for comfort, as opposed to style. She will wear sneakers, jeans, and a t-shirt. She is never in makeup or jewelry, which is very different than me.\n\nI have noticed that every time I see her, she is carrying a purse. I have also noticed that the purse she carries is never the same. Some of them are a good quality, but others seem to be quite worn. I have also noticed that she carries this purse everywhere. It is as if it is her only possession.\n\nI have been waiting for the right moment to talk to her, but the right moment has yet to present itself. She never makes eye contact with me and will turn the other way. She walks through the aisles of the stores, sometimes stopping to read a label or check out a sale.\n\nOne day she was carrying one of her shopping bags and decided to put it on the bench next to me. I believe she noticed that I was watching her. She quickly looked around and made eye contact with me. I immediately looked away and pretended to be busy. She picked up her bag and left in a hurry.\n\nI am not exactly sure what it is about this lady that intrigues me so much. Is it because she carries all her possessions in a bag? Is it because she seems so content with her appearance and the way she is living?\n\nWhat do you think about this? Would you talk to her?\n\nMy friend told me to be careful. She told me that I could make things worse for this lady. I know she is right. I know this lady is living her life the way she wants to. I know that her life is her own and that no one has the right to criticize her for the way she chooses to live.\n\nI just want to know her story. I just want to know who she is. I would also like to get to know her, to have a friendship with her. I want to know how she got to where she is and what her dreams are for her life. I feel that she is someone who could benefit from being around people. I also feel that I could benefit from being around her. I could help her in many ways, but it would be up to her to accept my help. I would want to do more for her, but I would not try to force her to do anything.\n\nWould you approach this lady? If you did, how would you do it? I would really love to hear your comments about this. I would also like to know your story. Have you ever approached a stranger in the store or out in public?<|endoftext|>“I have made this recipe several times.

The Echo was a surprise hit for Amazon when it debuted in late 2014. It even earned Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos a whopping $1.28 billion in the last quarter of 2016. But it was also a surprise hit when Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Black went on sale for Prime Day 2018. Each of those products has become Amazon's most successful product during the subsequent holiday season. So be wary of the too-good-to-be-true pricing for the smart speaker in July. Another smart speaker Amazon is sure to discount heavily on Prime Day is the Amazon Echo (2nd Generation). The speaker has already been heavily discounted multiple times, but there's always room for more savings. That's especially true as Apple is about to release its HomePod smart speaker. Every year, Amazon releases several new products to its Amazon Echo lineup, including Echo Buttons, Echo Connect, Echo Spot, Echo Sub, and more. If you've been thinking about jumping into the smart home world, then Prime Day is a great time to do it. While the prices of these items are unlikely to get any cheaper, at least you'll be able to save on the accessories you need to use them with, such as the smart plug and smart bulb. iPhone X A while back, you used to be able to find a 5-pound bag of Nestle Quick-Cooking Chocolate Morsels on Amazon for $22, which would make about 8 batches of fudge. Now? It's $5.59 for a 10-ounce bag. You might be tempted to think, \"Well, $5.59 still isn't that bad for fudge.\" But that would be before you consider the shipping: $6.30 for the fudge itself, plus $7.99 for shipping, plus whatever else you throw in your cart for good measure. (Hey, Prime membership means free shipping, right?) Within a few clicks, you can find yourself spending as much on shipping as you did on the fudge itself. And as for that Prime membership? It'll cost you $119, if you want to take full advantage of all the benefits, including streaming video, free two-day shipping, and Prime Music. In short, Amazon's insane shipping prices can add a huge chunk of change to the cost of your orders. Also note that Amazon prices can fluctuate a bit, so your mileage may vary. It's still worth it to keep an eye on Amazon, because you never know when it'll have a great one-day sale, like on Nestle chocolate. (You can also get free two-day shipping via Amazon Prime if you're a student, which means a lot of college students can order candy cheaply without worrying about that added shipping charge.)

They wanted to find out how many horsepower the system gives, so they put the race car on a dyno and with one push of a button the DRS was open. After it was closed again, they got to see how much more horsepower the DRS gives the car.\n\nThis feature was originally introduced on the 2013 F1 cars. On those cars the drag reduction system was only used in qualifying, because it did not give enough of an advantage during a race. The advantage it gives in terms of a lap time is about half a second, which is why it is not used during a race.\n\nDRS is a technology that has been used in motorsports for a long time. The system is very well known and has proven to be very effective on F1 cars, because it reduces drag, which is exactly what the name says. This also means that there is a lot less drag on the car. The drag is a negative effect on a race car and that is why there is so much emphasis on trying to minimize it. The system is operated by a switch and that is why it is called the drag reduction system.\n\nWith the DRS the speed of the car increases. This is a result of a reduction in drag and therefore the car will go faster. The system is operated by a switch that is placed in the cockpit. By pushing it a button, the rear wing will open up. This will increase the speed of the car by about 50 km/h and this is the amount of speed that is possible on a straight line.\n\nThis feature is often used on the pit straight. This is a part of the track that is straight and therefore a driver can gain a lot of speed in a short amount of time by using the drag reduction system. Because this system was used so much by the F1 drivers in qualifying sessions, the FIA decided to limit the use of it. Now, the system can only be used on straights. Also, in a qualifying session it is only allowed to be used at least once and for a maximum of six seconds per lap. This system can also be used when there is a safety car on the track.\n\nIt is important to know that the drag reduction system is only allowed to be used at speeds over 150 km/h. That is why it is used on straights and when there is a safety car on the track. In the 2013 season there were some talks about the use of DRS. The FIA even did some tests to see if they should allow it to be used in the races. Those tests showed that using it during a race is not a good idea. The reasons for this is that the effect it has on the cars is just too big. Also, it creates a different type of racing, which is not something that is really interesting to watch.\n\nBy Laura Van Geffen\n\nSources:\n\nDRS Feature\n\nAlpinestars\n\nDRS Feature\n\nIMS\n\nImage by Wikimedia Commons<|endoftext|>Album Review\n\nThe slow-grinding, bellowing, mean-as-all-get-out tones of Mike Spruill's drumming as the spine of the two-drummer Gov't Mule help anchor the band's soulful grooves. Spruill's powerful rumbling performances don't garner much attention, but his musicianship has been essential to the band's success for over a decade. With a list of credits that includes the Allman Brothers Band, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, John Mayall, Dickey Betts, and Little Feat, it's pretty clear he can be relied on for a solid groove and a punishing beat.\n\nIn the late '80s, Spruill's gigs with Warren Haynes and Jimmy Herring were more than just a great match. \"It was so much fun,\" he remembers, \"and we got to travel the world, play with all these great people, and get paid for it. I got my start playing with Jimmy and Warren and was fortunate enough to have my first gig with them and keep that gig for a while. We went through some changes and came up with the Gov't Mule thing, which has been a fantastic career for me. It's definitely something that has exceeded my expectations. I've been very fortunate to play with a lot of great people, too.\"\n\nSpruill, in turn, has provided his extensive musical history with a master class in the art of Southern rock. Even so, his own playing doesn't rely on Southern roots. Rather, it has become a kind of bluesy swing that's groove-oriented, putting his drumming in the same class as his many teacher's over the years. Spruill took some time from the road to talk to us about his musical beginnings, his time with Dickey Betts, and his place as one of the best"
"What is the origin of the term fire chief?\n\nNot sure, but I think I can narrow it down to two possibilites. In the days of horse drawn fire engines, the chief was referred to as the horse driver. This was, no doubt, because the chief had the only horse and he, therefore, drove the horse drawn engine. The horse was, of course, critical to the operation of the department, and the chief became known as the fire horse driver. This name was soon shortened to fire chief. Another possibility is that the horse engine driver was called the \"fire chief\" because he, as an individual, was more important than all the other members of the company. He was in charge and responsible for the well-being of the engine and it's operation.<|endoftext|>by Moonta » Fri May 18, 2015 3:20 pm\n\nJust wanted to thank you guys for organising such a great night of racing at Moonta Speedway on Sunday.\n\n\n\nPitched up for my first race meeting with my newly acquired Nitro powered Stadium truck and was so stoked to win my first round race.\n\n\n\nWas great to see the car count at the track and wish the racing would continue, as I'm sure a number of others do.\n\n\n\nLooking forward to the next round in July.<|endoftext|>Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nPUPILS at a Stockton school are having lessons in boxing and taekwondo to try and reduce the amount of anti-social behaviour around the site.\n\nPupils at Marton Manor school, near the A174 in Billingham, are being taught boxing by a specialist police officer as part of the schools anti-gang programme.\n\nLast week, staff at the school, which has been identified as a hotspot for gang activity, were told about plans to send police officers into lessons.\n\nBut rather than scare pupils, staff say that boxing lessons and taekwondo, which was introduced in December, have given youngsters the chance to take part in healthy activities outside of the classroom.\n\nSchool co-ordinator of PE and sport, Tony Farrington, said: \"The police officers come to the school and give the children a quick boxing lesson.\n\n\"It takes about an hour but it is really worthwhile because the children really enjoy it.\n\n\"There are about eight pupils involved at the moment.

McHugh, the secretary of the Army, issued a list of seven things he felt were wrong with the service’s basic combat training.\n\nAt the top of the list was the idea that Basic Combat Training is far too long. The Army said it was conducting an extensive review of the entire process.\n\nThis week the Army, apparently satisfied with its analysis, decided to do nothing.\n\nThe basic training cycle will remain the same. The 17-week course will continue to include rifle marksmanship, unarmed combat and field training. The Army said that, as a result of its review, it found there was “no silver bullet.”\n\nThe Army conducted extensive testing and surveys to assess soldier and trainer performance. Officials said they were open to adjustments based on recommendations in the report, which is expected to be made public this summer.\n\nCommand Sgt. Maj. Marvin Hill, the senior noncommissioned officer in charge of the Army’s Comprehensive Soldier Fitness initiative, said the goal of the review was to improve soldier performance.\n\n“We are looking at the how,” he said. “The what and why are still relevant.”\n\nGen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, said the review indicated the system “works pretty well.”\n\n“But there are ways to make it better,” he said.\n\nWhile there is no talk about changing the basic combat training cycle, it is likely that some recommendations will be implemented to improve training in specific areas.\n\nSome of those could include addressing the issue of hazing, an area that the Army has been working on for years. A few months ago, an Army drill sergeant was convicted of hazing and sentenced to 10 months in prison.\n\nAnother recommendation that is likely to be adopted is a reduction in the number of rifle cleaning tasks a soldier must perform. Officials said that training rifle maintenance has been an issue for some time.\n\n“We think it is overtraining and we think we can pare it down,” said Col. Gary H. Jones, the commander of the Fort Jackson, S.C., training brigade.\n\nIt is likely that the Army will implement some of the findings from the study. It is not clear whether it will make changes to basic combat training as a result of the Army’s review.\n\n“What we are doing is reviewing the study,” said Lt. Col. Terry B. Leonard, a spokesman for the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command. “When the review is complete, we will discuss with senior leaders and make recommendations on how to improve the system.”\n\nOfficials said that the Army is always looking for ways to improve training.\n\n“You have to ask yourself,” said Mr. Hill, “‘Is this as good as it can be?’”\n\nThe study was led by Lt. Gen. David Huntoon Jr., who had been the commander of the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, and by Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the vice chief of staff of the Army.\n\nThe Army’s Training and Doctrine Command was disbanded a few years ago, but Gen. Casey said that"

Mayweather is widely considered one of the best fighters of his generation and, if he chooses to hang up the gloves, it will be the end of a perfect run.\n\nThere is no doubt that Mayweather has cemented his legacy with this run, but we have seen the perfect run come to an end in the past. Oscar De La Hoya comes to mind. The now retired boxer had a perfect run of his own.\n\nWhile De La Hoya lost a few of his middleweight fights, he got back on track with a string of victories at welterweight and lightweight. De La Hoya then ran through every fighter in his way to win two world titles at light middleweight. He then went on to dominate another series of fighters. He knocked out Felix Trinidad in 2001. That fight was the best example of Oscar’s career because he faced a much bigger opponent.\n\nTrinidad weighed in a little bit over 170 pounds while De La Hoya was right at 154 pounds. Even though Trinidad was bigger, De La Hoya did not worry. The Mexican boxer used his speed and technique to win a unanimous decision. Trinidad was never the same after the fight.\n\nThen De La Hoya won the welterweight title by defeating Shane Mosley by unanimous decision. Mosley was at his peak and people were excited for the possibility of the rematch. De La Hoya also fought and defeated Miguel Cotto. Cotto was another guy who did not want to give De La Hoya credit, but the boxing world understood who won that fight.\n\nDe La Hoya had several great performances in 2002. The boxer beat Felix Sturm and former super middleweight champion Roy Jones Jr. Oscar also beat Arturo Gatti. Gatti was a great fighter who never received the recognition he deserved.\n\nThen came 2003 and De La Hoya was dominating like no other. He faced Shane Mosley again and looked incredible in the fight. De La Hoya took some shots, but got out of the way and won a unanimous decision. Oscar then stopped Zab Judah in a very exciting fight. De La Hoya also won against Ike Quartey.\n\nThat was the end of De La Hoya’s perfect run. It was the peak of his career. After that, he just started to decline. He fought Felix Sturm again and lost a decision. He had one more good fight against Antonio Margarito, but then he got knocked out by Bernard Hopkins. He lost that fight in the 9th round.\n\nDe La Hoya also lost his following fight against Shane Mosley in 2007. De La Hoya also lost his next fight against Manny Pacquiao. That fight showed a huge decline in De La Hoya’s boxing skills. De La Hoya would never fight again.\n\nPeople also point to the rise of Manny Pacquiao as a sign of De La Hoya’s decline. While that is true, the decline did not start in the Pacquiao fight. In that fight, De La Hoya just got stopped. After that fight, De La Hoya would only win once in his final five fights. De La Hoya was a shell of his former self. He was never able to recover from his decline.\n\nPacquiao would go on to dominate the next few years of boxing. Mayweather also started to dominate the division. In that sense, De La Hoya was unlucky to face Pacquiao and Mayweather during their best years. That was not his fault.\n\nWhile Pacquiao and Mayweather are fighters with big personalities and huge followings, De La Hoya was a fighter who dominated the boxing world in his prime. It is unfortunate that he got into boxing too late to make the most of his talent.<|endoftext|>5e MEI 1944\n\n4e Gevecht van Rommels strijdmacht met de 101e.

"a condensed guide to remove the duplication in an original table of contents in a book\n\nTo add a further level of duplication, the table of contents will be extracted from a book that has one in order to create a second one, then combined with the first to create a third.\n\nMy sister, Linda, and I have spent the last ten years extracting tables of contents from books and magazines, and a few other items.\n\nAs with so many things in my life, it all started because I was looking for something and I found something else instead.\n\nThe first time I extracted a table of contents from a book, it was for a university assignment. I had been studying French history, and was given a very large book on the French Revolution. The book had a number of useful appendices, but I was most interested in the one titled, A Chronology of the French Revolution.\n\nThere was only one problem. The appendix was part of a larger volume and it was far too heavy to carry around and read on the bus or the train to and from class. I needed a copy of the appendix that I could take with me. But how?\n\nIt was simple. A few photocopies later and I was able to use the book to guide me through a history I was only just starting to understand.\n\nA couple of years later, I was given a copy of The Guinness Book of Records. It was a gift for my 10th birthday. I wasn’t even sure what it was when I unwrapped it. But, boy, was I glad I had it a few weeks later when my best friend came over to visit.\n\n“You gotta come see this!” he said, “I think it’s the best book ever.”\n\nHe showed me the page with the longest words and longest numbers. It didn’t seem like much of a competition to me. But I had just found the best way to impress my friends, especially if it involved big numbers or big words.\n\nFrom that point on, I spent a lot of time with the Guinness Book. It was a fascinating book to a ten-year-old. My sister had told me I had to read it before I could look at the television. It had pictures of all the characters in Star Wars. It also had a comprehensive section on how to make a nuclear bomb.\n\nEventually, I discovered an interesting thing. I was the only kid I knew that could take any television commercial and cut it down to its most important phrases. “Buy, buy, buy!”, “More, more, more!” and “Who needs the phone when I can just drive my car into the supermarket and buy what I want from the grocery store!”\n\nI’d only seen the commercials a couple of times, but I had an amazing memory for what they said.\n\nFrom this point on, I wanted to understand the commercials. I wanted to understand the words and phrases they used. I had a new goal in life. It was time to study linguistics.\n\nBut, first, I had to get a degree in something else.\n\nI was studying film. I was taking a lot of English and Linguistics courses. I spent hours in the library researching movie scripts, and other people’s attempts at a good story. I studied story, scene, and character structure. I read a lot of books.\n\nThen I decided I wanted to write a story.\n\nI read the books and the screenplays. I took notes. I scribbled ideas.\n\nThen I began to outline a story.\n\nI had a good beginning. I had an ending. But I didn’t have a middle. And it was going to be a very long story. I needed something to fill in the time in between.\n\nBut what?\n\nI could’ve made something up. But, after all those writing courses, I knew that my imagination didn’t have the skill or the expertise to pull it off. And what if someone else used the same ideas? It could be my story, but it wouldn’t be my idea.\n\nThe other option was to take an idea from something I had already read. I was into comics. I read a lot of them. I’d see comic strips in newspapers and wonder if they could be anything other than one or two frames long.\n\nThen it occurred to me that I’d already seen the main character in my own life.\n\nThe main character in my story was going to be someone who was very different from me. He was going to be Jewish. He was going to be short and fat. And he was going to have trouble with the opposite sex.\n\nI found him in Archie Comics. I loved the comics. I used to buy them by the armful. I knew a lot about Archie and Betty and Veronica. I knew everything about them.\n\nBut what I really wanted to know was about the rest of the family. So, I did a little research and discovered that I had enough information to create a backstory for them. I took a few of the comic strips I had written and rearranged them to create a single sequence. I didn’t like the idea of rearranging things. I didn’t like it because I liked the original version.\n\nSo I decided to turn it into a comic strip. I photocopied the panels and filled in the words. I had created a complete story. It was kind of a comic strip, but it was also a story. It wasn’t long. It was about 10 pages long. It had a beginning, a middle, and an ending. It was a complete story.\n\nI showed it to my friends and they loved it.\n\nThey loved it so much, that I created a couple of more stories like it. I started to create characters and tell stories about them. And I wrote a comic strip that had a beginning, a middle, and an ending.\n\nI had created a mini-series.\n\nI kept doing this for years.\n\nEventually, I became an editor for a couple of comic strips.\n\nI was also working on a lot of magazine articles. And I had a new job at the campus newspaper. I also had the chance to go to a lot of concerts and I had started to take pictures at them. I began to write reviews of the shows I went to.\n\nIt was at one of these concerts that I met the woman who would eventually become my wife.\n\nAfter the show, we chatted for a while and I gave her my card. She called and asked me to work with her on a magazine project she was working on. I did the artwork for it and she wrote the story.\n\nI moved to Los Angeles.\n\nA couple of years later, we had a child.\n\nShe was a precocious child and she got bored easily.\n\nShe loved puzzles and she loved books.\n\nShe also loved the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nI used to read it to her.\n\nShe loved stories.\n\nShe loved them so much that I started to write her stories. I created a character for her. I called him Grandpa. He was short and fat and he had trouble with the opposite sex.\n\nI wrote a few stories about him. I filled in the details and the gaps. I wrote them like a comic strip. I put in the panels. I filled them with text.\n\nShe liked them.\n\nWe’d sit and read them together. She’d follow along and point at each new panel. She liked the drawings. She liked the story.\n\nBut she wanted more.\n\nShe wanted me to make them into books.\n\nShe wanted me to illustrate them.\n\nSo, I did.\n\nI had a lot of experience in writing comics. And I had just finished a writing project for a friend. So, I started to create some illustrations for the story.\n\nIt took a couple of years, but I did it.\n\nI had created a series of books.\n\nI had also learned something else.\n\nI was also creating a series of books.\n\nSo, what was the difference?\n\nI looked at a lot of comic books and magazine articles. I read a lot of them. I read a lot of magazines and books and I looked at a lot of things that had both pictures and text. And I started to see a pattern.\n\nI also started to see a duplication in things.\n\nFor example, you have a magazine article. It has some text and it has some pictures. There’s a story and the story is told in words. And there are pictures that illustrate the story. The pictures have captions. They explain what the picture is about.\n\nYou then take the article and make it into a book. But what you do is very simple. You take the magazine article and you put it into a book. You add a few words and you put it in a book format.\n\nWhat you’ve really done is to duplicate the magazine article into a book.\n\nYou’ve added words.\n\nYou’ve added the book format.\n\nYou’ve added a cover.\n\nYou’ve added a binding.\n\nYou’ve added a page count.\n\nBut you’ve only changed the way it looks and not what it is.\n\nYou haven’t changed the story.\n\nYou haven’t changed the words.\n\nYou haven’t changed the pictures.\n\nSo, what is"
"What to do if you are feeling isolated\n\nSocial isolation is when a person experiences social withdrawal and/or decreased contact with family, friends or people in the community. This is often experienced by older people, but is becoming an increasing problem for people of all ages.\n\nSocial isolation can impact on a person's physical and emotional health, and can negatively impact a person's sense of wellbeing. It can also lead to social isolation to be more likely for older people, and can reduce their life expectancy.\n\nSocial isolation can be caused by a number of factors, such as:\n\nReduced mobility - Older people often rely on transport to connect with other people. As mobility declines it can become difficult to travel to a community group or attend social functions\n\nSocial stigma - There can be social stigma associated with people with disabilities and/or health conditions\n\nBarriers to employment - The costs of transport, accommodation and child care can increase the barriers to employment for people who have disabilities\n\nLoneliness - Older people can experience loneliness when they are isolated from their families and friends.\n\nIf you feel that you are experiencing social isolation, there are some steps that you can take to address the issue.<|endoftext|>Quote:\n\nSeeker of the Question Originally Posted by\n\nHere's my thoughts on the 5D2 video feature.\n\n\n\nIt's pretty good, but I don't see it as a huge improvement over the 5DmkII in that regard. If you don't do any shooting in low light, there's nothing this camera can do that the 5DmkII can't do just as well or better.\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that the video feature was primarily introduced to help sell the camera in Asian markets where people are using it as a primary camera, and it gives the 5D2 a much-needed leg up in that market. But in the west, it's been largely ignored by users of the 5DII, and I think it's likely to continue that way.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons I think this. First and foremost, the Canon DSLRs that were meant to replace the 5DmkII are the 7D and 60D. Both of these cameras are superb cameras for video, and even more affordable than the 5D2. As such, I don't see why anyone would buy a 5D2 unless they just wanted a full-frame camera and didn't want to spend more for the 7D or 60D.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the 5D2's video mode doesn't offer a lot of advantages over its predecessors that justify paying the extra price of a 5D2. The only two things I can think of are the dual DIGIC IV processors, which don't really have much of an impact in video mode, and the noise reduction in video mode, which is a good thing but probably not enough to make most people spend the extra cash on a 5D2 for.\n\n\n\nThirdly, the camera has major draw backs that don't exist on the 7D or 60D. One is the time it takes to turn on the camera and start recording. The other is that it uses a much slower frame rate than the 7D and 60D, and only allows it to record a maximum of 29 minutes of video on one card. The 60D allows recording for an hour and a half on a 16GB card.\n\n\n\nThose reasons combined with the fact that the 5D2's video mode doesn't do anything that a 7D or 60D can't do just as well or better, I think that it's going to get used very little, and people will be buying these primarily as still cameras and occasional video cameras.<|endoftext|>After running out of Kept, I'm trying a different product.

However, this is not a Blu-Ray Disc but a regular DVD.)\n\nPicture: The picture is not 16:9 enhanced and is a ratio of 1.33:1. The picture quality varies, but it is decent. However, there are many scenes where the picture is dark, blurred, and has an odd light-shadow pattern. It's not always so noticeable, but it's definitely there. It's actually worse than the first DVD release of season 1. Audio: Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0. It is 2-channel stereo, which is good for TV shows. However, there are several episodes that have a monotonous, low, and slow background sound. This is a downer for me. However, dialogue and music sound fine.\n\nExtras: Unfortunately, there are no extras for this DVD.<|endoftext|>Next up in my Indie Haul of 2016, I have a sweet card game, Set.\n\nNow, I am not a big fan of card games. They are, for the most part, luck-based, and I am pretty boring, so unless I am playing something that has a lot of theme or interesting gameplay, I don’t find them very interesting. That is why this game was interesting to me. This is one of those games that the more I learn about it, the more interesting it gets. And to be fair, it isn’t really a game where luck is a major component.\n\nFirst, a bit about the gameplay. Set is a card game about finding sets of three cards. These sets come in four forms:\n\nOne of the four base shapes\n\nOne of the four colors\n\nOne of the four words\n\nTwo of the four different attributes (circle, triangle, square, cross)\n\nThe card comes in different colors, shapes, and symbols, but on each card, one attribute is in the foreground and two are in the background. This is a key element of the gameplay. It means that not only are you trying to find sets, but you have to sort through the cards to find the ones that match your sets, and there is only a single card that matches your sets.\n\nEach player starts the game with a hand of twelve cards, and three cards are dealt to the center of the table. Each player gets to see the three cards in the center, and these cards can be used as a part of your sets. You have to be careful here, because if you use one of the three cards from the center, you won’t get to keep it, and once all three have been used, they are replaced with three new cards. Each turn, you can pick up one card from the center or you can take the first card from your hand and play it in a set. You are never required to play a card from your hand, but once you pick up a card from the center, you can’t play a card from your hand. It is entirely possible to keep your first card and end your turn, which is an interesting element of the gameplay.\n\nOnce you have three cards in a set, you put them face-down in front of you. After that, you pick up the card you played and add it to your hand, then replace the center card with a new card. You continue until one player finds three sets, and that player wins the game.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is relatively simple and straightforward. I found it interesting that once you add the deck, the actual number of possible combinations goes way up. The game is deceptively easy, but the challenge is in finding the cards that you need.\n\nNow, one of the elements of this game that I was most impressed with is the artwork. The artwork is absolutely phenomenal, and there is a ton of it. I have no idea how much art this game has, but it is a lot. There are 64 cards in the game, and there is a ton of artwork on each card, with every card having four separate parts. The only issue that I had with the artwork is the text. It is a very small typeface and sometimes difficult to read. That, in addition to the fact that a lot of the cards have similar artwork, means that you need to look at a card before you play it to ensure that you have the card that you need. It is pretty easy to tell the difference between the cards once you know what you are looking for, but I still found myself second-guessing myself on some of the sets.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty cool game. I was initially surprised by the game, but it was easy to pick up and learn how to play. The artwork is absolutely stunning, but the only issue that I had with it was the small typeface. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys card games and is looking for something different. I’m not sure that I would play this game again, but it was definitely worth the $15 I spent on it.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>Corrosion Attack: DiPietro (2010) has reported on a severe attack of corrosion in water-cooled nuclear reactors where a very high amount of nickel is present in the coolant.

"Carlisle United F.C.\n\nCarlisle United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Carlisle, Cumbria, where they play at Brunton Park, in the city of Carlisle. The club currently competes in League Two, the fourth tier of the English league system. Formed in 1904, they have played at their current home ground, Brunton Park, since 1912. They play in blue and white vertically striped shirts, black shorts and socks. Their best performance in the League Cup came in the 1987–88 season when they reached the quarter-finals.\n\nThe club's main rivals are Morecambe, where their match is known as the West Cumbrian derby, and Barrow, against whom they contest the Barrow-Carlisle derby. Carlisle's highest achievement in cup competitions came in the 1913 FA Cup, where they reached the semi-finals, and finished runners-up.\n\nIn 2011, they were relegated from the Football League, and are currently in the National League, the fifth tier of the English league system. This is the club's second relegation in successive seasons and the fourth time they have been relegated from the Football League.\n\nThe club was formed on 17 May 1904 at Shaddongate United's annual general meeting where the club's members voted to change the team's name to Carlisle United. All words and titles were retained with the exception of 'United', which was shortened to 'Carlisle'. Carlisle United's first game was a friendly match on 5 September 1904 at home against Hull City which ended in a 2–2 draw. The first competitive game was an FA Cup preliminary round replay against York City, which ended 3–0 in favour of Carlisle.\n\nThis first season saw Carlisle play friendlies against Millwall, Sheffield United and Manchester United. In 1905, Carlisle United won their first trophy, the West Cumbria League and the Carlisle Border League, and were crowned champions of the West Cumbria League for the second consecutive season. They finished as runners-up in the West Cumbria League and moved on to the Carlisle & District League which they won in the 1907–08 season. They won the Border League and the Carlisle & District League in the 1908–09 season, before going on to win the West Cumbria League again in the 1909–10 season. After regularly finishing in their previous seasons, their first silverware came in the 1913 FA Cup. Carlisle beat Fulham 5–2 in the final at Old Trafford, to win the competition for the first and only time. They were also champions of the Border League and the Carlisle & District League in the 1913–14 season, but failed to win any competition in 1914–15.\n\nIn the second World War, Carlisle competed in the Northern League, suspended for seven seasons between 1939 and 1946. When the war finished, the club returned to the Northern League for the 1946–47 season. Carlisle achieved their highest position in the English football league pyramid when they came eighth in the 1950–51 season. In the 1953–54 season, Carlisle played in one of the first floodlit friendlies, against Everton.\n\nThe club was nicknamed \"The Reds\" in the 1960s due to the colour of their kit and their fans' similar devotion. Carlisle's greatest achievement in cup competitions until recent times was in reaching the semi-finals of the 1964–65 FA Cup. The club had little success in league competition until they finished as runners-up in the Third Division in 1989–90, gaining promotion to the Second Division. In 1993–94, Carlisle reached the play-offs for promotion to the new FA Premier League, but lost out to Bolton Wanderers. They reached the play-offs for promotion again in 1995–96, and came close to promotion to the Premier League in 1997–98, but finished six points behind second placed Leyton Orient.\n\nIn June 2009, United secured promotion to the Football League for the first time since 1997, beating Grimsby Town at Wembley Stadium 1–0. They spent two seasons in League One, and their first season in the third tier of English football ended in them being crowned champions of League Two and being promoted to League One. However, their second season back in League One ended with a 21st-place finish, resulting in relegation back to League Two.\n\nIn their first season in League Two, they finished fifth, qualifying for the play-offs where they lost to Bradford City in the semi-finals. They won promotion to League One as champions of League Two, with a 1–0 win against Burton Albion in the 2016 League Two play-off final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nThe club played in the Northern League before joining the Midland League, in an amateur league set up by the Football League to try to establish a professional league below The Football League. This meant that Carlisle played first in the Midland League and then the Northern League. The 1902–03 season saw the club win both the Midland League and the Northern League, to take the double of the league titles.\n\nIn 1909, the club applied to join the Football League, but was turned down. However, the club joined the Second Division of the Lancashire Combination, which they won in their first season, and were promoted to the First Division. In 1911, the club became a limited company, and in 1912 moved to their current ground, Brunton Park. They were admitted into the North Eastern League. The club remained in the league until the First World War began. In 1921, the league was reduced from two divisions to one, and Carlisle played in the North Eastern League, winning the league title in the 1924–25 season. They then joined the Scottish League Division Two, and remained in that division for two seasons.\n\nIn 1928, they were admitted into the English Third Division North. In the 1928–29 season, the club reached the second round of the FA Cup for the first time, beating York City and Darlington before losing 3–2 in the fourth round to Manchester United at Old Trafford. They also reached the second round of the FA Cup the following season, beating Gateshead and Stockport County before losing 1–0 at home to Portsmouth.\n\nIn 1930, Carlisle left the Third Division North, becoming one of the founding members of the Third Division. In their first season, they finished last in the league and were relegated. They won their first game of the season 1–0 against Rochdale, and their last game 3–1 against Wrexham. In 1932, the club was promoted back to the Second Division after finishing as runners-up in the Third Division North. They remained in the Second Division until the league was suspended due to the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1947, they were placed in the Third Division (North), but were relegated at the end of the season. They were promoted to the Second Division in 1953, and then promoted to the First Division in 1959, when they finished as runners-up in the Second Division. They were relegated at the end of the 1959–60 season, but were promoted back to the First Division in 1962 after finishing as runners-up in the Second Division. They remained in the First Division until 1966, when they were relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st in the league. They were relegated to the Third Division in 1970.\n\nCarlisle won the Third Division in 1972, and were promoted to the Second Division. The club spent two seasons in the Second Division, before they were relegated back to the Third Division at the end of the 1974–75 season. The club reached the third round of the FA Cup in 1978–79, beating Chesterfield, Doncaster Rovers, Aldershot, Swansea City and Leeds United before losing to Arsenal in the third round. They spent the first half of the 1980s in the Third Division, winning the League Cup in 1986, beating Sunderland in the final at Wembley.\n\nIn 1987–88, the club won the Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division for the first time in 28 years. They were relegated at the end of their first season in the First Division.\n\nAfter one season in the Second Division, the club returned to the First Division after finishing as runners-up in the Second Division. The club then spent the 1990s in the top flight of English football, peaking in the 1993–94 season, when they reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, beating Notts County, Middlesbrough, Coventry City, Sheffield Wednesday and West Ham United, and qualified for the UEFA Cup, the first time the club had competed in European competition. They were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 1995–96 season, but were promoted back to the Premier League in 1997–98, although they were relegated again after just one season.\n\nCarlisle were relegated to the Second Division after finishing bottom of the Premier League at the end of the 1999–2000 season. They reached the final of the Football League Trophy, after beating Northampton Town, Port Vale, Walsall, Millwall, Shrewsbury Town and Tranmere Rovers, but lost 2–0 to Grimsby Town in the final. In the following season, they were relegated to the Third Division. In 2001–02, the club were relegated again, this time to the Football Conference.\n\nIn 2002–03, the club won the Football Conference, regaining their place in the Football League, and also reached the final of the Football League Trophy, but lost 2–1 to Brentford. The club remained in League One until 2007–08, when they finished as runners-up and were promoted to the Championship, the second tier of English football. The following season, they finished 19th in the league, and were relegated back to League One. In the same season, they won the Football League"
"Spare Time Cribbage Rules\n\nHow to Play Cribbage\n\n\n\nLearn Cribbage rules\n\nThe most popular variation of the Cribbage game is the two player version.\n\nPlayers sit opposite each other and play two games. A typical cribbage game is 12 to 18 hands.\n\nEach player is dealt six cards in batches of three.\n\n\n\nThe Cribbage Board\n\nCards are played to the board by counting the number of points to be scored for a specific card. The numbers are marked on the board by the numbers 1 to 15 in ascending order.\n\nThere is an arrow, called the \"point,\" above the number 15. This arrow can be slid along the board to point at the score that needs to be scored.\n\nThe board has two vertical lines, each with two smaller lines:\n\nThe line on the left is used to keep track of the running total of the score.\n\nThe line on the right is used to keep track of the total number of points scored.\n\n\n\nScoring\n\n\n\nThe aim of the game is to reach 121 points.\n\nThe score of a card can be obtained by counting the pips on the card. The pips are counted on both sides of the card. The picture of the card is also counted as a pip.\n\nEach card score has a point value, from 2 points for a two, up to 15 points for a king, queen or jack. The king, queen and jack are each worth a score of five points.\n\nAces are worth 1 point, the rest of the cards are worth their pips.\n\nFor example, a 7 card is worth seven points, the two of clubs is worth two points, and the three of clubs is worth three points.\n\nThe total of a hand is always the total of the cards, plus the point value of any cards that are played to the board.\n\n\n\nThe Deal\n\nThe dealer is decided randomly.\n\nThe non-dealer shuffles the deck of cards.\n\nThe dealer deals six cards to each player in batches of three.\n\nThe remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table. This pile of cards is called the \"stock.\"\n\nThe top card from the stock is turned over and placed on the top of the stock. This card is called the \"upcard.\"\n\nAt the start of the game, the two players take turns to play cards to the board, in turn.\n\n\n\nIn Cribbage, it is possible to \"cut the pack\" when the stock is depleted.\n\nCutting the pack means the player cuts the pack into two. The player cuts the stock at any point between the upcard and the bottom card in the pack.\n\nWhen cutting the pack, the player does not shuffle the cards after the cut, but rather the two halves are placed in the two player's hands.\n\nAfter a cut, play continues in a similar manner to the usual method of dealing and playing cards.\n\nA player who cuts the pack at the start of the game, is also the dealer for the second game.\n\nPlayers who have played with a standard pack of cards will probably notice that the order of the cards is slightly different from the usual order. This is because the pack is cut differently, and because the upcard is placed on the top of the stock at the start of the game.\n\nWhen one player plays all his cards, the game is over.\n\nThe score can be calculated and the player with the highest score is the winner.\n\n\n\nGame End\n\nWhen both players have exhausted their hands, the player with the lowest total points is the winner.\n\nIn case of a tie, the winner is the player who has made more pairs.\n\nIf there is still a tie, then the player with more runs is the winner.\n\nIf there is still a tie, the game is a tie.\n\n\n\nCribbage Rules\n\nThere are a number of other scoring combinations in the Cribbage game, in addition to the pairs and runs.\n\nThey are explained on the Cribbage Rules page.\n\nThe object of Cribbage is to be the first player to reach 121 points, or more points than the opponent.\n\nPlayers who are more familiar with standard playing cards may find it easier to learn to count Cribbage points from the point values on the standard playing card pips.\n\n\n\nCribbage game variations\n\nSome people play the game using the \"five up\" rule. This means the first card that is laid out on the table scores five points, not four.\n\nMany people, however, prefer to use the \"two up\" rule. This means the first card that is laid out on the table scores two points, not four.\n\nSome people play the game in a similar manner to the two up rule, but only score two points for an ace.\n\nOther people play the game in a similar manner to the two up rule, but score six points for an ace.\n\nThere are also a number of other variations of Cribbage rules.\n\nThere is a popular alternative to the traditional Cribbage board.\n\nThe alternative board uses the same numbered cards to form a playing card.\n\nA traditional Cribbage board uses an arrow to show the score, whereas the alternative board uses the same numbered card as the score.\n\nAn alternative board is shown at the bottom of this page.\n\nThe alternative board is simply laid out with no arrow.\n\nSome people prefer this alternative to the traditional cribbage board, as it has less clutter and easier to keep track of the score.\n\nThe rules are the same for the traditional cribbage board and the alternative board.\n\nThe alternative board does, however, make it a little harder to keep track of the total points scored.\n\nSpare Time Cribbage\n\nSpare Time Cribbage is a single deck Cribbage variation.\n\nThis game is played on a traditional cribbage board, and is sometimes called \"Crib.\"\n\nA standard pack of 52 cards is used.\n\nThe game is played in two \"spare time\" games. The first game is 12 hands long.\n\nThe second game is 10 hands long.\n\nThe loser of the first game is the first player to play the first hand in the second game.\n\n\n\nAces and 2s are worth 1 point, all other cards are worth their face value.\n\nThe game is played in three turns. Each player plays two cards to the board in each turn.\n\nAfter each player has played two cards, the player with the lowest card scores two points. This continues until both players have played all their cards.\n\nThe first game is played to a total of 61 points.\n\nThe winner of the first game is the first player to score 61 points.\n\nThe loser of the first game scores nothing.\n\nIf the loser of the first game reaches 61 points, the winner of the first game scores nothing.\n\nIn the second game, the winner of the first game scores 2 points.\n\nThe loser of the first game scores nothing.\n\nThe second game is played to a total of 41 points.\n\nThe first player to reach 41 points, or more, is the winner.\n\nIf both players reach 41 points, the winner is the player with the most points.\n\nIf there is a tie, the first player to reach 61 points, or more, is the winner.\n\nThe winner of the second game scores 2 points.\n\nThe loser of the second game scores nothing.\n\n\n\nWe are always looking for variations and improvements to Cribbage rules.\n\nIf you know of an alternative method of playing Cribbage,\n\nor if you have a suggestion for an improvement to the Cribbage rules,\n\nplease let us know.\n\n\n\nVisit our Cribbage Rules page\n\nThere is also a page about counting cribbage points and keeping track of cribbage scores.\n\n\n\nThere is a page that describes the origins of Cribbage.\n\n\n\nSome people who like Cribbage also enjoy playing Euchre.\n\nThere is a description of Euchre rules and variations.\n\n\n\nSome people also enjoy playing Gin Rummy.\n\nThere is a description of Gin Rummy rules and variations.\n\n\n\nVisit our Online Dice game to play dice games online.\n\nThere is a page with tips for playing the dice game and strategies for playing dice.\n\nThere is also a page that describes the origins of the dice game.\n\n\n\nCopyright | Privacy Policy | Disclaimer | Contact | Copyright Notice\n\n\n\n© 2005-2019 http://www.SpareTimeGames.com\n\nAll Rights Reserved<|endoftext|>(CNN) As Theresa May was moving into Downing Street on Wednesday, a new bridge was opening across the river Severn.\n\nThe Britannia Bridge -- that uninspiring name chosen to reflect the post-Brexit aim of forging close ties with the Commonwealth -- cost £100 million, but it's meant to save drivers hours of frustration by providing a faster route between north and south Wales.\n\nThere's been a crossing here since 1763, when the current bridge was built -- the first to cross the Severn estuary -- and its opening was described in a contemporary report as an occasion of \"the utmost consequence to the public.\"\n\nThis week, the new crossing was hailed by the first minister of Wales as a symbol of the strength of the union.

In an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of MKULTRA, let us turn our attention to another figure who made an impact on psychedelic culture, and who also worked as a CIA consultant.\n\nIn 1957 the American author and academic, Aldous Huxley, published The Doors of Perception. The book was to have a profound impact on the counter-culture movement of the 1960s. The book described Huxley’s experiences when experimenting with mescaline, a drug derived from the peyote cactus, which Huxley took under the guidance of his friend, Humphry Osmond. It is clear that the book had a huge impact on figures such as Leary and Timothy O’Leary, an early collaborator of Leary’s. The book is known as a landmark work in the psychedelic subculture, and is the source of the famous quote “The Doors of Perception are opened,” by which many a young hippy gained access to the expanded universe of psychedelia. However, what is less known is that Huxley was a CIA consultant. In fact, Huxley had been connected with the CIA almost from the moment he had arrived in the United States. He was part of the interlocking directorate that we have seen linked to the CIA’s MKULTRA program.\n\nIn the second part of a three part series, we will discuss Huxley’s background and what led him to work with the CIA. We will see that he was connected to figures from the American establishment that ran parallel with the CIA and the MKULTRA program. We will also look at his personal connection to the drug LSD, which he advocated as a powerful tool for mind expansion. We will see how his advocacy of the drug LSD served to bring LSD to the attention of Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert.\n\nDynastic Connections\n\nAldous Huxley was born on July 26, 1894 at 11 Lavington Street, in Hampstead, London. Huxley’s grandfather, Thomas Henry Huxley, was an English biologist and a proponent of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. Huxley was related to prominent members of the British establishment and had connections with prominent figures in British politics. For instance, the British poet, Alfred Lord Tennyson was a first cousin of his mother. Aldous’ mother, Julia Arnold, was the daughter of the highly influential British novelist, Mary Augusta Ward. Julia’s father was Richard, son of Sir Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby School, and of a family well connected to the British establishment.\n\nThe Arnold family was connected to Sir Matthew Arnold, the British poet, essayist, and cultural critic. Arnold was an important member of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. He had a significant influence on the Victorian Age and was a friend of the famous British poet, Alfred Tennyson. Sir Matthew was the poet laureate between 1848 and 1869.\n\nJulia’s mother was a follower of the Austrian philosopher, Rudolf Steiner. Rudolf Steiner, born in 1861, was a key figure in the European Theosophical movement, which focused on the spiritual development of the individual. It has been alleged that Steiner was an agent for the German secret service, which would not be surprising given that many other members of Theosophy were in fact spies. A secret society within Theosophy, known as the OTO, which has connections to Western esotericism and German fascism, has been allegedly linked to the CIA. Rudolf Steiner was involved with the OTO. The following excerpt from a Russian government website describes Steiner’s role:\n\n“Rudolf Steiner’s Theosophical activities were closely connected to the “Armenia” Lodge (Br. 310) of the “Ordo Templi Orientis” (OTO), founded in 1910. This Masonic lodge was founded by the Austrian Theosophist Carl Kellner (1851-1905), the head of the lodge from 1902. A regular visitor to the lodge was the German occultist and scientist Theodor Reuss (1855-1923), the head of the OTO from 1922. Reuss, an alchemist, was a follower of Carl Kellner’s.\n\nThe members of the “Armenia” Lodge of the OTO played a prominent role in the life of Rudolf Steiner. They were able to draw on the resources of the Thule Society, which was funded by German industrialists such as Thyssen, Krupp and the Stinnes family.\n\nAt the same time, the theosophical society was run by the “General Anthroposophical Society,” founded in 1912. The members of this society, which also included politicians such as Brüning, Papen and Schwerin von Krosigk, financed the publication of the society’s journal, “anonymous”. Rudolf Steiner was supported by wealthy bourgeois benefactors such as Olga and Alfons Paquet, by “Eva” Rosenstandt (also a member of the OTO), as well as by the publisher Ernst Schering.\n\nSteiner was also supported by the German military and political elite. This support had been decisive in his appointment as honorary professor at the University of Berlin in 1916. Steiner was involved in a scandal at this time. A member of the Berlin University committee had brought accusations against Steiner of forgery and a breach of trust, and was eventually forced to resign. The result was that Steiner retained his professorship. The German writer Ernst von Wolzogen, whose second wife was a member of the “Armenia” Lodge of the OTO, arranged for Steiner to give a series of lectures at the “Mensa Isiaca” Lodge in Berlin. The men’s club was headed by Prince Philip von Hessen, a member of the German branch of the British royal family. Among the members were Kurt von Krockow, Werner Schmiedel, Ludwig Klages and Oskar Hopfer, all close to the Thule Society.\n\nSteiner was also supported by the Dutch-German industrialist Friedrich Rittelhaus, a follower of Guido von List. The Rittelhaus family owned large amounts of stock in the German industrial conglomerate, Hoechst. Rudolf Steiner and his assistants made frequent use of the extensive Hoechst archive. The Hoechst family, who lived at Castle Solitude, were the most prominent supporters of Steiner’s anthroposophy.\n\nIn 1916, during the First World War, a German naval officer and the secretary of the German Embassy in London, Karl Haushofer, came into contact with Theosophy. Haushofer founded the “Fraternitas Saturni,” an occult order which came under the control of the OTO in the 1930s. Haushofer, a friend of Haushofers and a guest at Castle Solitude, founded an important esoteric school in Munich in the 1920s, the “Rosenkreuzer”. This was run by Friedrich Gerber, a follower of Guido von List. Among the members were Adolf von Harnack, Erich Ludendorff, Hans Hirschfeld and Ernst Hellinger, as well as Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the German Military Intelligence Service and a member of the resistance against Hitler. Hellinger was involved in a secret association of the military which was a front for the secret service. Among the members of the group were Haushofer, Canaris, Himmler, Hans von Dohnanyi and Admiral Wilhelm Canaris.\n\nIn 1919, Adolf Hitler, who had just joined the German Workers Party, received his first occult training from Karl Haushofer.

"Eigenen Berechnungen zufolge haben die G 20 im vergangenen Jahr in Russland \"überhaupt keine Steuern gezahlt\" - so der Vorwurf des stellvertretenden Vorsitzenden der liberalen Oppositionspartei Jabloko, Maxim Katz, der die Regierung von Präsident Wladimir Putin am Mittwoch in Moskau ins Gebet nahm.\n\n\"Der einzige Sinn des G 20-Gipfels ist, den Zugang zum Kapitalmarkt zu sichern und das Geld des Steuerzahlers zu verteilen\", sagte der Politiker, der vor zwei Jahren als Russlands wohlhabendster Politiker galt.\n\nDie Kritik richtete sich gegen die geplante Finanzierung des Moskauer Gipfels der G 20 am 15. September. Die Regierung will mit einer Versteigerung der Häuser und Wohnungen sowie Ländereien des Eigentümers der Nationalbank von Russland rund 26 Millionen Euro erzielen, die sie zur Finanzierung der Gipfeltreffen zur Verfügung stellt. Das Geld soll aber nicht der Regierung, sondern einer russischen Stiftung namens \"Sustainable Impact\" zukommen, die wiederum an die Unterstützung von Projekten des G 20-Gipfels gebunden sein soll.\n\nDie Umgehung der klassischen öffentlichen Haushaltsaufstellung gab Anlass für die Vorwürfe. Denn die zu versteigernden Immobilien sind Teil der Nationalbank von Russland, die direkt der russischen Regierung unterstellt ist. \"Das Geld fließt von der einen in die andere Tasche\", so Katz. Er gehe davon aus, dass die G 20 ihre Unterbringung auf Kosten des russischen Steuerzahlers finanzieren werden. \"Ich frage die Minister: Wo bleiben die Steuern der G 20 auf der Krim?\", fügte der Oppositionspolitiker hinzu.\n\nBeim G 20-Gipfel 2013 in St. Petersburg gab es noch keine besonderen Probleme bei der Finanzierung des Gipfels, weil die Rolle Russlands als Gastgeber noch nicht zu den anhaltenden Spannungen im Ukraine-Konflikt geführt hatte.\n\n\"Das G 20-Treffen wird auch in diesem Jahr auf den Kosten des Steuerzahlers stattfinden\", kritisierte der russische Regierungsgegner. Der Aufwand für den Gipfel werde enorm sein, weil die Regierung Wladimir Putin \"Wasserstoffbomben\" produzieren lassen will. Dabei geht es um gigantische Unterstützungs- und Gastronomieprojekte. \"Die Stadt Moskau wird eine Viertelmillion Dollar in das \"Meer des Glücks\" investieren, das ein Aquarium werden soll\", sagte Katz.\n\nMehr zum Thema\n\nZuletzt hatten die Vorwürfe immerhin dazu geführt, dass der Gipfel erstmals im russischen Internet-Portal Rospotrebnadzor.ru eingestellt wurde. Die Regierung hatte erklärt, das Geld der G 20 fließe zur Förderung der öffentlichen Haushalte.<|endoftext|>This item is sold by Aqard Direct and fulfilled by our delivery providers.\n\n- A separate shipping fee is applied for orders from this Third-Party Seller.\n\n- Vouchers are not applicable on this item.\n\n\n\nVisit the Help Center for more info.<|endoftext|>The Return of the Living Dead (1985)\n\n(USA)\n\n\n\nOne can only assume that people in the 80s weren’t stupid enough to let actual zombies run amok in their neighborhoods. Or else it would have happened. And it would have been a bigger deal than it is now. A few news stories, a late-night TV scare special, maybe a little outrage, but mostly people would get bored of the topic pretty quickly and move on. But no, the characters in this movie don’t have that luxury.\n\n\n\nThe film opens with a group of kids enjoying a day at the cemetery, presumably as a means to draw out a possible girlfriend/love interest of one of them. One boy brings a portable radio, and an odd transmission is heard coming from it. A moment later, a group of decomposing bodies are rising from the earth. The teens flee to a nearby gas station to use the phone, only to find that the proprietor has been shot by a police officer. They soon realize that there is a zombie outbreak in the area, and that they need to find somewhere safe to ride it out. But the police officers and news crew that are already on the scene won’t leave the gas station. So what’s a few dozen young people to do?\n\n\n\nThe effects in this film are pretty impressive for the era. It was actually one of the first films to use digital compositing for effect. Of course, that meant that they needed to have a steady hand for each frame, since they were limited to four or five exposures. There are some shaky shots, which are all the more noticeable for having been digitally composited. But for the most part, the effects are as good as one could expect, given the budgetary constraints.\n\n\n\nThe acting in this film is really what makes it so interesting. The actors deliver their lines in a pretty serious manner, with very few smiles or other attempts to lighten the mood. The film has a decent sense of humor to it, but it’s not a comedy. I suspect that this may have been part of an effort to avoid the wrath of the MPAA. In 1985, there was no PG-13 rating, but there was an R rating, and that could have really hurt a film’s box office performance. So I imagine that this film may have been forced to tone down some of its humor, if it had any to begin with.\n\n\n\nThis film is a definite success for any horror film, since it wasn’t produced by any of the major studios, and was instead released by TriStar. The film earned a number of Saturn Awards, including Best Horror Film, Best Direction, and Best Special Effects.\n\n\n\nBottom line: this film is a must-watch for any fan of horror films. It is a great film for parties, since it doesn’t take itself too seriously. And it’s short enough to make it a good double feature with any number of other 80s horror films.\n\n\n\nFun fact:\n\nAt the very end of the film, a group of soldiers in hazmat suits arrive at the gas station to take care of the problem. But that was clearly not the intended ending. The ending that was filmed was meant to show the creatures attacking the soldiers, and ending with the discovery that they were infected by the zombies. That ending was deemed to be too graphic for the time, and so the change was made. The cast even shot a second version of the scene, with more characters dressed as soldiers. And then it was discovered that the group was not actually allowed to shoot guns on location, and so the final scene as we see it was filmed. But you can see the director’s cut of the scene at the film’s website, or on the DVD as an extra.\n\n(review originally published on DVD Verdict)<|endoftext|>I have the link in your signature now.

"The Thelesparian Cabal was an organization founded in the Thelesparian Sea by Akusar, the Archmage of Water. His objective was to manipulate the course of history in favor of Thelesparians. The group had an iron-clad rule about their personal lives: they were not permitted to marry or have children. Instead, they were required to take other members into their fold in order to expand their power base. The cabal was destroyed when Zz'dtri stole their immortality spell and sacrificed himself to destroy it.\n\nContents show]\n\nBeliefs Edit\n\nThe cabal was founded on a series of tenants that could be described as fairly strict, especially by comparison to other religions and organizations in Abeir-Toril. In order to be a member, the member was not permitted to marry or have children. This was done in order to keep the organization strong, since the members would be passing their powers and knowledge onto new members, rather than starting families and having new generations of mages to rival them. Members of the cabal were expected to remain within their ranks, and not to interact with members of other cabals unless absolutely necessary.\n\nOrganization Edit\n\nMembers Edit\n\nThe cabal was composed of both humans and elves. It was led by the Archmage of Water. A position that changed regularly, with a member who had demonstrated leadership qualities.\n\nThe members of the cabal used to meet in the Keep of Thirteen (a structure that rose up out of the sea), and discuss matters important to the Cabal. Since Zz'dtri betrayed the group and stole their immortality spell, the members now are dispersed, and not as organized as they once were.\n\nImportant Events Edit\n\nThe Cabal played a large role in the destruction of the kingdom of Auzkovyn, after which they formed a council to rule over the ruins, they set the place up as a puppet state for them to use as they see fit. It is not clear if they know that the kingdom is now ruled by a Vistani Fyndi through the Mask of Winters.\n\nThe members of the Cabal made themselves known to the world when they came together to defeat Zz'dtri and claim his prize, the Undying Magick.\n\nThey then planned on using this powerful magic to summon Water Dragons to do their bidding.\n\nAfter the Archmage and the Duke of Riva stopped the process, the Cabal members took some time to regroup.\n\nKnown Members Edit\n\nThis list is incomplete.\n\nAbram (member) (founder)\n\nAkusar (member) (founder)\n\nEklusus (member)\n\nThe Duke of Riva (member)\n\nThe Archmage (member)\n\nThe \"Pirate King\"\n\nUnnamed Female Elven Wizard (member)\n\nZz'dtri (former member)\n\nNotable artifacts Edit\n\nFang of Doom, a massive dagger given to The Duke of Riva as a symbol of his membership in the cabal\n\nImmortality Spell, stolen by Zz'dtri and later destroyed\n\nSkull of Vecna, used by The Duke of Riva as a focus for the Undying Magick\n\nThe Whelm of Olios, a magical helm that grants it's wearer greater powers of persuasion.\n\nKeep of Thirteen, an arcane laboratory, and the seat of the cabal.\n\nReferences Edit\n\nSources Edit\n\nOfficial Campaign\n\nUnofficial Campaigns<|endoftext|>While we were all distracted by the theatrics of the right-wing response to the healthcare reform bill, the Senate was engaged in a coup d'état against the American people. The main stream media have managed to keep the story out of the headlines, but it is of critical importance.\n\nEarlier this year, the House passed the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (HR542) which provided that:\n\n\"a new medicine cannot receive FDA approval or be lawfully marketed in the United States unless the sponsor has submitted to the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] any clinical trial information that was in the sponsor's possession on the date of enactment of this Act and the Secretary has received such information before the date on which the sponsor submitted the new medicine application.\"\n\nThe language was an attempt to codify the protection for \"secret science\" that the tobacco industry got from the federal courts. It was an attempt to hide clinical trial data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that manufacturers did not want the public or the agency to see. It was an attempt to require that drug manufacturers be forced to put the public health at risk in order to prevent disclosure of their secret, but flawed, clinical trial data.\n\nIt was an attempt to get around the plain language of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992. In PDUFA, Congress required the submission of all clinical trial data and records to the FDA as a precondition for marketing approval of new drugs and biologics. As Senator Pat Leahy put it at the time:\n\n\"In the past, the FDA had to request the data, then manufacturers would often refuse to comply, and there was no mechanism in the law to force them to provide the information. PDUFA corrects this. PDUFA requires manufacturers to provide the information upon request.\"\n\nThe House bill provided that FDA could not review or rely upon any data submitted after enactment of the law. It was a very carefully written attempt to prevent the FDA from relying upon data in determining whether a drug should be marketed.\n\nThe House and Senate worked out a compromise version of the bill that was finally passed by both houses and signed into law by President Obama on September 27, 2012. The House passed the compromise version with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 396 to 14. The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent.\n\nAs part of the compromise, a few words were changed.\n\n\"The sponsor shall submit to the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] any clinical trial information described in clause (i) that was in the sponsor's possession on the date of enactment of this Act, and the Secretary shall receive such information before the date on which the sponsor submits the application.\"\n\nThose few words mean everything.\n\nThey mean that any information in the possession of a drug manufacturer on the date of enactment of the law in September of 2012, must be submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by the date on which the sponsor submits the application. The sponsor does not have to wait for the FDA to ask for it. The FDA cannot \"compel\" its submission. The FDA cannot take any action to ensure the data is submitted. It is not provided that the FDA cannot \"consider\" the data. It is simply not in the statute.\n\nSince the FDA does not have access to the data, it cannot make a decision on the safety and efficacy of a new drug.\n\nThat means that under this statute, a drug manufacturer can market a new drug without any evidence that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nThat means that the few drugs that are tested must be tested on the American people with absolutely no evidence of safety or efficacy.\n\nThat means that when the FDA is forced to rely upon the manufacturers' representations of the safety and efficacy of their drugs, it must violate its statutory duty to protect the public health.\n\nThat means that no matter how many people die from using the drugs, no matter how many lives are ruined by their use, no matter how many of us become addicted to the drugs, the manufacturers cannot be held accountable for selling a defective product.\n\nThat means that when we allow a manufacturer to market a drug without safety and efficacy evidence, we are engaging in medical malpractice.\n\nThat means that the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012 is the most dangerous piece of legislation that has ever been passed by Congress.\n\nThis is no small thing.\n\nIt is tantamount to a coup d'état against the American people.\n\nIt was the most carefully crafted statute that Congress had ever enacted. The language was not included in the final version of the statute without the most careful and deliberate reflection by both houses of Congress. It was not a matter of oversight. It was not a drafting mistake. It was a deliberate decision by both houses of Congress.\n\nCongress has the power to change the law. As I write this, the Senate is in session. It can go into session on September 8, 2013 to change the law. If the Senate does not act, it will be complicit in the deaths that will occur.\n\nI understand that the Senate will not likely go into session until after the November election. I understand that it will take some time to write a new bill, and then for the President to sign it into law. I understand that there are many problems that Congress needs to deal with, and that healthcare reform is at the top of the list.\n\nBut I know that unless Congress acts, thousands of Americans will die over the next two years as a result of taking drugs that are not safe and effective.\n\nThere is no excuse for not acting to prevent those deaths.\n\nIt is inconceivable that this Congress could stand by while thousands of Americans die. It is unforgivable that Congress could pass legislation that would put the public health at such risk.\n\nIn January of 2009, President Obama said:\n\n\"The days of giving the American people shoddy service or selling them substandard products or even putting their safety at risk in the name of profit are over. \"\n\nCongress' most recent actions go against every promise that the President made.\n\nThere are currently thousands of people who are dying from taking a drug that was not safe and effective.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012"

"Now there’s a timeline that speaks for itself! You know I love all the different artistic angles you can take when creating a timeline. Some are very literal, others are fun and playful, and some are incredibly beautiful. In this case, all of these come into play when you take a look at this timeline of events of the creation of the universe.\n\nTimelines are always fascinating, but when you take a look at this timeline of the events of the creation of the universe, you will be blown away by just how much there is to know about the creation of the universe and all of the events leading up to and after it. As you can see in the photo above, the timeline starts with the beginning of the universe and continues through to the end of the universe, showing you how long the universe has been in existence, what occurred during that time, and even when we think it will end. And the most incredible part is, we actually have a lot of concrete evidence to back up this timeline!\n\nBelow you will find a series of different images, each one of them showing a different section of the timeline that is absolutely incredible.\n\n1. It all starts at the big bang, which occurred approximately 13.7 billion years ago.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n2. Then there is a period of rapid expansion, which scientists call inflation.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n3. And during this period of inflation, the entire universe is born.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n4. During this time, quarks and gluons form to make up the basic ingredients for all matter.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n5. Then the quarks and gluons combine into protons and neutrons.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n6. The universe is filled with hydrogen and helium.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n7. The first stars are formed, which eventually become black holes.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n8. The black holes suck in more and more matter, eventually growing bigger and bigger.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n9. Eventually, the stars die and become supernovas, scattering the universe with the necessary elements for new stars and planets.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n10. Galaxies form, along with the nebulae, black holes, stars and planets.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n11. The earth is formed.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n12. Then 4.5 billion years ago, life begins.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n13. Over time, life on earth begins to evolve and diversify.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n14. Eventually, humans appear.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\n15. About 13.7 billion years after the beginning, life ends, marking the end of the universe.\n\n[Image: Unknown]\n\nI find the entire timeline fascinating, and I really like how it shows how everything seems to fit together. The most important part of this timeline is that it is backed up by science. It’s pretty amazing to know that we are able to actually know when all of these events occurred, as well as when they will occur. How do you like this timeline?

People who make trades — especially large trades — on low-volume days often will not find many partners on the other side of the order book willing to make that trade. The result is that they could end up paying much more for the trade than expected, incurring slippage in the process.\n\nAt this point, you have narrowed down your list to a few cryptos that have a good potential for profitability. But you need to narrow down further and find the ones that have the potential to take-off faster than the rest. That’s why you need to keep in touch with the news. Check out crypto news from different sources to determine, which of the cryptos you have in your bucket-list have some interesting news coming up.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is insanely volatile in 2018. You can make a fortune in a moment and lose it in the next whether you trade Bitcoin, another coin, or the GBTC Bitcoin trust. Consider mitigating risks, hedging, and not “going long” with all your investable funds. TIP: If you trade only the top coins by market cap (that is coins like Bitcoin Ethereum), or GBTC, then the chances of losing everything overnight are slim (not impossible, but slim). Other cryptocurrencies are riskier (but can offer quick gains on a good day).\n\nBitcoin Trading in Tight Range With Lowest Volatility in Months There Was a Major Bug in Bitcoin’s Code, but Developers Fixed it International Bitcoin Transfers 1,000s of Times Cheaper than Banks The CNBC Fast Money Counter Indicator Bitcoin Flash Crash at Cboe XBT Expiration Date; Most Alts Refuse to Panic BTC is Trapped Under Some EMAs and Has Been Most of 2018 GBTC and ETCG Premiums are Melting Off Morgan Stanley To Offer Bitcoin Swap Trading Winklevoss Twins Launch World First Regulated Stablecoin, and It’s Ethereum-Based Goldman Sachs CFO says Bitcoin Trading Desk Rumor is “Fake News”\n\nIf you have an account on Poloniex.com or Bittrex.com (and other crypto exchange sites) you can use their API with TabTrader to easily trade and monitor prices on your phone. It's important to me that the app connects to Poloniex and Bittrex because these exchanges have good volume. And they're pretty credible. TabTrader supports other major exchanges too :)\n\nThe ICON technology (ICX) is incredibly exciting because it aims to harbor the single largest decentralized global network. It aims to provide its users a certain degree of connectivity between countries and cultures around the world that’s currently just not possible or non-existent. This network gives way to businesses and individuals to communicate, transfer, deposit, and in many different ways cooperate with each other in a never seen before way. ICON shows extraordinary potential for the future, but it’s already boasting a large community made of reputable security institutions, banks, hospitals, insurances, universities and institutions in many other sectors. Crucially, ICON is NOT yet tradable in South Korea – when that changes I expect this coin to moon.\n\nWhen Bitcoin forks into a new cryptocurrency… everyone gets free coins. When Bitcoin Cash was created, everyone holding BTC got 1 Cash for every BTC they had. Next time Bitcoin forks this will be true again. NOTE: Forks can be confusing; if you aren’t in the fork for the capture date (which isn’t always clear) you don’t get the free coins.

"Harlan Coben is back on top form. This time around he introduces us to David Gifford, an architect who just wants to build a library in the small town of Lawrenceville. But as the project starts to gain more momentum and publicity, the people who oppose the building are slowly dying, one by one.\n\n\n\nDavid is not your average hero, in fact he’s a bit of an anti-hero. He’s weak, a little cowardly, a smoker, a drinker and not the best looking guy around, but what he lacks in manliness, he more than makes up for in wit and cunning. This is a man who, if he can avoid being killed himself, has a very bright future as a private investigator, and that’s not to say that he doesn’t take risks. He’s a very brave man, but more through luck than any kind of action plan.\n\n\n\nWe’re not talking about a particularly high concept plot here, and Coben does a great job of making us think we know what’s going on, and then throwing us a curveball. He’s so good at this that even when we get to the last page of the book we’re still convinced that we’ve got it all wrong, and we want to read the book again.\n\n\n\nThe story has more than its fair share of twists and turns, and the resolution comes as a surprise, even though we should see it coming a mile off. This is a novel that doesn’t quite hold up to close scrutiny, but Coben puts together a very entertaining piece of writing, and gives the reader everything they need to be entertained. That’s a very rare thing in today’s publishing climate, and it’s not to be missed.\n\n\n\nThe Innocent is a real return to form for Coben, and if you haven’t read his novels in a while, this is a great place to start.\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Choosing a foundation is one of the most important things you do when you put on your makeup.

Two gifted young men--the grandson of a wealthy industrialist and the son of a destitute Irishman--will be thrown together at a high-class military school in England. As their rivalry turns to friendship and their love of art grows, each will inspire the other to achieve a great ambition.\n\nDavid McAlary is the grandson of a wealthy industrialist. Though his family and his money separate him from most of his classmates at the British Royal Naval Academy in Dartmouth, his artistic temperament makes him sensitive to his peers' feelings and puts him at odds with his philistine grandfather.\n\nJoseph O'Connor is the son of an Irish laborer in London. Though his family and his limited education keep him down, his extraordinary talent and his wit win him friends at the academy.\n\nThe boys' friendship will endure long after they leave Dartmouth, through their school days at Oxford and their service together in the Royal Navy. But when each finds success as a painter in France, their destinies take them in different directions. Though their friendship is tested time and again, their desire to succeed as artists and their devotion to each other will be the greatest challenge of all.\n\nAlong the way, readers meet the two men's extraordinary wives--one a Russian princess, the other a French prostitute--as well as a host of eccentrics, models, and dealers, and learn how their relationships influenced their work. Ultimately, this intimate portrait of two men's love for each other, their art, and their times reminds us that for artists, devotion to one's art is the ultimate expression of love.\n\n©2012 Ronald Sassoon (P)2012 Audible, Inc.<|endoftext|>New technologies are frequently introduced into the art world. Most of these innovations fail to catch on with the general public. Most art consumers simply do not know or understand how to use these technologies. However, there are some technologies that have proven successful over the past few years. The following are five innovative technologies that have been embraced by many of today’s consumers.\n\n3D Printing\n\n3D printing is a technology that has been used by artists for some time now. The concept of 3D printing is to print out an object that can be used in a physical capacity. For example, an artist could design a piece of jewelry and print it out to have on display.\n\nHowever, 3D printing has become a lot more popular recently. The reason for this is because of its many practical applications. Artists have been able to use 3D printing in many innovative ways. These new applications include printing out medical models to help doctors in surgery. This technology has also been used to create all sorts of useful items including guns and cars.\n\nRobots\n\nRobots are a form of automation that are used in factories around the world. These robots are used to perform repetitive tasks that would otherwise be dangerous for humans to perform. However, robots have become a lot more popular in the last few years for art. This is because robots have been used to perform various art pieces. These pieces include painting, sculptures, and even music. Robots have also been used in film to do such tasks as generating artificial intelligence.\n\nSocial Media\n\nSocial media sites are some of the most popular online resources. Some sites have even taken their popularity to the next level. Many artists use these sites to promote their work. They use these sites to share updates about their work, show new works, and get feedback from their fans. These artists are using these sites as a new form of marketing.\n\nIoT\n\nIoT, or internet of things, is a new form of technology that allows users to connect things to the internet. Many people use IoT to connect to different things. For example, users can connect their television sets to the internet to connect with other users. Users can also connect various home appliances to the internet to get more use out of them. Users can also connect things like their cars to the internet.\n\nThe connection of things to the internet has been a game changer for artists. These artists have used IoT to create some really interesting pieces. Artists have connected things like paint and lights to the internet to create amazing pieces of art. Artists have even connected refrigerators and soda machines to the internet to get more use out of them.<|endoftext|>As I walked along a footpath one summer day in 2011, the sparrows scattered into the long grass and weeds of a field. As I looked up, I saw the cause of their alarm.\n\nIt was a day so still that the heat seemed to be shimmering. In the distance I saw a flock of sheep being driven across a field by their shepherd. There was a small horse trotting along beside the sheepdog. Then, from the direction of the sheep came a larger dog, looking bigger and bigger as it ran, jaws open.\n\nWhen the dog was almost on top of the sheep and the shepherd, it dropped its head and took a bite at the nearest sheep. It jumped back to the ground and watched the shepherd move the sheep away from the horse. Then the dog came back for another bite.\n\nWhen the shepherd had moved the sheep away, the dog stayed where it was, watching the shepherd and the sheep as they moved further away, the horse following them. It waited, jaws open, for a long time.\n\nThen it turned and ran off across the field and out of sight.<|endoftext|>De rit naar Espanola is bijna zover!

"In response to the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017, two physicians at Yale New Haven Hospital shared their thoughts about the need for sensible gun control laws and the potential health consequences of political inaction.\n\nThe statements were emailed to the Register as follows:\n\nDr. Janis Orlowski, chief medical officer of the Emergency Department at Yale New Haven Hospital:\n\nAs a public health physician, I have seen the devastation that gun violence can inflict. When someone is shot, even with the best care available, that person is often still changed forever.\n\nAs an ER doctor, I have cared for young patients and parents who have been shot in schools, neighborhoods, movie theaters, and bars. I have cared for children who were victims of gun violence and parents who were killed while shielding their children.\n\nAt work, I have treated police officers and first responders who have been shot and patients with gunshot wounds who are out of surgery but will require many months or years of rehabilitation to return to normal activities.\n\nThese experiences inform my position on the need for sensible gun control laws.\n\nWe must prevent the proliferation of firearms in our communities. For too long we have tried to address gun violence through reactionary approaches. But it is clear that more laws are needed to prevent guns from falling into the hands of people who should not have them. We must also invest in mental health and suicide prevention programs, especially in communities where access to care is limited.\n\nLives are at stake. And the burden of addressing gun violence can’t fall on first responders and medical professionals. This is a public health issue.\n\nDr. Stephen Feller, Yale New Haven Hospital, vice chairman of emergency medicine:\n\nA week after the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, the situation is still a blur. Although I was watching on television, it is not as if I could just turn the set off. For me, as a public health physician, the hours following this tragic shooting in the Las Vegas outdoor concert venue made me even more convinced of the urgent need for sensible gun control legislation.\n\nWe are fortunate to live in a community with a number of programs for injury prevention and control. But after each mass shooting, we see the damage that one person can do.\n\nEach incident is more devastating than the last and is becoming more frequent. The results are horrendous: numbers of deaths and injuries, but also a shift in our thinking that no longer view such incidents as a remote possibility.\n\nI agree with Dr. Orlowski and the many other colleagues who have shared their thoughts on the need for sensible gun control legislation.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about this column, please contact Dr. Orlowski at jorlowski@ynhh.org.<|endoftext|>Two of the biggest stories in the world of esports today are one: the ongoing lawsuit between Riot Games and Magic: The Gathering creator Wizards of the Coast over intellectual property; and two: the issues surrounding the current state of Counter-Strike’s competitive scene and the controversy that has come with it.\n\nFor now, let’s focus on that first one: the lawsuit. Back in March, Riot filed a lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast in a California district court, alleging that “Wizards has wrongfully filed and maintained two trademark applications on the word ‘DOTA’” and has sought to “block Riot from using the mark ‘DOTA,’ which has been in use by Riot for nearly eight years,” according to the statement.\n\nFor those not following the case too closely, Riot claimed that Wizards has used “threats of litigation” to prevent them from using the term “DOTA”. In an interview with the esports and culture media outlet The Score, Riot president Marc Merrill confirmed that, “Yes, that is what happened. I don’t think it’s ever a good thing to be threatened by anyone with litigation. I think that if you have to go to court, that’s what courts are for.”\n\nThe court’s response to Riot’s allegations? “Magic: The Gathering, the popular card game that started it all, was released in 1993, the same year as the video game Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, from Blizzard Entertainment. The Warcraft video game was licensed from the card game, which is one of the main reasons for Magic: The Gathering’s original name. And while the games differ, Blizzard has acknowledged that the character Arthas, from the Warcraft series, was named after the character Arthas Menethil from the card game.”\n\nAfter that, the response explained how Wizards has used the term “DOTA” for years, “including ‘DOTA’s’ use as a registered mark for, among other things, trading cards, game software, and entertainment services. ‘DOTA’s’ registration for the trading card game expired in 2011. But that registration was not the first, as Riot has argued. Rather, it was the seventh registration that ‘DOTA’ has received from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. ‘DOTA’ has been a registered mark of Wizards for over thirteen years.”\n\nRiot tried to assert that Riot had “acquired” “DOTA” by incorporating the term into their “League of Legends” game, and that Riot had the right to use the term. The court disagreed, and instead found that Riot was actually the one infringing on Wizards’s trademark, writing that, “The District Court noted that ‘DOTA’ was coined and first used by [Riot’s predecessor] Blizzard to describe a class of computer games, that Riot ‘was aware of [that use] at least as early as 2008,’ and that ‘at some point after 2008, Riot Games deliberately changed the [League of Legends] mode name from “Defense of the Ancients” to “DOTA.’”\n\nThis ruling is important because, as the lawsuit shows, Riot has knowingly and willfully used a trademark that belongs to someone else. If Riot is found guilty of the charges, they could face financial damages as well as a prohibition from using the term “DOTA” in any capacity. As the court ruling read, “Riot will not be allowed to ‘use’ DOTA as a trademark in connection with its products and services, including use in connection with its League of Legends game and merchandise.”\n\nThe response also explained that, “Riot Games’s misuse of Wizards’s ‘DOTA’ trademark is a clear attempt to confuse consumers into believing that ‘DOTA’ refers to Riot Games’s products. This is accomplished by using the name ‘DOTA’ as an acronym for the video game League of Legends, even though ‘DOTA’ is the name of a specific computer game mode in Warcraft III and its derivatives, and not a generic term for ‘Defense of the Ancients.’”\n\nThe court ruling also notes that, “The issue is not whether the ‘DOTA’ computer game mode or name is better or more popular than Riot Games’s League of Legends. Rather, the issue is whether Riot’s infringement of Wizards’s trademark was willful and malicious, thereby justifying an award of exemplary damages under California law.”\n\nRiot could still potentially win the lawsuit, and as Merrill stated in The Score interview, “We want people to know we’re serious about [the lawsuit].” However, the court’s ruling is looking more and more favorable to Wizards, and a future ruling from the court will probably result in Riot having to pay compensation to Wizards of the Coast for their infringement on Wizards’s trademark.\n\nThe second part of this story, however, is a bit different.\n\nAt the beginning of March, the esports tournament organizer FACEIT announced that the Esports Championship Series (ECS) would be moving to a franchising model. Afterward, TEO reached out to a number of people in the Counter-Strike community to get their thoughts on the change, including Richard Lewis, owner of the esports news outlet Richard Lewis Online, and Duncan “Thorin” Shields, professional esports journalist. The problem was that this was all announced on the same day that the two parties, Lewis and Shields, announced that they would be parting ways with their respective outlets, as well as taking time off of social media. This was particularly notable because Lewis and Shields had a working relationship for over a decade.\n\nThe day after the announcement, Lewis explained in a series of tweets that the split had been amicable and that, while the future of his site was uncertain, he was not stepping away from esports journalism. As of now, Lewis has returned to social media and his site is running, while Shields is still on hiatus.\n\nHowever, according to a report from Dot Esports, “When [FACEIT] announced its plans, it did so without consulting its partner teams.” The article went on to explain that, while FACEIT had claimed that the new model would increase revenue to the teams participating, and thus increase the amount of money that could be paid to players, “none of the teams TEO contacted agreed with the potential benefits of such a move.”\n\nThe article also explained that, “When a representative from one of the top teams reached out to Lewis for help in understanding the situation, the industry veteran encouraged them to join his team in voting against the move. According to Lewis, his response was that"
"Under an order signed Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), federally funded clinics must consider the “conscience rights” of health care providers when offering treatment. Under the rule, doctors and nurses can claim religious or moral objections and deny patients reproductive health care services such as birth control and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe rule expands an earlier policy created under the Bush administration, which had barred clinics and hospitals that receive federal funding from discriminating against providers who refuse to participate in abortion procedures or “otherwise facilitate” abortions.\n\nThe Trump administration has aggressively expanded these so-called conscience protections. HHS has already reversed Obama-era rules that prevented federally funded foster care and adoption agencies from discriminating against same-sex couples and opened the door for federal workers to refuse to serve transgender people. The agency is also working to give health care workers the right to refuse transgender patients in state-funded health care programs.\n\n“The rights of conscience are already protected,” Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office of Civil Rights, told reporters on a call Friday. “We are adding clarity, we are not changing the policy at all.”\n\nNancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement that the new rule “would enshrine a right to discriminate in federal law.”\n\n“It’s part of an alarming trend by the Trump administration to willfully ignore the healthcare needs of women and transgender people,” she said.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue accused the Trump administration of waging “a war on science, women, our well-being, and our health care.”\n\n“If a doctor or nurse objects to a patient’s medical treatment — because they are women, LGBTQ, or otherwise — the doctor or nurse can deny them the care they seek,” Hogue said. “This move will put many women in harm’s way.”\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Health and Human Services said the rule would “build upon the vital work” of the original regulation, which was challenged by a lawsuit filed by California. The state argued that the Bush-era policy violated federal anti-discrimination law and the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which prohibits laws that favor one religion over another.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, ruling in 2016 that federal law did not allow “religiously motivated denials of service by medical providers who accept and receive government funding.” The three-judge panel sent the case back to the district court to work out a settlement between the parties. California and the federal government reached a deal in July 2017 that gave doctors and nurses more latitude to object to treatment but did not expand the list of services.\n\nFriday’s announcement is the Trump administration’s response to California’s lawsuit. Under the new rule, doctors and nurses in California and other states that receive federal funding to provide health care would be allowed to refuse to provide reproductive services and treatment for gender transition.\n\nNurses and doctors at the more than 5,000 hospitals and clinics across the U.S. that provide family planning and reproductive health services receive federal funding. These programs include the Title X Family Planning Program, which serves 4 million people annually, and Medicaid, which is jointly funded by the state and federal government and provides health coverage to more than 70 million low-income people.\n\nIn Friday’s call with reporters, Severino said that these programs already have mechanisms in place to help patients obtain health care if a provider denies them treatment. “No one is forced to have an abortion,” Severino said. “This is a question of prioritizing government programs and where taxpayer money should be spent.”\n\nSeverino said the policy would not require doctors and nurses to participate in or perform procedures that violate their beliefs. “No one is forcing them to do anything that they don’t want to do,” he said.\n\nThe new rule could affect patients who live in rural areas, where there may not be another provider to serve them. And in some cases, women may be forced to travel hundreds of miles to obtain a procedure.<|endoftext|>Search for:\n\nPaintjob Range: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Coolness Range: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Auctions:\n\nShow Everything Only show auctions Results per page:\n\n30 60 90 Results per line:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 Thumbnail Size:\n\nSmall Medium Large First, sort by:\n\nPaintjob rating (best to worst) Paintjob rating (worst to best) Coolness rating (best to worst) Coolness rating (worst to best) Overall rating (best to worst) Overall rating (worst to best) Image Uploaded (recent to oldest) Image Uploaded (oldest to recent) Image Size (biggest to smallest) Image Size (smallest to biggest) Views (most to least) Views (least to most) Votes (most to least) Votes (least to most) Comments (most to least) Comments (least to most) Auction (ending soon to ending last) Auction (ending last to ending soon) Auction (most expensive to least expensive) Auction (least expensive to most expensive) Auction (most bids to least bids) Auction (least bids to most bids) Image Title (Alphabetical ascending) Image Title (Alphabetical descending) Then, sort by:\n\nNothing Paintjob rating (best to worst) Paintjob rating (worst to best) Coolness rating (best to worst) Coolness rating (worst to best) Average rating (best to worst) Average rating (worst to best) Image Uploaded (recent to oldest) Image Uploaded (oldest to recent) Image Size (biggest to smallest) Image Size (smallest to biggest) Views (most to least) Views (least to most) Votes (most to least) Votes (least to most) Comments (most to least) Comments (least to most) Auction (ending soon to ending last) Auction (ending last to ending soon) Auction (most expensive to least expensive) Auction (least expensive to most expensive) Auction (most bids to least bids) Auction (least bids to most bids) Image Title (Alphabetical ascending) Image Title (Alphabetical descending) Search in images tagged:\n\nAnything Abstract Art Show all.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled on Tuesday that the program “must stay” in place while lawsuits against the Trump administration continue.\n\nIn a 48-page ruling, Alsup said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, must remain in effect as challenges to the decision by the Trump administration to end the program move forward. The judge’s ruling does not require the government to accept new applications for DACA protections.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration said it would end DACA, which President Obama had implemented in 2012 to provide work permits and temporary protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nDACA recipients are commonly known as “dreamers,” after the DREAM Act, legislation that would have provided them a path to citizenship. The bill has been introduced multiple times in Congress but has failed to pass. The Supreme Court is expected to soon rule on whether Trump acted legally when he moved to end DACA.\n\nThe DACA program provides two-year renewable work permits to eligible immigrants who came to the U.S. before the age of 16. They must have a high school diploma or GED and must not have a criminal record. The move by Trump to rescind DACA prompted a flurry of lawsuits across the country.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, ruled on Tuesday that the plaintiffs challenging Trump’s decision “have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the rescission of DACA was arbitrary and capricious.”\n\nThe judge wrote in his ruling that the Department of Homeland Security’s “legal judgment” was “virtually unexplained” and did not “offend” the law. The court papers filed by the department’s lawyers offered “no solid basis” for the finding that DACA was unlawful and unconstitutional, Alsup said.\n\nThe ruling was met with a jubilant response from supporters of DACA, who were in court in San Francisco on Tuesday to hear the judge’s decision.\n\nEvan Wolfson, president of the group Freedom for Immigrants, said, “The judge’s decision, that DACA must stay in place while the legal cases play out, is a major blow to the Trump administration’s cruel and xenophobic assault on immigrant youth.”\n\nAdvocates for DACA recipients, however, will need to keep up"
"Back in February 2017, right before Super Bowl 51, Adweek shared that the Atlanta Falcons would not have a single ad during the game. This is particularly odd because not only did they win the game, but they were defending the NFC title. It’s a pretty easy chance to get noticed and generate some buzz.\n\nWell, that ended up being a really poor decision. Not only did they not get much media attention or press, but they didn’t even have a presence at the event. It was all the Patriots that night.\n\nThis is just one example of many where good marketers can lose a ton of exposure because they don’t know how to market well.\n\nLuckily, you can learn from these mistakes. Today, I’ll share the four most common marketing mistakes NFL teams make and how you can avoid them.\n\nThey Spend Too Much Time on Developing the Perfect Strategy\n\nThe perfect marketing strategy can take weeks to put together. Sometimes even months. Teams have to come up with their own unique way of expressing their story, which is no easy task.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be.\n\nYou need to start simple. At least at first. Do your research and develop a plan that you can execute right away. Then, from there, you can learn from your first experiences and develop new ways to share your story over time.\n\nA lot of times, teams don’t get a chance to do that. They lose all their momentum because they waited too long.\n\nThey Use the Same Strategy Every Year\n\nOne of the worst things you can do as a marketer is use the same strategy over and over again. Every year, we have new teams and new opportunities. It’s really important that you adjust your marketing strategy based on what works and what doesn’t.\n\nRemember that we don’t have to reinvent the wheel. But if you’re using the same methods, you’re not giving yourself enough opportunities to stand out.\n\nThey Focus Too Much on Strategy Instead of Execution\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes I see in NFL marketing is that people get so caught up in coming up with the perfect strategy that they never actually put any of their ideas into action. They get caught up in the strategy stage and don’t execute their plans.\n\nBut we can’t do that.\n\nYou have to focus on execution. This is the part where you actually get out there and do the work. This is where you move from theory to reality. When you only focus on strategy, you miss out on valuable time to make your brand more successful.\n\nThey Fail to Monitor Progress\n\nA common problem with NFL teams is that they don’t measure the impact of their marketing efforts. They don’t keep track of the things that are working and the things that are not.\n\nYou have to be able to monitor your progress. What kind of feedback are you getting? What kind of exposure are you getting? If you don’t know what’s working, then you’re going to struggle to improve in the future.\n\nThis is where the data comes in. It’s important to be able to measure your success so you can adjust accordingly.\n\nDon’t let the NFL be a fool. Don’t make these same mistakes.\n\nAvoid the following common mistakes that NFL teams make and you’ll be off to a great start.\n\nQuestions?\n\nLet me know your questions about sports marketing in the comments below.<|endoftext|>I'd have to agree, I think this is one of the worst MH games ever. The first thing you notice is the graphics.\n\n\n\nI remember playing MH3U on my 3DS XL in early 2013, and thinking \"Damn this is a great game. This is one of the best games for the 3DS right now.\" Well, MH4U was released just two months later, and then that thought was wiped from my mind.\n\n\n\nNow, I don't want to compare MH4U to MH3U, because there's a lot of things that are different in both games. But the one thing I notice about MH4U, and MH Generations as well, is the game's art style. It's really different.\n\n\n\nNow I'm not saying that it's ugly, but it's different. I was so used to the MH3/MH3U art style, that this new one just seems so... out of place. I think it could have been good, but it just doesn't look right, even on a bigger screen. And if you're playing it on a 3DS XL, you'll really notice how different the art style is.\n\n\n\nAs for gameplay, I feel like MH4U's gameplay isn't as good as MH3U. It's not that MH3U is \"better\" or \"worse\", but just a lot of things in MH4U are a bit worse, in my opinion.\n\n\n\nAlso, what really turns me off of MH4U is the lack of content.\n\n\n\nI understand it's a port of MH4G, but just, I felt that MH3U had so much more content than this.\n\n\n\nWhen you talk about the monsters, MH3U has all monsters from MH3, MH3U, MH3U G, and MH4.\n\n\n\nWhile MH4U only has some monsters from MH3U, some new monsters, and I think the Zinogre and Deviant monsters, but not much else.\n\n\n\nWhen you talk about the areas, MH3U has 5 different islands to explore, while MH4U only has 1, I think.\n\n\n\nWhen you talk about quests, MH3U has about 150, and MH4U has about 140.\n\n\n\nAlso, MH3U has a much longer story than MH4U. And that's what really makes MH3U a great game. The story is really deep, you meet new people, the characters are great, the fights are epic, and the environments are just amazing.\n\n\n\nMH4U's story is a bit different. It's a bit shorter than MH3U's, and there's a lot of changes in the story that I really didn't like. But I'm not going to get into that, because I don't want to spoil it for you.\n\n\n\nI also don't like the changes to the Hunter Arts, and the Styles, they're not as good as the ones in MH3U. I prefer the styles from MH3U over MH4U.\n\n\n\nAnd the Palicoes are also a bit different. I didn't like that Palicoes didn't heal you when you're in a team, and I really didn't like that I couldn't ride a mount in my first mission.\n\n\n\nAnd the Village is really different as well. And I didn't like that you couldn't take the Wycoon on quests anymore, or have them \"join\" you in a quest. I don't like that you can't just check the daily board and see what kind of quests you have. You have to actually travel to the Quest counter to see that.\n\n\n\nAs for things that are good in MH4U, there isn't much. I like the weapon upgrade system. I like how we can use stuff we get in quests, in MH3U, we can't. And I like that we can use the stuff from the Monster Hunter series in MH4U, which was something I liked in MH3U, but wasn't in MH3.\n\n\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. I know that I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but this is my opinion, and it's pretty much what I feel. I really don't like MH4U as much as MH3U. MH3U is a much better game in my opinion.\n\n\n\nI still really like the Monster Hunter series though. But MH3U and MH4U are the only games that I play, and I just really didn't like MH4U.\n\n\n\nMy final opinion on MH4U? It's a good game, but it's one of the worst Monster Hunter games ever. It's not as good as MH3U, which I really, really like.<|endoftext|>More Videos...\n\n\n\nFord Taurus - Two Cars With One Car!\n\nWhile cruising around the city, it is possible to drive two cars from one car by just pressing the corresponding L/R buttons on the shifter.\n\n[FORD] ESCANEANDO A TUARUS (GolGator-0005)\n\n[FORD] ESCANEANDO A TUARUS\n\nFord Taurus 2002 Tx 8E03-1082 @ Ótimo estado (\n\nFord Taurus 2002 TX 8E03-1082 Câmbio Automático Rádio / CD 4x4 Motor 3.0 V6 - Ótimo estado - Estará na minha garagem, porém não abrirei a porta para ninguém, visto que não é o certo.<|endoftext|>Set on a heavily wooded estate, the Lichfield Hotel Resort offers accommodation with the great outdoors on its doorstep.

"Until now, one of the major downsides to Ubuntu Touch has been the lack of support for LTE connections. Most of us are used to working on Wi-Fi, but being able to switch to mobile data is a huge advantage. If you need to download large files, it’s a lot quicker and more convenient to do so on 4G than it is on a Wi-Fi network.\n\nBut, as of the Ubuntu 14.04.3 release, Canonical has announced that the mobile network support is now working for all supported phones, both the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 7 2013, but it’s still not turned on by default. That’s why it’s important to know how to turn it on.\n\nThe Mobile Data option is hidden deep inside the settings menu. To get there, you’ll need to navigate to Settings > Connectivity > Mobile Networks. You’ll notice that there are two sections in this menu, one for Data Roaming, and one for Enable LTE. In both sections, simply select the tick box next to Enable and you’re good to go.\n\nUbuntu Touch is still in the very early stages of development, but the fact that we’re getting these kind of features now means that the platform will get better and better with every update. I’m definitely glad to see that I won’t have to rely on Wi-Fi in the future to get online.<|endoftext|>10.3.2015\n\nOn Thursday, October 1, members of Local 28, working under a variation to the contract, will be performing various types of line painting and line patching on the transit system.\n\nAll bus routes will be running as normal on this date, however, if there is a delay of 15 minutes or more, the vehicle will be removed from service and a spare bus will take its place.\n\nCustomers may also notice members of Local 28 working along bus routes in order to perform work on switches.\n\nThe work will be performed between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on October 1, and between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on October 2.<|endoftext|>After playing its first home game at Fargodome this season, North Dakota State has three of its last four games away from home, including a trip to Indiana State.\n\nThe Bison have a new starting quarterback in redshirt freshman Easton Stick and a trip to face Indiana State on Nov. 14 should provide a big test. The Sycamores are 6-3 with wins over two Football Championship Subdivision opponents and a loss to a Football Bowl Subdivision team, Tennessee State.\n\nA win would boost NDSU's hopes for an at-large spot in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision tournament, while a loss could knock the Bison out of the playoffs.\n\nHere are five things to watch in this matchup between a pair of Football Championship Subdivision unbeatens:\n\nDETERMINED DREY\n\nIndiana State senior defensive end Jake Drey's performance will likely determine the outcome of this game.\n\nNDSU coach Chris Klieman called Drey a \"very good football player.\" The Bison's offensive line was inconsistent in last week's win over South Dakota State, so Drey and his defensive line mates will need to pressure Stick into making some mistakes.\n\n\"They've got good players all around,\" Klieman said. \"He's the guy that plays the position that can wreak havoc in the backfield.\"\n\nNDSU's offensive line must block Drey one-on-one if possible and allow Stick time to get the ball out. Klieman said he expects the Bison to be in three-wide receiver sets and Stick to use the screen game to pick up yards.\n\nTOUGH ROAD TEST\n\nNDSU is one of two unbeaten teams in the Missouri Valley Football Conference, and the Bison are the conference's only team that is 7-0 overall.\n\nIndiana State, a member of the Missouri Valley, would love to end NDSU's undefeated run. Klieman said he expects the Sycamores to put a lot of pressure on the Bison and \"throw everything at us.\"\n\n\"We've just got to stay calm, be ourselves and stay with our process,\" Klieman said. \"That's what we did last week. We just got to be able to stay with it, protect the football and run the football.\"\n\nCOMEBACK ATTEMPTS\n\nWhile NDSU's offense is still trying to find its groove, the Bison have already shown they are willing to make a game of it in the second half.\n\nNDSU has been in two tight games this season -- at Iowa State and against South Dakota -- and the Bison have come from behind to win both times. Last week, NDSU led 14-0 at halftime, then scored 17 points in the third quarter to put away South Dakota State.\n\n\"We've just got to stay patient,\" NDSU quarterback Easton Stick said. \"We've got to let the game come to us. We can't go into a game trying to force anything. That's the big thing.\"\n\nRECEIVER RUSH\n\nIndiana State's secondary has been outstanding this season, and the team's top two receivers -- Demetrius Dean and Jonathan Shepherd -- could provide NDSU with a good test.\n\nDean leads the team with 45 catches for 531 yards and three touchdowns. Shepherd has 40 catches for 662 yards and seven scores. NDSU senior cornerback Marcus Williams said it will be critical for him to be more aggressive against the two Indiana State receivers.\n\n\"They're really shifty, so we've got to play press coverage,\" Williams said. \"They have good hands and good routes, so we've got to play our technique and go from there.\"\n\nBACKUP QBS\n\nNDSU's redshirt freshman quarterbacks, Stick and redshirt sophomore Easton Pedersen, are both coming off their first starts in a Bison uniform.\n\nPedersen threw a touchdown pass, but NDSU coaches felt Stick made a better decision with the ball. Klieman said both players will get a chance to play this season and possibly this week.\n\n\"Easton (Pedersen) and Easton (Stick) are two young guys that are competing for playing time, and we're going to go with the guy that gives us the best chance to win,\" Klieman said.<|endoftext|>Now updated to include new chapters on C# 4.0 and Visual Basic 2010, this book takes you beyond basic and intermediate C# and Visual Basic programming, to the realm of expert programming and development.

At the time the stock was trading at $133.73, and has now declined to around $114. Now that I’ve thought more about this stock, and done more research, I think I was too conservative. I think ROK is a very good buy right now. Here’s why.\n\n1. One company selling two product families for double digit revenue growth\n\nROK sells two product families. The first is the automation and control group, and this division accounts for 53% of ROK’s revenues. This division sells software, hardware, and systems that help run the factory and control it. The second division is industrial automation, and this division accounts for 47% of ROK’s revenues. This division sells systems that manage machines in a factory.\n\nThe good news for ROK is that both divisions are growing. In the company’s most recent quarter, revenue from both divisions grew double digits. However, the software and control division grew much more quickly than the industrial automation division. Revenue from the software and control division grew 27% year over year, while revenue from the industrial automation division grew 11%.\n\nBut this is only part of the story. Because of the nature of ROK’s product families, ROK is able to sell products from one division to the other. That is, a company can buy automation software to run its machines, but then add control systems that are compatible with the software to make the factory run more efficiently.\n\nTo put this another way, a company can buy a ROK product for its machines, but then add another ROK product for the automation and control. That adds another 11% growth to the software and control revenue stream.\n\nIn fact, this is exactly what ROK has been doing. The industrial automation division has been growing more quickly than the software and control division, but it hasn’t been growing as quickly as it might have been. That’s because ROK has been using its software and control division to promote its industrial automation business.\n\nThat’s why the software and control division has been growing faster than the industrial automation division.\n\nIn addition, the industrial automation division hasn’t been growing as quickly as it might have been because the company is also using the software and control division to promote its industrial automation division.\n\nThe bottom line is that ROK has been able to make both divisions grow faster than they might have been growing, by using one division to promote the other. And this isn’t a trick. The two divisions are compatible. So ROK is actually growing these divisions together.\n\nIn other words, ROK is growing two divisions for double digit revenue growth.\n\n2. An acquisition in the industrial automation division, and more acquisitions\n\nOne of the reasons why ROK has been able to grow these two divisions for double digit revenue growth is because the company has been able to acquire companies that were compatible with its software and control systems, but were not competitive. This helps ROK offer more of what customers want, while reducing the amount of development that ROK has to do itself.\n\nFor example, in April of this year ROK acquired the assets of xsensor. In a press release ROK said, “The Company believes the purchase of xsensor will further expand its presence in the field of Wireless Industrial Automation, expanding its position as a full lifecycle provider of wireless industrial automation solutions.”\n\nThere are no similar language in press releases about acquisitions in the software and control division. So acquisitions in the industrial automation division are helping both divisions grow faster.\n\nAnd the acquisitions in the industrial automation division have been less complex and less expensive than the acquisitions in the software and control division. So these acquisitions will be less costly than the acquisitions in the software and control division, which means that ROK can continue to grow the industrial automation division faster than it’s growing the software and control division.\n\n3. A company that knows how to grow both divisions, and how to manage the growth\n\nBack in June I wrote about the growth story in the industrial automation division, and suggested that this division would continue to grow faster than the software and control division.\n\nIn the comments to this article, one investor wrote that he thought that the software and control division would continue to grow faster than the industrial automation division.\n\nI think he was wrong, and here’s why. In its most recent quarter, the industrial automation division showed some problems in its manufacturing and financial systems divisions.\n\nA company that knows how to grow the software and control division, and manages the growth of this division, is more likely to manage the growth of the industrial automation division than a company that doesn’t know how to manage the growth of the software and control division.\n\nHere’s why. When a company is growing, it often finds that it needs to make acquisitions in order to keep growing. This is the case with both divisions at ROK. When ROK needs to make an acquisition, it needs to make a judgment about the quality of the acquisition. If it’s a poor quality acquisition, then the division it’s adding could be a drag on the division it’s adding to.\n\nSo the more complex a division is, the more likely that ROK will get a bad acquisition, and the more likely it will be that the bad acquisition will hurt the other division. And the more likely it will be that the other division will have a problem, and that the other division will have a problem.\n\nThis is where managing growth is important. A company that knows how to grow one division, and manages the growth of this division, is more likely to know how to grow the other division, and manage the growth of the other division.\n\n4. A company that knows how to manage a declining business\n\nIn its most recent quarter, ROK had a declining business in its discrete manufacturing business. This is the business where ROK sells discrete controls, such as circuit breakers and fuses.\n\nOver the last few years, ROK has been losing share in this market, and this quarter it lost more share.\n\nThe problem that the company has is that its new products can’t displace its older products, because they can’t operate together. So ROK is going to have to keep selling its older products in this business, because it has no alternative.\n\nROK is trying to mitigate the problems in this business by reducing costs, and trying to promote its other businesses.\n\nThe problem is that the amount that the company can reduce costs in this business is limited, because this is a mature business, and ROK has already been cutting costs in this business for a long time.\n\nSo it looks like ROK is going to continue to see declining revenues in this business, and it’s going to continue to see declining margins in this business.\n\nHowever, the company has a history of managing declining businesses. For example, ROK’"

Prior to joining Interboro in 2011, he worked with Michael Manfredi and The Architect’s Newspaper, designing two national competitions: The Downtown Project in Las Vegas, Nevada; and the Memphis Meets Me competition. He has a Masters in Architecture from Harvard University Graduate School of Design, and received his Bachelor of Architecture from the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City, Mexico. In 2009 he won the Domus Latinoamericana Award, and the Pratt Institute Meyer Travel Grant.\n\nSitting inside a former historic home at 14th and T, Raúl was joined by his friend and colleague Ildar Gilyazutdinov.\n\nCan you talk about the development of the Rosy-Homes?\n\nA couple of years ago, I was on a plane heading from New York to Venice to visit my girlfriend. On the plane was this guy, a Russian architect, and he was talking to me about the development of the Russian program, and I was like, “what the fuck?” because he kept talking about this architectural program, but then I was like, “OK, I guess that’s it”. Then we get off the plane and it turns out we are going to the same place. The guy picks me up and he starts talking about this architectural program called “The Rosy-Homes”, and how we were going to build this thing that would be like this fake house, and how this guy from Harvard, who is a good friend of his, was going to do this project. It was for him. He was a crazy man. He’s one of the most famous Russian architects, and he would pick these people, put them together in a house and live with them for two months, working on this project. We were going to be the first group in this house.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nWe didn’t know what was going on, but we’re going to Venice for three days, and this guy, this architect, lived in Italy for a while and he still has a house there. He’s like, “let’s go!”. We were like, “OK!”.\n\nThe Rosy-Homes were in the development of an abandoned building that had been left for decades. They were trying to renovate it, and they had three architects in the house at the time.\n\nThen one day, this guy came in the house and he was like, “my god, it’s been two months”. It was the last two months of the year and he had to go to Russia. We had this big Christmas party and he was like, “I can’t go back.” He came to the US in ‘72, and he hasn’t seen his country in like 40 years. He says, “I can’t go back, but I want to go.” So we’re like, “let’s go!”. So he just goes and he invites us to come to Russia. I got my friends to come, and we go to Russia for three months. It’s crazy.\n\nIt was like the Wild West in Russia.\n\nIt was like the Wild West. There’s no real laws in place.\n\nIt was also my first experience of actually being in the USSR in 1990s.\n\nWe go back to Moscow, and he says, “you guys should stay. I’m going to be working here, you guys should stay.”\n\nI have a friend from Harvard, Eduardo de la Riva, and he’s from Colombia, and he came to see me in Mexico. So we’re all like, “fuck, let’s go!”. We started this project, and I have no idea how it happened, but I have no idea how it happened. We were working with a collective of architects from Moscow, like six people.\n\nWe started this project, and the Russian guy’s telling me how to do this project, and I’m like, “dude, I don’t know. I’m sorry.” He’s like, “don’t worry, I’m going to take care of it”. We start working on this project, and he says, “it’s going to be the Rosy-Homes”. Then he starts talking to the curator at the Garage Museum, and we’re just working on the project and then suddenly it’s like, “okay, you’re invited to do this exhibition at the Garage Museum.” And I’m like, “no way.” And he’s like, “don’t worry. I’m going to take care of it.”\n\nWe started working with another friend of ours, who is a photographer, and he’s like, “fuck, let’s do this.” And he starts taking pictures.\n\nAt the same time, I’m living with another guy from Harvard, Paul Lyons. He was doing a project with another guy, and they wanted to do something in Moscow.\n\nHow did the three of you get in contact?\n\nI have no idea. We didn’t know each other, but it was like, “you’re the architect, you’re the artist, you’re the photographer.” “No, I’m not, you are.” “No, you are.” “Let’s just go!” “Let’s go!”.\n\nAt the same time, Paul’s also working with another"

"Kimchi (kimchee) is a Korean dish which is well known throughout the world. It is a spicy, tangy and pungent food that contains pickled vegetables. The word \"Kimchi\" comes from the Korean \"Kim\" meaning \"turn\" and \"Chi\" meaning \"sauce\".\n\nKimchi consists of vegetables which are salted, fermented and seasoned. It is an important part of the Korean diet. The two main methods of preparing Kimchi are fermentation and salting. Fermented Kimchi is made by mixing cabbage, radish and other vegetables with a specific kind of salt and sugar. Salted Kimchi is made by mixing cabbage, radish and other vegetables with a specific amount of salt and some vinegar.\n\nThe standard vegetables used in preparing Kimchi include cabbage, radish, turnip and Chinese cabbage. However, there are many different variations of Kimchi. Some of the variations include Kimchi with beef, Kimchi with fish and Kimchi with soybean paste.\n\nThe preparation of Kimchi is considered to be an important part of Korean culture. It is prepared in a ritualistic manner. The Korean culture also consider it as a \"doorway\" to a family's hearth.<|endoftext|>A.I.

It's clear that they do not have an editor to tinker with their wonderful work. There are certainly mistakes, not to mention outright errors and failures of continuity, but it's just so good I can't help but love it.\n\n1. To Live by Yu Hua\n\nMy own favourite of the year. To Live, or Huozhe, as it's known in China, is the modern-day story of a girl who grows up in the shadow of the Cultural Revolution in China in the 1960s and 70s. It is a novel full of vivid and often disturbing imagery, with characters so well developed that they seem like living, breathing people. This is a book about life in China, and is both engrossing and thought provoking. If I'm not mistaken, this is the first translated work by Yu Hua to be published in English. It is long, at more than 600 pages, but I would have read it twice if I had the time.\n\n2. The Dwarf by Miguel de Cervantes\n\nThe oldest book on this list, The Dwarf, published in 1604, is the second part of a trilogy. It is another book I have not finished, but which I am still going through at the moment. I could list everything that is wrong with the book: the lack of coherence in the story, the pointless subplots and characters, the cliched dialogue, but despite all this I still find it so entertaining, so fascinating that I can't help but carry on reading.\n\n3. The Last Empire: The Final Days of the Soviet Union by Serhii Plokhy\n\nPlokhy's book is part of a genre which has sprung up in the past ten years or so. It tells the history of the Soviet Union from the end of World War Two up to its final days in 1991, with chapters written by a number of different authors, a series of different views on the same events. In particular, I loved the chapter about Leonid Brezhnev, which put the bloated face I associate with Soviet leaders into the context of the times, so that I could see him as a human being rather than a caricature.\n\n4. James Bond: Casino Royale by Ian Fleming\n\nI have seen every film in the Bond series, and I have read every one of Ian Fleming's Bond novels, including the three which have been published posthumously. I didn't like them, though, and Casino Royale, first published in 1953, is the best of them. But not the most enjoyable. I can't help it. I love Bond, and the villains, and the gadgets, and the violence, but this is a book about a man who wakes up one day and decides to become a spy. It's hard to take seriously.\n\n5. Schuld und Verhängnis by Erich Maria Remarque\n\nI am yet to finish this. Or start it. The translation of this novel, in the original German, is called \"Guilt and Destiny\", and I am holding out for that. I am already struggling to get through it, and I am yet to start the first chapter. But I will, at some point, and I am sure it will be worth it.\n\n6. Silent Souls by Guillermo Martinez\n\nA thriller, or a novel of ideas, about life, death and the nature of evil. I couldn't tell you what it is about, but I liked it. I think. I read it about a year ago, in one sitting, and have forgotten most of it. But the thought of a book which I can't remember which may or may not have been any good, but which I want to read again, has to make it on the list, right?\n\n7. When God Was a Rabbit by Sarah Winman\n\nThis novel is set in England in the 1990s, when life was completely different. It is the story of a girl, Florence, and her relationships with her family, as well as her relationship with her sister. I loved it.\n\n8. Ego by Ben Okri\n\nI am still reading this one. Or I was until I picked up the next one on the list. But it's good. A very good writer, I reckon.\n\n9. The End of Alice by A.M. Homes\n\nThis one is very dark, and it is about a man who kidnaps, and then tortures and kills, a little girl. That's it. It's shocking, but not for that reason. It's a novel about life, in a very different way to When God Was a Rabbit, but very good.\n\n10. Eat My Dust by Amy Ephron\n\nEphron's novel is like a cross between Trainspotting and Bridget Jones's Diary. It is the story of a group of losers, as they grow up together in New York in the 1980s and early 90s, and it is full of wonderful humour and vivid descriptions. A great, great read.\n\nIt would have been very easy to fill the list with books I enjoyed, but there were a few, like Crime and Punishment and Catch-22, which I enjoyed, but did not like. They are great, but I didn't have as much fun reading them as I did the rest of this list. Maybe I'll do a best of the worst in the coming days.\n\nBut these ten were the best, most fun books I have read in the last twelve months. They have made me laugh and cry, and, in some cases, want to write my own.\n\nHappy reading!<|endoftext|>Career Occupational Profile for :\n\nWelder\n\nWelder is very similar to another occupation for which we have a full profile.

But on Wednesday, the company said that it's pulling the plug on this feature and won't add any new downloads.\n\nNetflix said in a statement to Variety that the company is removing the feature as part of an effort to simplify its mobile app. The company cited technical and business reasons for the move, including not having enough content that fits this functionality.\n\n\"We know some members found this feature useful, but we believe it's better to focus on efforts that bring more value to the majority of our members,\" a Netflix spokesperson said. \"Therefore, starting on January 13th, Netflix will no longer support downloading of movies and TV shows. We apologize for any inconvenience.\"\n\nNetflix said that the feature will be removed from the service as of January 14.\n\nNetflix began testing the download feature on Android in 2013 and on iOS the following year. Netflix was joined by Amazon Video, which also started testing the feature on iOS in 2015. At the time, Netflix had a limited catalog of shows and movies that were available for offline viewing.\n\nBut with this change, Netflix is removing a feature that's increasingly become less necessary. Both Netflix and Amazon Video have since added support for offline playback on select smartphones and tablets. Amazon has also added support for offline playback on smart TVs and game consoles.<|endoftext|>Share this article on LinkedIn Email\n\nBritish driver Dan Cammish scored a dominant victory in the Formula Ford Festival finale to take his second successive crown.\n\nCammish took a lights-to-flag victory in the Walter Hayes Trophy, beating Red Bull Junior driver Dan Ticktum by 14.9 seconds.\n\nManuel Maldonado was third for the second year in a row.\n\nCammish, who was the last man on the grid, said he was initially surprised by the pace of the pole-sitting TRS Arden car of Neil Maclennan and spun at Paddock Hill Bend in the opening lap.\n\n\"It was a really fun race,\" he said.\n\n\"I was a bit surprised to see Neil at the front because I thought I was a bit quicker than him.\n\n\"I lost a position at Paddock, went back round the outside and then pulled it back at Druids.\n\n\"It was tricky to build a gap because the conditions were changing a lot.\n\n\"It's a dream come true.

This post is inspired by a conversation I had with a friend on the phone the other day.\n\nI know, I know, how could a conversation with a close friend turn into a post? Well, since we are \"advanced\" practitioners, we were of course talking about whether and when it is appropriate to have an orgasm in Tantric lovemaking.\n\nTantric sexuality is a broad and beautiful topic and orgasm is just one of many important aspects of our sexuality. However, it is a fascinating question. If we look at this through the lens of the \"yoga of sex\", Tantric sex is about the union of our energy body and our physical body. Orgasm, by definition, is the peak of the energy flow of the energy body. So what happens in our spiritual quest when we orgasm?\n\nNow, one of the most important aspects of Tantric sex is that we are grounded, embodied beings. If we are flying in the clouds (more on that another time), we are not having Tantric sex.\n\nSo here is what I said.\n\nIf you can stay grounded and embodied during orgasm, then have one. Have multiple if you like. There is nothing wrong with that. However, many of us who are engaged in this path have orgasms that take us out of our bodies. For some of us, orgasm can make us feel ungrounded or floaty for a while.\n\nThat is because when we orgasm we are in a sort of trance state and we go somewhere. It is often very pleasant. Orgasm is very like meditation for some of us. So why not use that wonderful state to explore our inner worlds?\n\nIf we can stay grounded while we have an orgasm, then let it take us wherever it will. Maybe you'll experience a spontaneous mystical vision. Maybe you'll have a profound insight about something you've been struggling with. Or maybe you'll just drift off into a peaceful slumber. It's up to you.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of people who do not get grounded when they orgasm. They lose connection with their bodies and then have no reference point to ground themselves. Instead, they go into trance. Sometimes they drift into some pretty weird places.\n\nIf you find yourself being ungrounded and spaced out after an orgasm, then don't do it. Wait for the grounding to come before you have another one. If you do this regularly, you will eventually find yourself grounded during orgasm.\n\nLike anything, Tantric sex is something that we must learn, practice and cultivate. It is not an easy thing to do and it takes time to learn and develop.\n\nAnd so, as always, when it comes to sex, we have a choice. We can live our lives with a little bit of pleasure on the side. Or we can choose to change our lives in big ways.\n\nBut the choice is always ours.\n\nPhoto Credit: Michael Dorausch<|endoftext|>St. John's\n\nIf you're shopping for an engagement ring in St. John's, why not visit the city's only Diamond Centre.\n"
"the history of research into alcohol and public health\n\nThis is the story of our evolution from an era when the consumption of alcoholic beverages was considered a necessary part of everyday life, when consumption of alcohol was defined as the cause of any disorder, and when medical researchers were equated with clergy. It has been estimated that as much as 6.2% of all deaths in England and Wales in 1830 were directly attributable to alcohol. The Lancet reported the fact with alarm, while other medical commentators thought it was more important to look at the figure as an argument in favour of temperance. An early public health specialist, Cuthbert William Johnson (1808-1865), proclaimed, ‘Liquor drinking is therefore the bane of society. There is scarcely any evil which it does not bring with it. It has destroyed families, broken up communities, and debauched whole nations.’ This view was a result of the general attitude of the time that believed that ‘the amount of disease and premature death associated with alcohol was so large as to prevent the realisation of a net benefit to society of the use of alcohol’.1\n\nPublic health as a profession is not that old, and by the middle of the 19th century there were few places in the world where a community health-related practitioner existed. Public health practice began to develop in the mid-19th century, as the incidence of epidemic and endemic disease began to fall and life expectancy began to rise. Advances in science also played a part in the growth of public health, and public health practice benefited from the science of statistics, the germ theory of disease and the concept of causation, along with new concepts such as asepsis and quarantine. These events and ideas became the foundation of public health practice and led to a general change in the perception of alcohol.1\n\nThe role of public health\n\nThe role of public health practice today is to provide leadership in the protection of and promotion of the health of the public. The traditional public health role in relation to alcohol is concerned with providing leadership in the protection of the health of the community from the harms caused by alcohol abuse and in promoting the health and social well-being of individuals and communities.1\n\nThe public health response to alcohol is more extensive and complex today than it has ever been.2 It involves the regulation of the production, distribution, sales, marketing, consumption and consumption consequences of alcoholic beverages; the study of the effect of these alcohol-related actions on the health and well-being of individuals and the community, and the communication of the findings and the results of the actions taken to the general public and to those involved in public policy development. The public health response to alcohol also involves the response of the health profession to alcohol and the research required to provide evidence that can be used to support and develop public policy and practice in the area of alcohol-related harm.\n\nThe concept of alcohol as a drug\n\nBefore the mid-19th century, alcohol was not considered a drug. It was part of everyday life and the consumption of alcohol was defined as the cause of any disorder.1 It is a testament to the role of public health in the development of modern society that by 1900 the consumption of alcohol was no longer defined as a cause of any disorder. It had been transformed from a medicinal agent to a socially maligned drug.\n\nThere is a lesson in the history of research into alcohol and public health. It illustrates how changes in medical understanding of a disorder and the development of public health policy and practice have led to changes in our approach to research and our role in public health.\n\nIf the growth of public health practice is to continue to progress, it is essential that the role of public health research is fully recognised. If we are to remain relevant in the 21st century, we need to fully embrace the opportunities that come with being a public health professional and the part we can play in contributing to the solution of some of the major public health challenges that face our communities and our society today.\n\nUse of the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nWhen alcohol was identified as a cause of harm in the mid-19th century, a systematic method of recording and collecting data on the nature and extent of alcohol-related harm began to develop.1 The scale for recording the extent of alcohol-related harm began as a rough and ready method for describing the nature and extent of the problems related to alcohol use. It is now recognised as a systematic and scientifically robust scale for describing the nature and extent of alcohol-related harm.3\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a systematic review of the existing studies of alcohol-related harm. A key outcome of this work was the development of the alcohol-related harm scale. The scale was developed to improve the accuracy of alcohol-related harm estimates and to standardise the measurement of the extent of alcohol-related harm within and between studies. It was developed to be used with both general population samples and samples from groups that are specifically at high risk of alcohol-related harm.3 The scale is widely used and the work undertaken in the development of the scale has provided important lessons in the development of scales for measuring alcohol-related harm. These lessons are directly relevant to our research in public health.\n\nThe development of the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nThe alcohol-related harm scale was developed to assist in the measurement of the various aspects of alcohol-related harm. The scale is based on the impact of alcohol on health and social consequences. It is designed to measure the adverse effects of alcohol consumption on the health of individuals, families, communities and societies.3 The scale uses a 4-point categorical scale to rate the severity of alcohol-related harm, which is expressed as follows:\n\n‘(a) the individual is mildly dependent on alcohol or is a heavy drinker with mild problems related to alcohol;\n\n(b) the individual is moderately dependent on alcohol or is a heavy drinker with moderate problems related to alcohol;\n\n(c) the individual is seriously dependent on alcohol or is a heavy drinker with serious problems related to alcohol;\n\n(d) the individual is in a state of complete dependence on alcohol’.3\n\nThis scale is applicable to both general population samples and samples from groups that are at high risk of alcohol-related harm. The scale is also applicable to the estimation of alcohol-related harm in both past and present populations. The data can be compared to other data and trends in alcohol-related harm identified, thus improving the accuracy of estimates of the prevalence of alcohol-related harm in a community or group of people. It has been shown that the alcohol-related harm scale can be used to estimate alcohol-related harm in a wide range of countries and cultures, across the life course, in groups at risk and among the general population.3\n\nThe utility of the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nThe most widely used scale for the measurement of alcohol-related harm is the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).4 This scale was developed in 1991. It was designed to be administered by non-professional interviewers and consists of 10 questions related to alcohol consumption. It is the most widely used scale in screening people for alcohol-related harm in general population surveys. However, it was not designed to measure the adverse effects of alcohol consumption on health and social consequences. The scale is of particular use in people who are drinking at or below the lower risk drinking levels recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).5 It has been estimated that, because of the AUDIT’s sensitivity to detection of the adverse effects of low levels of consumption of alcohol, the AUDIT may overestimate the level of alcohol-related harm in the population.4\n\nThe alcohol-related harm scale was developed in response to the problem of measurement of the adverse effects of alcohol consumption on health and social consequences.3 The development of the scale was based on a series of detailed and extensive reviews of studies that have measured the impact of alcohol consumption on a range of health, social and economic outcomes.3 The initial evidence of this review was collated in a summary measure of the total effects of alcohol consumption on health and social consequences. It was found that a broad-based measure of the impact of alcohol consumption on health and social consequences was able to significantly improve the predictive power of a wide range of health and social indicators of alcohol-related harm.3 This led to the development of the alcohol-related harm scale.\n\nThe alcohol-related harm scale was developed to help researchers identify the relationship between drinking and a range of health, social and economic outcomes. It has also been designed to improve the comparability of the measurement of alcohol-related harm between studies.3\n\nThe questions in the alcohol-related harm scale were developed on the basis of the evidence of the effects of alcohol consumption on a wide range of health, social and economic outcomes.3 The questions relate to alcohol use that falls within a range of standard consumption levels. The alcohol-related harm scale allows for the measurement of adverse effects of both low-level and high-level consumption of alcohol, and enables both short-term and long-term effects to be measured. The use of the alcohol-related harm scale overcomes the difficulties associated with measuring the impact of both low-level and high-level consumption of alcohol.3\n\nThe usefulness of the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nThe evidence for the usefulness of the alcohol-related harm scale is summarised in Table 1. This includes a number of studies in different countries and cultures, including studies that were conducted in Australia,6-8 Canada,9-11 Ireland,12 New Zealand13 and the United States of America.14\n\nResearch using the alcohol-related harm scale\n\nThe effectiveness of alcohol control policies and programmes can be measured by their impact on the prevalence of alcohol-related"
"Nadat de terroristische aanslag op Charlie Hebdo ons land achtervolgde, kwam de gemoedelijkheid van het Franse volk boven. Het was een beweging van solidariteit en kameraadschap, zo verwoordde de Franse president, Emmanuel Macron, het verschijnsel. ‘Nous sommes unis.’ Er is geen verdere vermelding van een maatschappelijke discussie over de vraag hoe gevaarlijk en ondemocratisch de islam is.\n\nDe mislukte poging om de rechtsstaat te bestrijden is een serieus aanval op onze democratische orde en een inbreuk op de rechten en vrijheden van ons volk. De aanslag op Charlie Hebdo was in 2014 niet het eerste, maar wel het laatste stadium van een oprukkende islamisering van Frankrijk, zoals later is gebleken. De zoveelste aanslag op een moskee, de toename van het aantal nieuwe moskeeën en de toestroom van het aantal nieuwe vluchtelingen uit Noord-Afrika en het Midden-Oosten zijn de beste illustraties van dit proces. Een sterk gegronde angst voor de islamisering, samen met een aantal betogen van Geert Wilders in het parlement, hebben geleid tot een onzekerheid die de vrijheid van de mens ondermijnt en die tot nieuwe ineenstorting van de samenleving kan leiden.\n\nDe invoering van het kiesrecht voor vrouwen en een algemeen en universeel stemrecht waren de hoogtepunten van de politieke en sociale beweging in de jaren 70, die een wervelwind van democratische groei teweegbracht. De jonge generatie is vandaag, in tegenstelling tot haar voorgangers, onwetend van de grondslag van die beweging. Onder invloed van een aantal elementen in de wetenschap en de media is de democratie voor hen iets dat zich vanzelf verwijdt. Men vraagt zich bij deze ‘onwetendheid’ niet af of men hiermee geen voorwaarde van de democratie ontkent.\n\nDe realiteit van de dag is een andere dan die van voorheen. De democratische rechten en de vrijheid van de mens zijn gevaarvol beïnvloed door het islamistische gevaar. Het vermoeden dat islam en democratie niet samen gaan, staat buiten kijf. Een islamitische staat en een islamitische regering kunnen niet democratisch zijn.\n\nDe islam is een ideologie waarin de wetten van de Schrift en van de profeet boven de wetten van de natie en van de staat geplaatst worden. De islam is geen democratische geloofsgemeenschap. De islamistische ideologie van de verovering van de wereld en van de onderwerping van alle volken is inherent aan de islam. De islam beweegt zich niet alleen in het leven van de moslims, maar beweegt zich door heel de samenleving, vanaf het niveau van de samenleving en van de natie, tot en met het niveau van de natie en van de staat, en van daaruit tot het niveau van de internationale gemeenschap.\n\nDe islam vraagt om verdraagzaamheid en geweld, dat wil zeggen dat hij zich openstaat voor andere geloofsgemeenschappen, maar voor zover zij bereid zijn om zich te laten onderwerpen en te vernietigen. Dit zijn de gedragingen van het islamitische gevaar. Een islamitische staat of een islamitische regering kan een individuele moslim alleen accepteren en beschermen zolang hij zich aanpast aan de wetten van de staat. Wanneer hij dat niet doet, wordt hij automatisch als vijand beschouwd.\n\nVandaag, na driehonderd jaar, moeten we het over de islam hebben. Wij moeten de vrijheid van de mens een hogere prioriteit geven dan die van de moslim. Dit zal een nieuwe mens, een nieuwe samenleving en een nieuwe politiek betekenen. Een mens die weet waarom hij is en waar hij heen wil. En we mogen niet vergeten dat de islam in Europa en in de wereld een nieuwe toekomst in gang zet. Dit is een grote kans voor ons.\n\nIk ben ervan overtuigd dat we geen alternatieve godsdiensten kunnen toestaan, of welke andere waarden dan ook, in de Europese samenleving. Dit zou de ondergang van Europa zijn. Ik stel voor om het kiesrecht voor vrouwen en een algemeen en universeel stemrecht af te schaffen. Daarmee creëren we een samenleving van jongeren die worden verwekt door één enkele vader, die een eigen godsdienst, een eigen taal, een eigen cultuur en een eigen historie hebben.\n\nDe Arabische stammen in het noorden en het zuiden, de taal van de profeet, een homogene natie en een heilige oorlog.\n\nDe Islam kwam in zuidelijke richting over de Pyreneeën in Spanje. Dat is waarom de koning en de koningin van Spanje vandaag Arabieren zijn. Ze kwamen niet uit Frankrijk, zoals de meeste historici willen, maar kwamen vanuit Spanje. De Franse Revolutionaire Republiek was het resultaat van het werk van de islam. Alle heilige oorlogen, vanaf de verovering van Spanje, werden tot stand gebracht door de islam. Die eerste oorlogen waren echter omringd door krachten die ongelijk waren aan de islam. De oorlog die een directe invloed had op de geboorte van de Franse Revolutie, was de Zuidelijke Islamitische Golfoorlog.\n\nHet islamitische gevaar kan dus niet buiten de oorlogen in Europa worden begrepen. Een nieuwe oorlog begint altijd met de islam. Als het gaat om het islamitische gevaar, kunnen we er niet omheen. We kunnen het niet verzwijgen. De enige weg is de confrontatie. Er bestaat geen gematigde islam. De islam is niet geschikt voor Europa. En wat voor Europa wél geschikt is, is Europa niet voor de islam.\n\nDe islam is gevaarlijk voor Europa en voor alle beschaafde landen in de wereld. De islamisering van Europa is een doel dat we moeten bereiken. Daarom kunnen we het niet toestaan dat de islam een volwaardige aanspraak doet op onze democratische rechten en onze vrijheden. De weigering om het probleem van de islam op te lossen is een ontkenning van de democratie. De democratie is onze oplossing, net zoals de oorlogen ons probleem waren.\n\nDe laatste honderd jaar zijn we de islamitische agressie over ons heen gekomen. De komst van de o"

A substantial ruin with attractive internal features, it was established in 1787.\n\n<|endoftext|>Algyrosaurus\n\nAlgyrosaurus is a genus of tritylodontoid cynodonts. The type species \"A. kokartei\" is from the Upper Triassic (Norian stage) of eastern Austria, and was named in 2000.\n\n\"Algyrosaurus\" is known from an almost complete postcranial skeleton and from partial skulls. Its body was long. It was a small animal and, as a typical tritylodont, \"Algyrosaurus\" had reduced postcanines and a strongly reduced skull.\n\n\"Algyrosaurus\" was described in 2000 on the basis of specimen no. HG 199/75, a skeleton lacking the skull but otherwise almost complete. Additional specimens were named in 2004 and 2007, including a partial skull and specimen EHN 1869.\n\nAs the specimen HG 199/75 was lost, only its redescription remains. It can be distinguished from its close relative \"Dvinia\", which it is more similar to, by its relatively larger size, more robust vertebrae, more sloping ilium, and more pointed humerus. The type species \"A. kokartei\" was named after the collector of the holotype, Serguey Kokartsev.\n\nThe holotype of \"Algyrosaurus kokartei\" was found in a locality near Aich, which is part of the Austrian Triassic Basin, and is dated to the Norian stage, about 210 million years ago. \"Algyrosaurus\" was found in deposits that represent an island habitat, most likely a coastal area with shallow, calcareous lagoons. Its distribution probably was limited to this area.\n\nSeveral specimens, mostly partial skeletons, were found in Kazakhstan during the 1970s and 1980s in the Dzhanbulak Basin, which is part of the Kazakhstan depression. The locality was dated to the late Norian or Rhaetian stages of the Late Triassic. Among the material were vertebrae, ribs, partial limbs, and a skull. Two specimens, a postcranial skeleton and the skull, were in 2006 referred to \"Algyrosaurus\". The specimens were described as \"Algyrosaurus\" cf. \"kokartei\". They can be distinguished from the Austrian specimens by a wider pelvic girdle and the overall proportions of the body.\n\n\"Algyrosaurus\" is a tritylodont, one of the best known members of this group of herbivorous cynodonts. Tritylodonts first appeared during the Carnian and diversified during the Norian, becoming extinct at the end of the Rhaetian stage of the Triassic. Most tritylodonts were rather small animals, with a length of around . \"Algyrosaurus\" was a member of the subfamily Tritylodontinae, which includes genera such as \"Tritylodon\" and \"Dvinia\".\n\n\"Algyrosaurus\" shares a number of synapomorphies with \"Dvinia\", which indicates that the two genera form a clade. Among these synapomorphies are a convex top of the dentary bone, a concave back margin, and a narrower symphysis. This clade, the subfamily Dviniinae, is defined as all tritylodonts closer to \"Dvinia\" than to \"Tritylodon\". The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic relationships of \"Algyrosaurus\" from Müller \"et al.\" (2011):\n\nSpecimen EHN 1869 was found with the skull of a juvenile specimen, specimen EHN 1870, which was found inside it.

The Karkeh River is the site of the Karkeh National Park.\n\nThe word \"Karkheh\" means \"crumbling\" in Persian, and is often translated as the \"Loose River\" or \"the Crumbling River.\"\n\nThe river is the site of the first large scale water diversion and irrigation system in the world, constructed by the ancient Persians around 500 B.C.. The system used a complex network of canals in order to divert the water from the Karkheh River into a man made river, known as the Shaft-Well. The river was used to flood a series of fields, and was used to channel water into the Shaft-Well for a second flooding. This system allowed for a large area of fertile land to be watered by the otherwise small river.\n\nHistorically, the river is also known as the Choaspes, Chrysorrhoas, and Jaxartes.\n\n<|endoftext|>Bill Matthews (Australian politician)\n\nWilliam Norman Joseph \"Bill\" Matthews (28 October 1923 – 18 October 1995) was an Australian politician.\n\nBorn in Longreach, Queensland, he was educated at the Christian Brothers College, Townsville and at the Royal Military College, Duntroon.

"Florence Turner\n\nFlorence Turner (September 2, 1884 – March 13, 1958) was an American actress, stage manager, and manager. She was active on stage from 1910 to 1958. She began her stage career as a teenager in a vaudeville act with her sisters, the Turners, as \"The Four Sisters Turner.\" Turner managed the Broadway production of \"The Little Show\" for eight years. She married actor Albert Smith, who later became known as Jean Harlow's stepfather. Turner later worked as Harlow's personal manager and was responsible for organizing Harlow's funeral.\n\nFlorence Louise Turner was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Emma Seib Turner, an actress, and Franklin G. Turner, a singing and dancing instructor. Florence and her four sisters performed as the Turners, a vaudeville act in which each sister sang or danced while the others supported her. The sisters became one of the most popular acts of their era. In 1910, the Turners moved to Broadway, where they appeared in \"Going Up\" with Florence in the leading role. She next appeared in \"The Silver Slipper\" in 1912. Turner continued to perform with her sisters as a chorus girl in a series of Broadway shows.\n\nIn 1922, Turner made her New York stage manager debut in \"The Blue Flame\", a musical with a book by Zona Gale and Edmund Goulding. The show was a failure and closed after 15 performances. She continued to work as a stage manager and assistant stage manager on Broadway shows. Turner became the stage manager of \"The Little Show\", a successful revue that ran from 1925 to 1928. She then took over as the stage manager for \"The Garrick Gaieties\", a musical revue that ran from 1928 to 1930. She also worked as stage manager for \"The Garrick Gaieties\" national tour.\n\nTurner's management of \"The Garrick Gaieties\" was largely responsible for its success, and the show's producer Arthur Hammerstein considered Turner for the same position on \"The Desert Song\" in 1931. The show's original stage manager had died, and the producer offered the position to Turner, but she was unable to accept it because she was already committed to managing \"The Little Show\". When \"The Little Show\" closed in 1931, Turner became the manager of \"The Desert Song\". She organized the production and the touring company that followed the show. She managed the national tour of the show from 1933 to 1935. She left the show in 1935 to become a personal manager for movie star Jean Harlow, who was one of Turner's clients.\n\nTurner was responsible for organizing Harlow's funeral after she died suddenly of uremic poisoning on June 7, 1937. She was unable to attend the funeral, as she was recovering from an appendectomy in a Hollywood hospital. Turner supervised the production of \"The Jean Harlow Story\", a biographical film that told Harlow's story in her own words and in flashbacks. The film was originally supposed to star Harlow, but she was replaced by Jane Wyman after Harlow's death. In March 1942, Turner worked with 20th Century Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck to help Harlow's widower, actor William Powell, recover from the accidental drowning of his son.\n\nTurner retired from the theater in 1945 after more than 30 years as a stage manager. She worked as a freelance manager on behalf of her clients. She continued to work as Harlow's personal manager, and in 1950, Turner traveled to England to work with Harlow's London agent, Billy Rose.\n\nTurner married actor Albert Smith, who was later known as Jean Harlow's stepfather, in 1912. They were separated in 1917. In 1923, she began an affair with dancer Milt Kahn.\n\nTurner died on March 13, 1958, in New York City. She was 64 years old. Her death was unexpected, and an autopsy showed that she died of myocardial infarction.\n\n<|endoftext|>Sailing at the 2015 Pan American Games – Snipe\n\nThe Snipe competition of the Sailing events at the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto was held from July 12 to July 19 at the Royal Canadian Yacht Club.\n\nPoints were assigned based on the finishing position in each race (1 for first, 2 for second, etc.). The points were totaled from the top 9 results of the first 10 races, with lower totals being better. If a sailor was disqualified or did not complete the race, 17 points were assigned for that race (as there were 16 sailors in this competition). The top 5 sailors at that point competed in the final race, with placings counting double for final score. The sailor with the lowest total score won.\n\nRace M is the medal race.\n\n<|endoftext|>2010 Rugby League Four Nations\n\nThe 2010 Rugby League Four Nations tournament was played in Australia and New Zealand between 26 October and 6 November 2010.

The competition consisted of Australia, England, New Zealand and a team representing the rest of the world. The final was won by New Zealand who defeated Australia 22-18.\n\nA Four Nations match was played as the opening game of the 2010 season between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 13 February. The match was played with the rules and conditions of a test match rather than as an exhibition match.\n\nThe NRL Auckland Nines were held over a weekend during February as a lead-up to the Four Nations, with four of the tournament's competing teams (England, Australia, New Zealand and the Rugby League World Cup) playing three games each. Each game was nine minutes shorter than a regular game.\n\nEngland, New Zealand and the world team played a one-off test match against Australia, New Zealand and England respectively on 6, 13 and 20 October at Wembley Stadium, the Etihad Stadium and Headingley Stadium in England. Australia hosted the final of the tournament on 6 November at the Elland Road Stadium, the home of English team Leeds.

It ran on a number of home computer systems in the early to mid-1980s, and has been compared to other online services such as The Source and Compunet. It ceased operation in 1986, but spawned a number of related projects.\n\nAndromeda was written by Steve Davies, a computer enthusiast and owner of Andromeda Computing. Andromeda operated in the UK from 1982 to 1986, initially running on the ZX Spectrum and later the ZX Spectrum +2. It was also available for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family, Acorn Atom, BBC Micro, MSX and Oric-1. As of mid-1985, Andromeda had over 1000 members and 30,000 players.\n\nAndromeda was unusual at the time in that it was a dial-up service, with the modem connected to a telephone line. The software itself, which ran from the floppy disk, could be loaded from the keyboard or a tape recorder. Users would call a single telephone number (the user id) which was connected to the Andromeda server and then select the appropriate server on which to run the game or application. Users could then enter their own user id and password and, if allowed, interact with the application.\n\nA later version of Andromeda allowed a dedicated home computer to be connected to the Andromeda system and access games, and transfer data between the home computer and the Andromeda server. The home computer ran a front-end program which was loaded from the floppy disk and displayed on the television or monitor, and allowed access to the Andromeda server.\n\nAlthough Andromeda was primarily a gaming system, it also ran a number of business applications, such as customer databases and word processing, which allowed users to save their work to the Andromeda server. Users could then return to their work later.\n\nThe Andromeda Computing office was also a shop, selling the home computer hardware and software required to use the system, as well as peripheral equipment such as the dedicated Andromeda Link, and a range of hardware to connect these computers to the network.\n\nA number of \"official\" Andromeda games and applications were developed for the system, and many independent and homemade applications were also available. Andromeda's commercial software range included the Bitz product range of games, distributed by Andromeda in cassette tape format. In addition to the commercial games, a number of freeware games and applications were available, including arcade conversions, puzzle games and games in the adventure genre.\n\nDuring its operation, Andromeda Computing Ltd had a well-established network of developers, users and associated businesses. An internal bulletin board system allowed members of the public to join the system. This included an area for users to exchange software and files with each other, and the facility to submit user-written software and applications for distribution.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Blood Brothers (1987 film)\n\nBlood Brothers is a 1987 American-Australian-British action drama film directed by John Guillermin and based on the play \"Brothers\" by Jim Cartwright.

She has won two Academy Awards, eight Golden Globes, twenty Screen Actors Guild Awards, three BAFTAs, five British Academy Film Awards, and has received 30 Oscar nominations, more than any other actor. She is also one of the few performers to have won three of the four major American entertainment awards (EGOT). On November 12, 2012, Streep was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\nWhat is Meryl Streep Famous for? Streep is famous for her versatility and is widely considered to be one of the best actresses of her generation. Richard Corliss, a writer for Time magazine, stated that “Streep is “America’s greatest actress”, while Tanya Gold of The Guardian stated that she is “possibly the greatest actress of her generation”, an opinion shared by author and film historian Leonard Maltin. The website Movies.com stated that “Streep is arguably the most accomplished actor of her generation.” Peter Travers of Rolling Stone is in complete agreement, stating that Streep is “the greatest actress of her generation, and one of the greatest of all time.” Michael Schulman of Vanity Fair has described Streep as a “national treasure.” Her acclaimed performances in Sophie’s Choice, Out of Africa, and The Iron Lady have won her the Academy Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, as well as numerous critics’ awards. She was also nominated for Academy Awards for her work in The Deer Hunter, Kramer vs. Kramer, Silkwood, and Adaptation. The New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics, and the London Film Critics’ Circle have also honored her work. In 2005, Streep was honored by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures with the “Class of ’56 Award” for her “enduring contribution to the art of the screen.” In 2006, she received the AFI Life Achievement Award in recognition of her “outstanding contribution to America’s cinematic heritage.” In 2007, she was honored by the Kennedy Center Honors, where she was also billed as “one of the world’s foremost theatre actresses”, and in 2010 she was awarded the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award for “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment”. In 2013, she was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, with a BAFTA Fellowship Award, which is the highest honour that the British Film Academy can give a filmmaker.\n\nWhat is Meryl Streep Famous for Doing? Streep is known for starring in films such as Silkwood, Sophie’s Choice, Out of Africa, The Iron Lady, A Cry in the Dark, The French Lieutenant’s Woman, Death Becomes Her, The Bridges of Madison County, One Fine Day, It’s Complicated, Hope Springs, Julie & Julia, It’s Kind of a Funny Story, August: Osage County, and The Giver. She is also known for playing a wide variety of real-life characters, ranging from composers (Roxanne, Silkwood, The Iron Lady) to AIDS activists (The Normal Heart) to a politician (The Manchurian Candidate).\n\nWhat is Meryl Streep Famous for Saying? “I don’t know where I get my work ethic. I have a sense that it is like walking a tightrope and that if I fall off I am going to be injured. If I don’t work hard, I’m going to miss something.” “It’s very simple to me. You know, the closer you get to the bone, the truer it is. The closer you get to the edge, the more it is about the character.” “I think of myself as the person who has no qualities. You know, because I play real people. I play very private people who are in pain. You can’t be big enough for that.” “I feel like my intelligence is my most important asset. That and my curiosity.” “I don’t take it on myself to decide what people should find attractive and what they shouldn’t. I don’t think that’s my right.” “I have a hunger for being alive, for being myself. I have a hunger for the things I want.” “It’s important to do things in your life that are hard. If it’s easy, it’s not as much fun.” “It’s good to have a relationship where there’s love and respect, and it’s rare to have that and it’s rare to have that without children. I wouldn’t have had the life I have without the children.”\n\nWhat is Meryl Streep Famous for Wearing? Streep has become known for her “iconic” style, in particular her “enviable” shoe collection. The first pair she owned were her “Jimmy Choo red satin sandals”, which she credits with transforming her into an actress, though she now finds them to be “too flashy” for her. She has also mentioned that she collects the footwear of the people she plays. According to Out Magazine, the “interchangeable, inimitable, impossible-to-replicate outfits Meryl Streep wears in her various films and awards shows is, hands down, the most iconic fashion trend of the past three decades.” Streep’s dresses and gowns are most often created by Italian designers such as Valentino, Prada, Armani, and Dolce & Gabbana, but she also uses Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, Donna Karan, Givenchy, Versace, Lanvin, Christian Dior, Oscar de la Renta, and Escada. Her first Oscar dress was an Armani gown that cost $10,000 and her first Golden Globe dress was a dress by Valentino, who later designed the dress she wore to her second Oscar ceremony. At the 2011 Golden Globe Awards, she wore a dress by Australian designer Alex Perry.\n\nWhat is Meryl Streep Famous for Saying About Politics? Streep was an active supporter of the Presidential campaign of Barack Obama and also endorsed Howard Dean for the 2004 Presidential election. After Obama’s inauguration, she was invited to join the President and First Lady for the weekend in Aspen, Colorado. In April 2008, Streep and Meryl Streep attended the state funeral of former First Lady of the United States Nancy Reagan. In March 2011, Streep delivered a speech at the 2011 Women’s Media Awards, in which she argued that men’s disdain for the “feminine” contributed to a lack of communication between men and women, which she believes undermines “equality in the workplace.” She also stated that the dominance of men in positions of political power, combined with their lack of ability to communicate effectively, has led to a government “that is shut down, that cannot listen, that can’t talk.” She criticized the Republican Party, accusing it of focusing on money, the size of the federal deficit, and Medicare cuts “while ignoring the country’s infrastructure, educational system and social fabric.” She has also said that if she could run for office, she would be a “socialist.” Streep also supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, calling it “a completely necessary and long-overdue debate about the obscene level of inequality in this country.” In October 2011, Streep, along with other artists and cultural leaders, signed an open letter condemning the incarceration of the director and screenwriter Oleg Sentsov. In 2015, Streep spoke in favor of the nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 world powers, calling it “brave and radical”. In May 2016, Streep, an “ardent liberal”, praised President Barack Obama for his “grace” in office and for the work he had done “against the many atrocities” of the Trump administration. She stated that while she had previously remained silent about politics for the sake of her “career and safety”, the country’s current political situation had forced her to break her silence. She said, “We need a strong, sane, courageous leader to save our country and our world, and I’m thrilled to say that leader is finally here.”\n\nWhat is Meryl Streep Famous for Believing? Streep has supported Women in Film, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advocating for and improving the work conditions of women in the film industry. In 2010, Streep and seven other female actors were honored by Women in Film with the Crystal Award for excellence in film.\n\nWhat is Meryl Streep Famous for Saying About Love? “Well, I think love has a lot to do with how you show up in your relationships, as well as what your expectations are. Because I feel like, without expectations, you’re open to anything, which is really interesting.” “Love is more important than anything. More important than ambition, more important than money, more important than what you do. I mean"

"The specter of moral disapproval of a certain vice is less fraught with consequences than is the issue of personal discomfort with that same vice.\n\nStill, I am gratified that The Atlantic magazine has come out with a strong opinion piece in support of legalizing prostitution.\n\nTo be sure, in his article, Conor Friedersdorf, author of \"The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law,\" looks at some of the arguments on both sides of the issue of making prostitution legal.\n\nAfter weighing the arguments, he concludes: \"There are good reasons to treat prostitution as an issue of vice, in which we discourage the practice of selling sex, rather than as an issue of crime, in which we punish the purchasers and sellers of sex. But when we do, we ignore the primary problem with a system that bans commercial sex while tolerating the market for sexual acts.\"\n\nHe then explains what I believe is the case: \"Once the government decides that commercial sex acts are inherently immoral, the law of demand and supply ensures that many more will participate in the market for sex: Clients will be willing to pay more for the services of illegal prostitutes than for legal ones, while sex workers themselves will be willing to take more risks to avoid detection.\"\n\nWe all know that this is true.\n\nFriedersdorf suggests a solution: \"Some sex-worker activists believe that making prostitution legal would actually reduce human trafficking, as the number of voluntary sex workers would go up, leaving fewer willing to be exploited. That may or may not be true, but for me, the more important problem is that if prostitution remains illegal, the violent criminal gangs who traffic in women will always have the advantage in this market, because they can offer an illegal product more cheaply.\"\n\nHe is exactly right about this. In fact, in my experience, once a client gets to know a sex worker he finds a way to avoid the high costs of going to the \"middle man\" by coming directly to the source for a bargain.\n\nWhat about the issue of moral disapproval?\n\nFriedersdorf addresses this, too: \"Prostitution will remain illegal, and so long as it does, many men will seek to buy sex, while women and girls will seek to sell it. There are other factors in play, of course, but on balance, a society that makes it easier for men to seek sexual satisfaction without having to marry or commit to a relationship will always have more sex workers than a society that requires all men to satisfy their sexual desires within marriage. Even for those who believe that marriage and fidelity are morally preferable to promiscuity and infidelity, the numbers speak for themselves. Even with all of the vice-and-crime approach's costs, American society will have more sex workers than if we legalized the market for sex.\"\n\nWhat Friedersdorf is saying is that we can pretend that we have eliminated the demand for commercial sex, but that we have done nothing but push the demand underground. It also has the unintended effect of sending the client to dangerous, seedy places to engage in unsafe sex.\n\n\"A moral vision that allows men to satisfy their sexual needs with women who wish to be paid for their sexual services need not undermine our social norms. It need not violate our social taboos. It need not disrupt our marriages and families. It need not even corrupt our children, if we educate them properly,\" he concludes.\n\nIn short, we can solve a lot of problems if we stop moralizing about prostitution and simply make it legal.<|endoftext|>Just in case you're wondering, that was the hottest day in the 30-year history of the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth.\n\nThe mercury hit 114 degrees in downtown Fort Worth and the average high temperature for July 19 is just 89.5.\n\nNationally, it was the hottest day since July 6, 2013, when the temperature hit 117 in Death Valley, California.\n\n\"I was hoping the season wasn't going to start out like that,\" NWS meteorologist Butch Dye said. \"A low pressure system was passing through the area and the jet stream was far enough north that we had a good shot at some widespread severe weather across North Texas.\"\n\nIn addition to the heat and thunderstorms, Fort Worth also recorded wind gusts that approached 60 mph.\n\nThat helped fuel the fire at Southwest Chute 7 at Alliance Airport.

We've only had it for a couple of weeks, but we've already gotten a lot of use out of it. We wanted it mainly because of the \"swing your baby\" aspect of it (if that makes sense). It has a very high, sturdy seat, and the rest of it is quite high and wide. The seat is very solid. You can have it swinging for a long time with very little effort. It can be very soft, and you can \"rock\" your baby on it, or you can make it more \"swinging\", if that makes sense. You can adjust the ropes easily, which is great, and they're very sturdy, but not hard to adjust. The seat is very wide and deep, and fits my son really well. He's 3 months old and is quite chunky, but he has plenty of room. And the fact that it's wood means that it will last for a very long time. It doesn't look like it's for \"babies\" either. Even though it's simple, it's a very nice looking piece of furniture.<|endoftext|>TAMPA, Fla. -- The Yankees will welcome back a familiar face this weekend when outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury starts in left field Friday against the Mets at Citi Field.\n\nEllsbury, who has been sidelined since Sept. 11 due to a dislocated right shoulder, said he's ready to get back on the field.\n\n\"I'm excited,\" Ellsbury said Wednesday morning. \"Excited to be back, looking forward to it.\"\n\nIn the Yankees' 11-1 win over the Rays on Wednesday night, Ellsbury went 1-for-2 with a walk in his first rehab game with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\n\"It's great to see the ball come off the bat and see the work is paying off,\" Ellsbury said of watching the game on TV. \"I felt great today, so I'm looking forward to doing more of that.\"\n\nEllsbury had been taking grounders at first base, but manager Joe Girardi said he'll return to left field when he returns to the big leagues.\n\nGirardi, however, is uncertain if Ellsbury will take his first major league at-bat of the season Friday night.\n\n\"We'll see. We haven't talked about it yet,\" Girardi said.\n\nEllsbury admitted he's been eager to get back on the field.\n\n\"It was tough, honestly,\" he said of the shoulder injury. \"I'm a competitor. I want to be out there. I want to play, but there was nothing I could do. I was trying to do the best I could, and I was playing hurt, obviously.\"\n\nEllsbury, who won a Gold Glove in 2014, believes he's playing at an All-Star level once again.\n\n\"I felt like I was playing at a pretty good level, at an All-Star level for the first half of the year, for sure,\" he said. \"And obviously, I know what I can do, so that's the goal. To get back to that level.\"\n\nOf course, the Yankees' outfield has changed quite a bit since Ellsbury last played. Aaron Judge was called up on Aug. 3 and became an instant fan favorite, and Tyler Austin, who is currently in the lineup against the Rays, has taken over in left field.\n\n\"I'm just here to help,\" Ellsbury said. \"It's a good young group here. They're playing well. They're playing hard. It's a great group, so I'm just here to help.\"<|endoftext|>Quoted By:\n\nThere are very specific kinds of critiques of liberalism that are given in the context of a conversation that liberals would have.

He was the older brother of fellow outlaws Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. The Barrow Gang was known for two things: their non-confrontational strategy of targeting banks and small towns where they could get away faster, and for the Texas Prison System refusing to disclose where it had incarcerated the men and women who made up its \"most wanted list\". This kept the gang in the news during most of its two-year spree and brought the Barrow Gang to the attention of national celebrity.\n\nBuck Barrow was born to Henry Barrow and Cumie Barrow in Telico, Texas on May 5, 1903.\n\nHe was married to Blanche Barrow and had two children, Nell and F.P. Barrow, Jr. He was arrested several times and spent a year in prison for burglary, before being released on parole in 1925. After his release, he became a suspect in at least five murders, but was never tried for them.\n\nIn January 1929, he met with Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and W.D. Jones to discuss robbing the Texas State Bank in Arcadia, Louisiana. On January 23, W.D. Jones enlisted the help of his friend Henry Methvin to help the group pull off the robbery. On the afternoon of January 24, the gang, minus Clyde, who had stayed behind to keep watch on Jones's family, waited outside the bank. When the townsfolk began to leave their businesses and head towards the bank for the 5:00 p.m. closing, the gang rode into town. They looted the bank of $2,400 and headed back out of town. However, they were stopped by a police roadblock. A shootout ensued and the police killed W.D. Jones. Clyde, driving Bonnie and Jones's widow, Mary, picked up Buck, Blanche, and Methvin, and they fled back to Texas.\n\nThe gang split up after returning to Texas. Buck, Blanche, and Methvin fled to Kansas City, Missouri, where Buck had a sister. However, his sister refused to help them, and Buck was afraid that his criminal record would prevent him from finding work, so he and Blanche left the state. Buck and Blanche went to St. Paul, Minnesota, where they attempted to rob the bank in South St. Paul on April 3, 1929. Buck entered the bank and robbed it of $2,500. He had trouble getting out of the bank with the money, so he told Blanche to get a cab and get him out. Instead, she drove off with the money. They fled to Chicago, where Buck was finally able to secure work as a mechanic.\n\nThey settled in Litchfield, Illinois and opened a garage. In the early hours of January 16, 1930, Blanche gave birth to their daughter, Bonnie Barrow. Bonnie was born two months premature, and she died two days later. A week later, on January 23, 1930, Blanche was arrested for the South St. Paul robbery. She was convicted and sent to prison in the Minnesota State Reformatory.\n\nIn June 1930, Blanche was paroled from prison, but she was unable to find Buck. She reunited with Clyde in Texas, and the couple married on March 22, 1931. Buck was eventually picked up by the police for the South St. Paul robbery. He was sentenced to serve ten to thirty years in prison at the Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Buck attempted to escape on July 8, 1931, along with three other convicts. They were armed with automatic weapons and intended to take the prison warden hostage and force him to drive them to Mexico. They were unable to take the warden hostage, but did make it to the main gate, where they shot their way out and escaped.\n\nBuck was caught shortly thereafter. He was held at the prison in Lecumberri in Mexico City. However, Mexican authorities later turned Buck over to Texas authorities, who placed him in the Huntsville Prison Farm. He remained there until December 1933, when he was granted parole. Buck then met up with his sister Nell and her husband, Ted Hinton, and Hinton gave Buck a job working on a used car lot.\n\nOn March 24, 1934, Buck and Hinton were having lunch at Hinton's house in Irving, Texas. Buck had brought Bonnie and Clyde to Hinton's house so that Bonnie could meet his wife. Bonnie and Blanche took an instant dislike to each other. Hinton's wife refused to talk to Bonnie, so Blanche got upset. Buck got up and slapped Blanche, which caused her to fall and hit her head on the kitchen stove. Blanche later filed assault charges against Buck, which caused him to flee to Oklahoma to avoid a murder charge.\n\nThe next day, on March 25, 1934, Buck, Blanche, and Bonnie were all in Springfield, Missouri. That night, Bonnie and Buck attended a dance at the Liberty Tavern in town. While they were at the dance, Clyde, Bonnie, and W.D. Jones were robbing the Eastham Prison Farm of $24,000. When they returned to the tavern, Buck and Blanche argued and Blanche left. On the night of March 26, Blanche filed assault charges against Buck, claiming that he had beaten her the night before. The police picked up Buck and placed him under protective custody. However, they let him go at the insistence of the local sheriff, who told Buck to leave the state. Buck then fled to St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nBuck Barrow was killed in the car of Beulah Brash, who was driving south on Highway 71 in Gentry, Arkansas, on June 10, 1934. He was buried in the same cemetery as his sister and his niece in Artesia, New Mexico.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Fascism in Australia\n\nFascism in Australia has had a presence, although a minor one, since the 1920s. Historically, these parties and organisations have espoused an assortment of reactionary, national socialist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist doctrines.\n\nThere has been a small and generally short-lived presence of a range of fascist movements in Australia since the 1920s. The first fascist organisation in Australia was the New Guard. The Guard was formed in 1931 as a militia-styled movement to resist the perceived threat of socialism and communism, and was modelled on the British \"Blue Shirt\" fascist movement. It quickly became a significant force in New South Wales politics, although less so in the other states. At its peak it had about 25,000 members, although by 1935 this had dwindled to 10,000. The Guard continued to operate after the outbreak of World War II, but had largely dissipated by the late 1940s. The only state to have an organised fascist movement during this period was Victoria, where the Victorian Fascist Movement was formed in the 1930s. The Movement held seats in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1935 and 1943.\n\nAfter World War II, only two fascist organisations existed in Australia: the British Empire Union and the League of Rights. Both of these organisations were founded in the 1940s and opposed to the spread of communism. A number of other organisations, including the Australian Nationalist Movement, formed in the 1970s, but never achieved significant memberships.\n\nAustralian involvement in World War I saw the emergence of a sense of national identity. This was assisted by the heavy losses of the war and the suffering endured by the Australian people. However, World War I also saw a significant increase in support for the Labor Party, due in part to the prominence of the conscription debate. This led to a significant defeat of the conservative non-Labor forces in the 1917 election, and was a catalyst for the formation of the Nationalist Party in 1917 by former Labor Party members who opposed conscription.\n\nThe Nationalist Party government was a significant force in Australian politics during the 1920s. Although initially there was strong support for the Nationalist Party, this was followed by a split within the party in 1921, which led to the creation of the Country Party. The Country Party attracted some conservatives who opposed the progressive attitudes of the Nationalist government. The establishment of the Country Party was significant, as it represented a conservative block of votes that could not be ignored.\n\nThe formation of the Country Party led to the perception that the non-Labor side of politics was becoming fragmented. This was exacerbated by the replacement of the Nationalist Party leader, former Prime Minister Billy Hughes, by Stanley Bruce in 1923. Hughes' replacement of the Prime Minister is viewed as a pivotal moment in Australian politics, and is characterised as a shift from the leadership style of a \"traditional conservative\" to that of a \"modern conservative\". Hughes' tenure as Prime Minister was highly controversial and contributed to the instability of the non-Labor side of politics.\n\nWith the formation of the Country Party, the Nationalist Party became increasingly aligned with business and middle class interests, and was viewed as \"the party of the squatters\". The perception of this led to the creation of the New Guard in 1931, which was modelled on the British \"Blue Shirt\" fascist movement. It espoused many of the views of the earlier Old Guard, which had been formed by disgruntled"
"The Nabisco factory is a 12-acre complex that includes a one-million-square-foot cookie-making facility. There are 55 ovens and a 2.5-million-pound flour silo. There is a mailroom, a parking garage, an accounting department, a security force, a retirement plan, a fire department and a full-service cafeteria, where a manager not long ago spotted a man on the lunch line eating a sandwich, a bag of chips and drinking a soft drink.\n\n“My mother would have said he wasn’t using good manners,” Mr. Mickle said.\n\nIn the cookie business, the unheralded ingredients are typically the ones that contribute the most to profits. In Oreos, they are the flour, sugar, baking soda, cocoa and vegetable oil, the same as in other mass-market cookies.\n\nBut they also include hydrogenated vegetable oil, which is where the big money is. With $50 million in revenue a year, this ingredient, known as H.O.V., is by far Nabisco’s most valuable byproduct, and it plays a crucial role in the creation of the secret formula for Oreos.\n\nMost cookies are relatively low in saturated fat. But Oreos are notable for their high levels of it. That is because the oil, a byproduct of soybean oil production, is hardened by hydrogenation to create trans fat, which gives the cookies their characteristic filling and makes them last longer on the shelf.\n\nWhile trans fat is banned by the federal government in foods like margarine, it is still widely used in cookies, crackers and other processed foods, because it extends their shelf life, and that of all the ingredients that contain it, by months or even years.\n\nDr. Mehmet C. Oz, the heart surgeon and television personality, said he considers trans fat to be a poison. In a recent broadcast, he asked, “Why is it still in our food supply?”\n\nThe public has been moving away from trans fat for years. As recently as 2004, the amount of it used in food production was 7.5 million pounds. Last year, that had fallen to about 5 million pounds, according to the Grocery Manufacturers Association. The association, which represents about 300 food companies, has lobbied the F.D.A. to drop the requirement for trans fat labeling, saying the government had made its point.\n\n“We have already done what we can do,” said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and public health at New York University.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder the rules of the trade group, Nabisco is still allowed to use hydrogenated oil in Oreos, but the company would not disclose how much is used. The company is not alone. None of the major manufacturers of cookies, crackers and other foods containing hydrogenated oil, including Kraft, Kellogg and General Mills, would say how much they used.\n\n“Our position is that we don’t discuss our proprietary formulas,” said Kirstie Foster, a spokeswoman for General Mills.\n\nThe oil makes up the largest component of the cookies’ weight. “That’s the reason they have that nice, big, crunchy mouth feel,” said Richard Baker, a retired food scientist who worked for the General Foods Corporation and helped develop the Oreo.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven as consumers and food companies move away from trans fat, the food industry has been slow to adjust because it is not a primary ingredient in any product, but a valuable byproduct of other ingredients. For instance, an Oreo contains about three parts by weight of flour to one part of hydrogenated oil. So if Nabisco eliminated the oil, it would need three times as much flour to make the same amount of cookies.\n\n“It’s one of those cases where you have to change everything to get rid of it,” Mr. Baker said.\n\nThe F.D.A. has been trying for a decade to get food companies to eliminate trans fat from their products. While many companies have done so, others have been slow to act. In January, the F.D.A. said that it would begin enforcing its rule requiring food companies to list the amount of trans fat in their products.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They tried adding vegetable oil, but that created a more greasy filling. They tried reducing the fat content, but that made the cookies less flavorful and more difficult to push off the assembly line. In the end, they simply removed the trans fat.\n\nThe company would not say how it did that. But, according to former Nabisco employees, the solution is as simple as the formula itself. Oreos have been made with hydrogenated oil for more than 80 years, so the company simply replaces that oil with regular vegetable oil. In doing so, it cuts down on the fat content and gets rid of trans fat.\n\nThey are also made with a secret ingredient, an additive that is proprietary, that stabilizes the cookies, giving them a consistent look and taste. This ingredient is also used in several other Nabisco cookies, including Chips Ahoy.\n\n“When we remove trans fat, it allows us to lower the overall fat content of the product,” Mr. Mickle said. “So now it’s 6 grams of fat per serving, which is right where we want to be, if not a little better.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike the old formula, the new Oreo, which will be in stores in early summer, maintains the characteristic “snap, crackle and pop” of the cookie. It has the same crunch, taste and shelf life. And it still contains 3 milligrams of sodium, which Nabisco executives say is half of what is recommended as a daily allowance.\n\nAs the Oreo has changed, the cookie has remained a signature brand, an American icon. It was born in the early 20th century, when the National Biscuit Company introduced the Oreo Biscuit. (Oreo is short for Oreo Biscuit, not Oreos. A cookie is singular.) It was called the Oreo Sandwich Cookie from 1912 to 1952, and then the Oreo Creme Sandwich Cookie from 1952 to 1963.\n\nThe Nabisco snack food line is now so successful that it outsells its main rival, Keebler, by more than two to one.\n\nBut the idea that an Oreo has three layers, the most important of which is the white filling, is not actually true.\n\n“It’s not like we have some supersecret proprietary filling,” said Peter Ross, a spokesman for Nabisco. “The formula for the cookie hasn’t changed at all.”\n\nIn a piece of promotional material, Nabisco describes the filling as “creamy” and “naturally and artificially flavored,” but no one would describe it as the signature ingredient.\n\n“I like them, but it’s the cookie that has always been the hero,” Mr. Baker said. “It’s a cookie, and the filling is just part of it.”\n\nThe success of the Oreo has long been a source of pride at Nabisco, even when things were going badly. When the National Biscuit Company was hit by strikes in the early 1980s, Mr. Baker helped to develop an Oreo knockoff that was still being made in the 1990s. He calls it the “M&M cookie,” for Mary and Mars, the companies that make M&M’s and Snickers bars. The secret to the Oreo is that it is no secret. The formula is an open secret.\n\nBut the formula has always been closely guarded.\n\n“What I would never do is talk about the formula,” said William T. Keough, who ran the National Biscuit Company in the early 1970s. “It was a sacred thing. We would never share it with anyone.”<|endoftext|>Edward Hennessey\n\n\n\nEdward Hennessey has written for Vanity Fair, GQ, Men's Journal, and many other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.

According to the Daily Mail, Tottenham are set to \"make a bid\" for Marouane Fellaini in the January transfer window. The Belgian has been on and off the radar of the North London club for quite some time now, as we have been one of the sides heavily linked to the midfielder in the last couple of years.\n\nFellaini is out of contract at the end of the season, meaning that he can leave Everton at the end of this campaign if he so chooses. His former manager, David Moyes, recently confirmed that his exit from the club was likely, with clubs all over Europe reported to be interested.\n\nWith that in mind, I felt like it was time for a bit of a look back into this rumour. So here are my three main reasons why signing Fellaini is a bad idea.\n\nThere are other options out there.\n\nThis might seem like an obvious statement, but there really are other, better options out there for the club. We've already spent over £20m on Paulinho this summer, and the club are in desperate need of creativity. However, with that creativity also comes an understanding of the game and of football in general, which is something that Fellaini just doesn't have.\n\nTo put it into a better context, Fellaini has scored four goals for Everton this season. In the same amount of time, Roberto Soldado has scored 12 goals for Tottenham. I'm not even suggesting that Soldado is a perfect striker, but he does provide the creativity that we need in the side.\n\nWith that creativity comes a much higher risk. But is that risk worth it?\n\nFellaini is injury prone.\n\nIn three out of the last four seasons, Fellaini has played less than 20 games. The player has struggled with injuries throughout his entire career, and this is something that just cannot be ignored.\n\nHowever, there are some positives to take from this. In the seasons that Fellaini has managed to stay injury free, he has scored a total of 15 goals. Whilst this is not a great return, it shows that when he is fit, he is still a dangerous player. But the thing is, we have no idea when he will be fit, or how many games he will play.\n\nFellaini has a bad attitude.\n\nFellaini has had some controversies in his time at Everton, and some of these have left the club in a very difficult situation. Last season, Fellaini reportedly refused to sit on the substitutes bench for Everton's game against West Ham, and he was suspended by the club as a result.\n\nThere are also rumours that he was involved in a training ground fight with Phil Neville, and that he once played while carrying a broken wrist.\n\nIn 2009, Fellaini was involved in a car crash, in which he tried to escape the scene of the accident by leaving the scene on foot. As a result, he was banned for three matches, but he escaped jail time.\n\nThis season, he was the victim of racial abuse during Everton's FA Cup tie with Leicester. However, instead of dealing with the abuse head on, he decided to let it go, with his manager, Roberto Martinez, claiming that he had done so for the good of the team.\n\nWhilst Fellaini is a very good player, I think that the negatives of his character and his injury problems outweigh his positives. And with Tottenham in need of creativity, is Fellaini really the right man for the job?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Fellaini? Would you be happy with his signing? Or are you happy with the players that we have already signed? Get in touch on Twitter, and share your thoughts.<|endoftext|>The Obama administration may have been looking for more than just greater tax revenues when it let banks off with a slap on the wrist for misdeeds leading up to the financial crisis.\n\nOn Monday, a Treasury Department official disclosed that government policy is also to promote diversity in the financial industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The secretary is deeply committed to ensuring that our financial system is not only safer but also more inclusive,” said Mary J. Miller, Treasury’s assistant secretary for financial institutions. “We have made significant progress toward this goal since the financial crisis, and we will continue to take steps to promote diversity.”\n\nThe statement came in an official report to the Senate Banking Committee about the administration’s implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.\n\nThe “other purpose” of the banking industry’s $25 billion legal settlement was to “promote financial stability and inclusive access to financial services,” the Treasury said.\n\nThe disclosure comes on the heels of a New York Times article that criticized the administration for pressuring banks to hire women and minorities.\n\nThe article quoted regulators, who wanted to levy more serious charges against banks for their role in the financial crisis, but were pushed back by political appointees in the White House.\n\nThe Justice Department has received about $37 billion from financial institutions for settling claims related to mortgage-backed securities sold before the crisis, which was the core of the subprime-mortgage crisis.\n\nFederal agencies split the money, with about $9 billion going to the Treasury and the rest to Justice, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).\n\nIt is not clear which regulators were pressuring for the banks to hire more minorities.\n\n“I don’t know where they’re getting their guidance from,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Financial Services Committee. “There is a lot of good, strong, important effort to make sure there is diversity in the financial system. But I can’t tell you it is coming from the administration.”\n\n“I’m not aware of the administration’s influence over these settlements,” Himes said.\n\nAt a hearing on Tuesday, Republicans questioned the diversity reports that the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators prepare to Congress, focusing on the race and gender of the chief executives at banks with more than $1 billion in assets.\n\nThe FDIC’s annual report to Congress, which included the 2012 figures, showed the top 20 chief executives of U.S. banks were white, with five black or African-American CEOs and four Latinos.\n\nHimes said he was happy that the report was made public, even if it didn’t mention the administration.\n\n“I can’t say the administration is the author of the report,” Himes said. “But I can tell you that they are very pleased that the data is out there and the committee is raising the issue.”\n\nSince the financial crisis, there has been a strong focus on expanding minority access to the financial system, with Treasury and the Fed holding annual conferences and offering special programs to reach minority communities.\n\nHimes said that Dodd-Frank was important in making sure minority banks have access to the Federal Reserve’s credit facility, which was not as strong during the crisis.\n\n“I would be very surprised if there were any political pressure exerted on the Fed on this point,” Himes said.\n\nOverall, the banking industry has made significant strides in diversity since the financial crisis, with some Wall Street firms approaching the targets mandated by Dodd-Frank.\n\nMorgan Stanley has more than 30 percent of its executives and managing directors who are minorities or women, and will meet its Dodd-Frank requirement next year.\n\nAt JPMorgan Chase, nearly 23 percent of senior-level executives are women and 15 percent are minorities.\n\nBoth firms are exceeding the overall Dodd-Frank requirement that at least 33 percent of senior-level executives are women or minorities.\n\nThe largest firms have a much higher percentage of senior-level executives, because it is tougher to meet the goals in middle management, where they are struggling to meet the quotas.\n\n“It’s pretty impressive,” Himes said. “They have made great strides and that reflects well on the industry.”<|endoftext|>Here is an outstanding article from the Chronicle of Higher Education about one of the best law schools in the country (University of California, Irvine). The article talks about the decline in applications (from a high of 4841 in 2004 to 2958 this year), the declining numbers of applicants who actually get in (down from 707 in 2004 to 473 this year) and the declining LSAT scores of those applicants (down from 168 to 163 on average). So, the school is obviously not doing a very good job of \"marketing\" itself to potential students. But the real scandal is the fact that this outstanding, public law school, that provides excellent access to underserved, underprivileged minorities for less than half the cost of the more prestigious private schools, is somehow, inexplicably, NOT ON THE LIST of schools which students can submit a fee waiver to for a chance to get in without paying the $64,000 per year tuition!\n\n\nWhat this means, in effect, is that even the most brilliant, motivated, disadvantaged minority student would still be FORCED to pay the outrageous tuition at one of the elite law schools if they want a shot at getting a good job as a lawyer in the future!\n\n\nWhile there is"
"She's known for her boundary-pushing sense of style, and Gwyneth Paltrow once again proved she has no qualms about showing off her body in public, as she was spotted going for a low-key walk in Hollywood on Sunday.\n\nWearing a white blouse with a plunging neckline, which highlighted her ample cleavage, the 45-year-old cut a striking figure as she made her way home.\n\nA large cross-body bag was slung across her body, while a pair of tinted sunglasses hid her eyes, as she swept her dark locks off her face.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nStyle maven: Gwyneth Paltrow looked incredible as she headed out for a stroll in Los Angeles on Sunday\n\nGwyneth wore a pair of low-slung blue jeans and a pair of simple flats, while she carried a bottle of water as she made her way back to her home.\n\nThe Oscar winner, who shares two children with Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, was in the company of a male friend, as the pair chatted as they made their way home.\n\nHer outing comes just weeks after the actress was seen ditching her glam look to don some unkempt hair and a pair of baggy sweatpants, as she was spotted enjoying a night at a coffee shop in Brentwood.\n\nPretty: Gwyneth, 45, looked stunning in a low-cut white top, blue jeans and a large cross-body bag as she made her way home\n\nJust the two of us: The Oscar winner was in the company of a male friend\n\nNo fuss: Gwyneth wore her hair swept up in a messy ponytail, while she sported a simple pair of flats\n\nThe mother-of-two cut a casual figure as she was joined by her chef pal, who was also dressed down in a blue hoodie.\n\nGwyneth was later seen heading into the Ralph's supermarket and as she returned home, she was once again dressed casually in a grey zip-up top and black skinny jeans.\n\nGwyneth was joined by Chris in 2010 and they went on to marry the following year.\n\nRelaxed: Gwyneth was spotted leaving a supermarket with her chef pal on Tuesday\n\nThe family unit: Gwyneth is pictured with her children Apple, nine, and Moses, seven, in Beverly Hills in April\n\nTogether they have two children - daughter Apple, nine, and son Moses, seven.\n\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2010, Gwyneth said: 'I feel like my life is very rich and I'm not even in a partnership.'\n\nShe added: 'A lot of people have come up to me and said, \"Your kids are so well behaved.\" And I'm like, \"Are you being serious right now?\"'\n\nHer interview with Oprah came after she gave a lengthy interview with the New York Times, where she opened up about her life as a single mother.\n\nIn the interview, she said: 'I've had people ask me before, \"What's your secret?

"Elderly fall risk 'skyrocketed' in UK hospitals\n\nElderly people are being placed at \"huge risk\" by NHS hospitals, a report warns.\n\nAn investigation into the state of care of the elderly found patients being given the wrong drugs, going without vital care, and not being treated with dignity.\n\nExperts from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) found that while some services were good, there was \"much variation\" in the way hospitals cared for the elderly.\n\nThe report, compiled from statistics on admissions in 2011-12 and patient experiences, revealed that over a third of people admitted to hospital in the last year of life fell while in the care of hospital staff.\n\nThe figure rose to 44% in the last two weeks of life, when patients are often admitted for palliative care.\n\nThis happened despite recommendations that patients are to be offered falls prevention assessments, and given safety aids if they need them.\n\nResearchers found that nearly a third of patients given medication were given the wrong dose, with 15% given less than half of the prescribed dose.\n\nThis included children, teenagers, women in the last three months of pregnancy, patients in mental health wards and patients with kidney failure.\n\nPoor care of the elderly was found in large hospitals and specialist units, such as hospices, with variations in care found in hospitals across the UK.\n\nAn NHS England spokesman said: \"The NHS works hard to give the very best care to all patients, including those who are elderly, and these findings reflect that.\n\n\"However, as the report highlights, some patients can receive care that is not of the standard they expect or deserve, and there is clearly more work to be done to ensure we provide consistent and safe care for all our patients.\n\n\"In common with all healthcare systems, the NHS faces challenges in ensuring consistent care for patients with increasingly complex needs.\n\n\"While some trusts are facing such challenges in a unique way, others are also working hard to ensure that all patients get the same level of safe and high quality care.\n\n\"We expect all hospitals to examine and learn from the report's findings, which will help to drive forward improvements in care and patient safety.\"\n\nJoanne Stuart, chief executive of the Caring Choices Campaign, said: \"The NHS is so much better at providing care for people in hospital than it used to be, but the report shows that a lot more work needs to be done to make sure that all elderly people get high quality, consistent care in hospital.\n\n\"All too often, patients don't get the kind of care they deserve and we need to stop this happening.\n\n\"Hospitals must take action to make sure that care is more consistent, with elderly people and their families having a better idea of what to expect and what they can do to make sure they get the best possible care.\n\n\"We would also urge the NHS to adopt the NICE guidelines on care of the dying, which will make a real difference to care in the last days and hours of life.\"\n\nDr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: \"While this report shows the majority of older people are getting good care in hospital, it also shows that for some the experience is a long way from good enough.\n\n\"That's why the RCN, alongside the Department of Health and others, is looking to see how we can improve care, so we see fewer preventable hospital admissions and fewer falls and delays in people getting treatment.\"\n\nLast month, the chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, warned that the NHS needs to provide better care for the elderly to reduce the number of avoidable deaths.\n\nHis call came as figures from the Office for National Statistics showed there were 21,866 \"excess deaths\" of people aged 75 and over in England in 2011.\n\nThe number of elderly people dying in hospital has also risen by 35% in a decade, according to the figures.\n\nSir Mike said: \"We know that people receive better care when they're closer to home. In the majority of cases the treatment people receive in hospital is good, but as we get older it becomes increasingly important to get the care right, because we have more complex needs.\"\n\nSir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said: \"Most patients are very satisfied with the care they receive, but we need to see more consistency to ensure all people get the best possible care, when they need it.\"\n\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \"The quality of end-of-life care is hugely important to us and we expect hospitals to be looking at this in detail to ensure patients receive the best possible care at the end of their lives.\n\n\"We are also strengthening care of the dying with the imminent publication of NICE guidelines which will set out good practice in care of the dying.\"\n\nCopyright Press Association 2013<|endoftext|>Key points of crypto\n\nIt is possible to invest in crypto by learning the tricks of the trade\n\nIt is also possible to spend your time on reading and learning all that you need to know.

The house was sold and the Egans’ wills were locked in a safe.\n\nSharon Egan said she is struggling to get by. She has $600 a month from CPP, $2,000 a month from Canada Pension and a $1,400 monthly pension from the Ontario government, and pays $800 a month in rent.\n\nShe relies on her cataract surgery benefits for eye care, and pays out of pocket for dental.\n\nThe Egans' wills were locked in a safe.\n\nHer adult children told her she would receive the $2 million in insurance money, but she hasn’t seen a penny.\n\n“I’m not a millionaire,” she said. “I can barely afford to live on what I have.”\n\nThe sisters-in-law have never spoken in person and haven’t seen each other since Shawna and Neil died.\n\nThe Egans' wills were locked in a safe.\n\nShawna’s daughter, Meaghan, 20, wants to meet her grandmother, but cannot unless she takes a DNA test.\n\n“I am a young 20-year-old and have my whole life ahead of me,” Meaghan said. “I’m not really worried about the money.”\n\n“I’d like to have my grandmother in my life, that’s what I really want,” she said.\n\nFellow Pickering resident Lesli Miller-Koch told CityNews that she has not spoken to her daughter, Kimberly, in two years.\n\n“I miss her,” Miller-Koch said. “I miss her, I miss her. I really do.”\n\nCityNews reached out to the Egans’ executor and Shawna’s executor for comment.<|endoftext|>Young Women Leaders Program (YWLP) | April 26, 2017\n\nThe Young Women Leaders Program (YWLP) is now accepting applications for the 2017 class.

These messages were meant to show solidarity with the people of Paris and to also symbolize the hope that peace and love will eventually prevail. However, one police department in Philadelphia was less than enthused with these beautiful sentiments and arrested a man for writing “pray for Paris” in chalk outside of a local train station.\n\nSadly, this is not the first time that the police have shut down people who have tried to show their support for the French people. While the government claims that they are in lock-down and on high alert because of these attacks, these arrests just prove that they are just using the Paris attacks as an excuse to stop free speech. It is ironic that the police are allowing everyone to wear the French flag on their shirt and fly it from their houses but they will arrest people for drawing a peaceful message in chalk. In fact, you don’t even have to be “supporting” Paris to get arrested, the police even arrested someone for writing “pray for peace” in chalk on the sidewalk.\n\nThis is yet another example of how the police in America are rapidly becoming the enemy of the people. Every day, it seems that a new video goes viral of an officer abusing their power and dishing out violence. This is a perfect example of a “thin blue line” that is not protecting the citizens but instead protecting other officers when they cross the line. It is almost as if the police are now the biggest gang in America.\n\nThe world is a scary place, especially right now. However, the people will always find a way to express themselves. No matter what country, people will always write things on the ground. The fact that the police in Philadelphia arrested someone for writing “pray for Paris” shows that they are living in the past and do not realize that the world has changed.\n\nFor instance, when people look back at this time period, they will look at these arrests as the final straw that broke the camel’s back. This was the point in time where the police were no longer protecting and serving the people but instead were abusing their power and violating the rights of the people. The next time that the police decide to lock down an entire city because of a bomb scare, you might see all of the citizens walking around with pieces of chalk, showing solidarity with the people of Paris and showing the world that they will not stand for these types of actions.\n\n*Published 10/18/15\n\nJoshua Krause was born and raised in the Bay Area.

During the Great Depression in the United States, the public felt that the government should do more to help the needy in the country and abroad. In addition, leaders in Latin America were alarmed by the growing fascist movement in Europe.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1939, the Good Neighbor Policy was followed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Good Neighbor Policy stated that the United States was not interested in annexing Latin American countries or interfering in their governments. It was seen as a way of helping the United States avoid another war like World War I and to achieve peace and stability in the region.\n\nOne result of the Good Neighbor Policy was the decision by many Latin American countries to sever ties with Germany and Japan. These countries also rejected German and Japanese proposals to form alliances in the Americas. In addition, many Latin American countries also announced that they would not trade with Nazi Germany.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1941, the Good Neighbor Policy helped to restore trade between the United States and Latin America. It also resulted in some efforts to help poor countries develop their economies.<|endoftext|>If you would like to see more articles like this please support our coverage of the space program by becoming a Spaceflight Now Member .

"One of the main features of GitLab’s Continuous Integration (CI) is its ability to test your code with a variety of tests and coveralls.\n\nThe testing procedure usually consists of a script that you can implement yourself. In this article, I will demonstrate how to automate the testing procedure of JSF application using GitLab and Junit.\n\nHere is the complete GitLab CI configuration file:\n\nimage: java:openjdk-8 stages: - test - deploy test: stage: test image: localhost:8010 stages: - check-java-dependencies - run-selenium test-selenium: stage: test script: - jdk: name: openjdk8 - junit: name: junit - clean-builds - selenium: start-server: name: selenium_server_start url: http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/ results: reports: html: - coveralls - results-xml deploy: stage: deploy image: localhost:8010 deploy: replicas: 3 script: - apt-get: name: openjdk-8-jdk update: - gitlab-ci-multi-runner update-runner --web java:openjdk-8 - mvn: name: junit - build-project: groupId: net.idcl.sample artifactId: sample-project - deploy: name: war target: /tmp/project deploy: replicas: 3\n\nTesting the JSF application\n\nFirst, we need to create a Java class to be tested. In this example, I will use a JSF library. The library will contain a simple form that will accept and validate input from the user.\n\npublic class Sample { public static void main(String[] args) { Sample test = new Sample(); test.mainForm(); } @Autowired private FacesContext context; private void mainForm() { context.addMessage(\"Form submitted...\"); } }\n\nThe next step is to create a unit test, which can be done with the help of JUnit. Here is the corresponding unit test:\n\npublic class SampleJunit { @Rule public MockitoJUnitRule rule = new MockitoJUnitRule(); @Mock private Sample test; @Before public void init() { // @After public void end() { // } @Test public void testMainForm() { test.setMessage(\"Form submitted...\"); expect(test.mainForm()).andReturn(null); rule.doNothing().when(test); verify(test).mainForm(); } }\n\nTo make things work, you will need to add junit to your classpath.\n\nNext, we can set up GitLab’s JUnit runner. The JUnit runner can be enabled by adding the following lines to the .gitlab-ci.yml file:\n\nbefore_script: - mvn test -Dgitlab.junit.gitlab-ci.executable.version=1.6.0\n\nHere, the version of JUnit is explicitly set in the .gitlab-ci.yml file. To get the current version, we can check it on GitLab, under Settings > CI/CD > Advanced configuration.\n\nRunning the test\n\nAfter that, we can push the code to GitLab’s master branch and run the test. When all the tests are successful, the result of the test is as follows:\n\nIf the test fails, the result looks like this:\n\nDeploying a JSF application\n\nAfter we’ve successfully tested the JSF application, the next step is to deploy the application on a server. To make it work, we need to install GitLab’s Runner on the server, which is done through the command line:\n\ncurl -L https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/binaries/gitlab-ci-multi-runner.deb -o gitlab-ci-multi-runner.deb sudo dpkg -i gitlab-ci-multi-runner.deb\n\nNext, we can configure the deployment on the server. For this, we need to add a runner to the .gitlab-ci.yml file:\n\nstages: - test - deploy test: stage: test image: localhost:8010 stages: - check-java-dependencies - run-selenium test-selenium: stage: test script: - jdk: name: openjdk8 - junit: name: junit - clean-builds - selenium: start-server: name: selenium_server_start url: http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/ results: reports: html: - coveralls - results-xml deploy: stage: deploy image: localhost:8010 deploy: replicas: 3 script: - apt-get: name: openjdk-8-jdk update: - gitlab-ci-multi-runner update-runner --web java:openjdk-8 - mvn: name: junit - build-project: groupId: net.idcl.sample artifactId: sample-project - deploy: name: war target: /tmp/project deploy: replicas: 3\n\nHere, the runner is used for the test phase. After that, the runner is installed on the server, and the project is deployed.<|endoftext|>President Trump's ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and restrictions on refugee admissions will not get in the way of U.S. efforts to combat terrorism, the Trump administration said in a court filing late Tuesday.\n\nThe filing in a federal court in Hawaii offered the administration's first full-throated defense of the new policy in the wake of a decision by a federal judge in Hawaii who put the order on hold.\n\nThe new policy will allow officials to more rigorously review the backgrounds of those seeking entry from countries where terrorism is rampant, the government said.\n\n\"The Order is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,\" the Justice Department said in its brief.\n\nThe Trump administration said that if the new policy were restricted, terrorists seeking entry to the U.S. would \"have a greater opportunity to hide in the United States.\"\n\nThe Justice Department also pushed back on criticism of the new policy from the bench, with one judge in Virginia, Leonie M. Brinkema, describing the president's actions as a \"mean-spirited\" attempt to keep Muslims out of the country.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said that critics are engaged in \"pure speculation\" about how the president's policy will be carried out, particularly when it comes to granting waivers to people who wish to enter the U.S. despite the new policy.\n\nCritics also are misrepresenting how refugees are vetted, the government said. \"The order expressly contemplates the issuance of waivers to allow people into the country in appropriate circumstances,\" the Justice Department said.\n\nThe government said the courts should defer to the president on the entry of immigrants from dangerous countries, as well as on the refugee program.\n\n\"The president is authorized under the Constitution and laws of the United States to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens outside the United States when he deems it in the nation's interest,\" the Justice Department said.\n\nThe government's court filing came in response to a lawsuit in Hawaii that accused the Trump administration of discriminating against Muslims and asked for a nationwide temporary restraining order.\n\n\"This is not the first time the defendants have asked this court to ignore the impacts of the executive order on individuals,\" said the brief filed by Neal Katyal, a lawyer for the state of Hawaii. \"Nor will it be the last time they try to defend a decision that has harmed so many people.\"\n\n\nCopyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

He had been in the car for \"an extended amount of time,\" police said.\n\nLAPD Capt.

"4:04pm: Steve Adams has been sent down to Triple-A, while Heath Phillips has been called up, according to a club announcement.\n\n12:11pm: The Cubs have promoted left-handed reliever Justin Hancock to the big league roster, tweets Mark Gonzales of the Chicago Tribune. The corresponding move is unknown. Hancock takes the roster spot of right-hander Jake Arrieta, who was placed on the paternity leave list today.\n\nThe 27-year-old Hancock is a rather late bloomer, having signed with the Cubs as an undrafted free agent in 2010. He spent four years in the team’s minor league system, working his way up the ladder, before ultimately earning a call-up to the majors last year. Hancock posted a 1.17 ERA in 30 1/3 innings in his debut season, striking out 8.7 and walking 3.6 batters per nine innings. He has spent this season with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs, pitching to a 2.33 ERA with 8.3 K/9, 2.7 BB/9 and a 40.7 percent ground-ball rate in 38 innings.\n\nAs for the corresponding move to clear space on the roster, manager Joe Maddon suggested to reporters that it could be a swap of right-handers, meaning Brian Duensing or Justin Grimm could be headed to the 10-day DL. However, the Cubs could simply make a move to clear space for Hancock.<|endoftext|>Mark Dice \"Hacks\" Into Facebook, Gets A Trillion Likes\n\nIn a video from conservative conspiracy theorist Mark Dice, he states that Facebook is \"making it up as they go along\" and that he was able to hack into the social media website to manipulate the number of likes on the page.\n\nClaiming that Facebook doesn't have a firewall, Dice states he was able to \"hack into it to set whatever Facebook page 'likes' he wanted.\"\n\nAccording to Dice, he was able to like Barack Obama's page on Facebook a trillion times.\n\nHow to Hack Facebook in 5 Minutes and 20 seconds: Mark Dice Edition\n\nH/T TruthRevolt<|endoftext|>Join us on an expedition to discover the land of Saguenay, a land of majesty, a land of beauty, a land of legends.

I was supposed to reach Jaisalmer by noon but the journey was delayed due to a technical problem in the train.\n\nThere was a confusion and it seemed as if all trains going to Jaisalmer had to cross the Jaisalmer railway station. The train departed from Nizamuddin station at 2.45 pm and we reached Jaisalmer at 6.30 am. We all know that our Indian Railways are in pathetic conditions but our train journey from Delhi to Jaisalmer was the most comfortable train journey I had till date. The train had an AC chair car, a sleeper class and the top most travel class. There was a lot of empty space in the lower class and I was happy to find a berth in the lower class.\n\nBut soon my happiness turned into anxiety. I was sitting in the middle of a group of army officers who were travelling to Jaisalmer. These men were burly and they were talking to each other in a language which I did not understand. One of the men kept staring at me and he soon came to me and asked for a seat. I had no problem in giving him the seat as I had two seats next to me. I offered him a chair and I stood near the door. After half an hour the man spoke to me in Hindi and I asked him what he was doing in Jaisalmer. He told me that he was going to meet his colleague and that he was a Lieutenant in the Indian Army.\n\nHe asked me to sit beside him and I obliged. Soon we were talking about everything under the sky. I asked him how many times he had visited Jaisalmer and he told me that he was going to Jaisalmer for the first time. I was surprised to hear this and I asked him about the weather in Jaisalmer. The Lieutenant told me that Jaisalmer was always cold and the summers were unbearable. I wondered why a man who was going to Jaisalmer for the first time was so informed about the weather. The Lieutenant must have guessed what I was thinking because he told me that he had seen the place in the photographs and that he was going to the place because of his profession.\n\nI smiled and told him that I was in the same profession and I was going to Jaisalmer to shoot a story for my media house.\n\n\"Really?\" asked the Lieutenant, \"What is the name of the media house?\"\n\n\"Zoom.\"\n\n\"Zoom is a famous media house.\"\n\n\"It is indeed.\"\n\n\"I saw your photographs in Zoom's website and I was awestruck. You must be a very good photographer.\"\n\n\"I am learning photography.\"\n\n\"May I see your cameras?\"\n\nI took out the two cameras which I had with me. The Lieutenant looked at my cameras and he seemed to be a photography expert. I saw him switch on my camera and he started fiddling with the buttons. He pressed the zoom button and zoomed into the lens of my camera. The Lieutenant said, \"It is a good camera and it is expensive. I hope you do not get it stolen. Do you want me to keep it for you?\"\n\nI thanked him for the offer and I asked him about the camera I had in my hand.\n\n\"This is a good camera,\" said the Lieutenant, \"I like it a lot.\"\n\nHe took my camera in his hand and he looked at me and said, \"Will you give me this camera?\"\n\nI looked at him and I asked him, \"Why do you want my camera?\"\n\n\"Because you will be going to the Army area and you may not be able to take photographs.\"\n\n\"But I can take photographs in the Army area too. Besides, you can help me to click the photographs. You are an Army man.\"\n\nThe Lieutenant smiled and said, \"I am just an ordinary Lieutenant and you must be aware that the area which you are going to is highly sensitive. There are armed guards all around. You will be in great trouble if you try to take photographs in that area. I will help you to click the photographs and besides, I am an Army man. I can help you.\"\n\nI thought for a while and I agreed to give him my camera.\n\nThe train soon reached Jaisalmer and it was 6.30 am. I was the first one to get down the train. I took out my bags and when I turned back I saw that the Lieutenant had already come out of the train.\n\n\"Where is your camera?\" asked the Lieutenant.\n\nI told him that I had kept my camera in the train.\n\n\"You are mad. Who will help you in clicking photographs? Do you want me to take the camera from the train?\"\n\nI shook my head. The Lieutenant did not waste any time and he asked me to wait for him near the train. The Lieutenant went to the train and in less than ten minutes he came back with my camera. He handed over the camera to me and asked me to pay Rs. 500 for my camera.\n\n\"Why do you want to pay me for my camera?\"\n\n\"Because it is not your camera. You had left the camera in the train and I am returning it to you.\"\n\nI looked at him and I told him that I did not have 500 rupees with me. I told him that I had only 250 rupees in my bag.\n\n\"Will that be enough?\"\n\nThe Lieutenant smiled and he said, \"That will be fine. Just give me the money and you can keep the camera.\"\n\nI took out the money from my bag and gave it to him. The Lieutenant took the money and he put the money in his trouser pocket and he told me to keep the camera in my bag.\n\n\"Where are you staying?\"\n\n\"I am not sure where I am going to stay.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I will help you.\"\n\nI thanked him and the Lieutenant told me that he had booked a room in Hotel Haveli.\n\n\"Why have you booked a room in the Hotel Haveli? I don't like the hotel. You can stay with me.\"\n\n\"I don't want to trouble you.\"\n\n\""
"Qua , 14/07/2015 às 10:25\n\nAgência Estado\n\ncomentários\n\nO secretário especial de Previdência e Trabalho, Miguel Rossetto, defendeu a aprovação da PEC 287/16, que estabelece um teto de gastos para o governo federal, e aprovou críticas feitas por líderes de movimentos sociais de que o texto prejudica os pobres. \"É fundamental avançar nesse sentido\", disse. Segundo ele, a emenda constitucional poderá ser feita porque hoje já existe um teto que não é cumprido.A PEC estabelece que, para o período 2016-2026, não poderá ser gasto mais que 18,5% da Receita Corrente Líquida (RCL) no ano anterior. Para esse período, a projeção é que a população brasileira passe de 200 milhões para 270 milhões de habitantes. De acordo com Rossetto, a aprovação da emenda é \"fundamental\" para garantir um piso para os gastos públicos.Para o secretário, \"o mais importante\" do texto é \"que ele estabelece um piso para os gastos do país\", como defendem os próprios movimentos sociais. \"O governo já tem compromissos estabelecidos e obrigações constitucionais. O importante é cumprir o que está no texto. Não se pode dizer que é ou não uma PEC\", disse Rossetto, após participar de seminário sobre Previdência Social.Ao defender a aprovação da emenda, Rossetto citou a previsão de que o Brasil terá uma população de 270 milhões de habitantes ao final da década. \"Não é uma visão restrita a esse momento. Temos um crescimento populacional estimado em torno de 1,2% ao ano, e nós vamos ter uma população ao final do período em torno de 270 milhões de pessoas\", disse o secretário, acrescentando que o país tem uma população jovem e que a mudança na estrutura da economia brasileira tem permitido o aumento do consumo de bens duráveis, alimentação e serviços. \"O povo brasileiro está consumindo\", disse.Rossetto afirmou ainda que, se não houver aprovação da emenda, \"os estados vão entrar em colapso, não conseguirão pagar aposentadorias, porque não terão mais dinheiro\". \"Os estados são a base do sistema, estão em crise profunda, e se a economia não crescer, vai piorar muito\", disse. \"Não adianta achar que vai se resolver com as políticas sociais. O gasto primário federal com políticas sociais foi em torno de 7% da RCL, quase 4% é financiado pelo governo federal. Se não se coloca um piso de gastos, não é possível cumprir o que está estabelecido\", argumentou.Ele observou ainda que \"a dívida do Brasil é inferior a de outros países da América Latina, a média dos países latinos é superior a 50% da RCL, enquanto o Brasil tem 35%\". \"Não podemos continuar crescendo. O nível de gasto é muito maior do que o da economia. No período 2003-2013, os gastos primários do governo cresceram mais de 80% e a RCL cresceu menos de 70%\", argumentou.Rossetto ainda voltou a defender a aprovação da reforma da Previdência Social e disse que, caso a PEC 287 não seja aprovada, não haverá outra alternativa. \"É o único caminho para assegurar a sustentabilidade do sistema, que passa pela aprovação da PEC\", disse. \"A sustentabilidade só existe se você tiver uma economia que cresce e gera empregos, e é isso que estamos fazendo\", afirmou. \"E o projeto de lei que está sendo discutido no Congresso prevê a valorização do trabalho\", afirmou, referindo-se às alterações propostas pelo governo na proposta que discutirá na Câmara.<|endoftext|>Mobile homes need to be given the same attention that we give our family homes.

President Obama is skipping this grieving duty, choosing instead to avoid any appearance of terrorism by attending a celebrity dinner with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nPresident Obama, a prime-time president, must be towing the standard-issue presidential line on terrorism. Terrorist shootings are the unfortunate acts of a mentally unstable person. Calling a shooting a terrorist attack is a prime act of character assassination, a cheap attempt to advance an agenda. It’s similar to calling a black man a racist. For a president to be so callous to a tragedy is repulsive, but not surprising.\n\nPresident Obama should have gone to Fort Hood.\n\nI hope the families don’t mind me using this tragedy as a teachable moment.\n\nAbout the same time I posted my last entry on my blog (which the Al Jazeera English link points to) in which I expressed my condolences to the families of the Fort Hood tragedy, my mom forwarded me an e-mail she received from my niece in Atlanta.\n\nIt read:\n\nToday in the Atlanta airport I was in the line for TSA security when I overheard two women in line behind me. They were talking about how horrible it was that the soldier who shot all those people in the Army post had been given the death penalty. One said she didn’t see how the President could have “signed off” on it. Then the other lady said it was the president who ordered it! I nearly fell over. As I’m sure you know, they were referring to Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter.\n\nI’m not kidding. These people honestly think the commander-in-chief signed off on the death penalty for a military officer for killing other military officers in the name of Allah!\n\nAt the time, I was dumbfounded by this. I read this e-mail out loud to my wife, who also could not believe it.\n\n“It’s almost like we live in an alternate universe,” I said. “We can’t even get our facts straight,” she replied.\n\nI was appalled that people actually believe the President signed off on the death penalty. Did these women not know that President Obama, along with most other liberal politicians, is against the death penalty?\n\nIf these two women were so misinformed as to believe the President ordered the death penalty for the Fort Hood shooter, what other misinformed beliefs do they have? Could they believe that President Bush caused the current economic crisis? Could they believe that Obama passed Obamacare? Or that he killed Osama Bin Laden?\n\nIf they believe this then it might be possible that they also believe in evolution, too.\n\nIf they’re ignorant enough to believe in evolution, then how could they not believe in that President Obama is a Muslim, when he was raised by a Muslim stepfather? If these people are that misinformed as to believe that President Obama is a Muslim, then how could they not believe in global warming?\n\nI’m not trying to be funny, I’m trying to highlight how important it is for our mainstream media to report the news in an unbiased manner. We should be informing people what is actually happening, not only what is going on in the liberal’s minds.\n\nThese"
"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A man drove a truck into a crowd in the German city of Munich on Friday evening, killing at least nine people in what police said appeared to be a deliberate attack.\n\nThe suspected driver was a German, a police spokesman said.

And while the \"average\" consumer is more likely to complain about price hikes than the intricacies of media consolidation, the impact is nonetheless real: as Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner and countless other regional cable monopolies face less and less competition, the average cost of bundled cable, broadband and phone services has skyrocketed.\n\nBut while the notion of competition bringing down prices is a myth perpetrated by Big Telecom's lobbying organizations, the idea of competition pushing companies to invest in better, more innovative service has been a staple of the telecom sector for over a century. The problem these days is that the companies that provide the Internet service actually making consumers' lives better -- think Google Fiber, Verizon FiOS and municipal broadband projects -- are increasingly a rarity, thanks in large part to this cozy duopoly between the traditional cable and phone giants and the regional duopolies these companies often created.\n\nCase in point: Google Fiber. Once the shining example of what was possible when competitors were allowed to invest in next-generation networks, the service has recently struggled to expand beyond the nation's more affluent cities, a stark contrast to the company's early expansion efforts. And this week, news came out that Google Fiber is likely to soon face a new set of obstacles that could ultimately threaten the service's survival.\n\nThe news began to trickle out Tuesday morning, when an article in the Kansas City Star noted that Google Fiber is likely to change hands and see dramatic shifts in management. Just a few hours later, The Information reported that Google Fiber will soon be led by a former Qualcomm executive named Dennis Kish. The move will effectively kick CEO Craig Barratt (a former Qualcomm exec) upstairs into a new job focused on \"contributing to corporate initiatives.\" The changes are the latest in a series of struggles for the company's expansion efforts.\n\nWhile the move hasn't been formally announced, the Star's report paints a grim picture of the company's future. One anonymous source told the paper that \"the issue was whether or not it [Google Fiber] would ever get built\" and that \"a lot of the plan was based on using existing infrastructure that had already been built, and that's the part that has hit some snags.\"\n\nThose \"snags\" include Google Fiber's use of public, taxpayer-funded rights of way, which, as the Star notes, are often owned by politically influential private companies that enjoy strong relationships with existing ISPs. One local example cited in the article involves the wealthy owner of a baseball team and a very unpopular local ISP (whose executives appear to be no fans of the site).\n\n\"Charter has made it clear that they’re not happy with Google Fiber in the city,\" one local source familiar with the company told the Star. \"They’re an incumbent provider and they don’t like the idea that the city is helping Google come in and potentially take customers away from them.\"\n\nAnd while that's merely a local anecdote, Google Fiber has had to contend with very similar situations in cities like Nashville, where a slow rollout in the face of numerous political roadblocks has resulted in calls for a more open and competitive market in the city. In short, local political forces have been effectively weaponized by incumbent ISPs in the hopes of stymieing the company's efforts to deploy faster, more affordable service.\n\nAnd unfortunately, Google Fiber has also run into problems when it comes to gaining access to existing infrastructure like utility poles, another problem the company faced during its Austin launch.\n\n\"In other cities, Google had relied on existing infrastructure to connect customers to its ultra-fast Internet service,\" the Star notes. \"But the existing poles and other infrastructure here [in Kansas City] were controlled by other telecom providers and cable companies, who refused to"

"If the US supreme court rules in favour of the controversial referendum, it could become one of the most important cases in the recent history of the judicial system.\n\nThe country’s supreme court is set to hear the case on 27 February. And a decision is expected to be reached within months, possibly even before June. If the US supreme court rules in favour of the controversial referendum, it could become one of the most important cases in the recent history of the judicial system.\n\nThe move is a “referendum on the imperial and colonial era of the US that will give more justice and freedom to the world”, according to North Korean state media.\n\nIt is also claimed that the supreme court is likely to accept the case because no less than ten US states have joined in to oppose the situation.\n\nWhile the idea of Washington stepping in to protect the DPRK’s people from its own government is absurd, it remains unclear as to what exactly the DPRK would be able to gain from the situation.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that North Korea does not take any kind of criticism well.\n\nThe Kim regime has on more than one occasion lashed out at the US for attempting to intervene. And while the U.S. cannot be solely responsible for the unfortunate situation that North Koreans find themselves in, they can make a conscious decision to help them.<|endoftext|>As of 2:35 am 24/8/16 EDT\n\nSaturday Partly Cloudy 27° 18° Sunday Clear 28° 18° Monday Clear 26° 15° Tuesday Light Clouds 26° 14° Wednesday Clear 24° 13° Thursday Light Clouds 26° 15° Friday Clear 28° 17°\n\nSaturday - Afternoon Partly Cloudy\n\n27° Wind: E at 10.8 kmh\n\nHumidity: 65.3%\n\nPressure: 1010.5 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 75.8% Saturday - Evening Partly Cloudy\n\n23° Wind: NE at 9.4 kmh\n\nHumidity: 85.6%\n\nPressure: 1011.8 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 89.8% Saturday - Night Light Clouds\n\n18° Wind: E at 13 kmh\n\nHumidity: 68.5%\n\nPressure: 1013.0 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 32.0%\n\nSunday - Morning Clear\n\n22° Wind: E at 10.1 kmh\n\nHumidity: 76.8%\n\nPressure: 1012.1 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 7.8% Sunday - Afternoon Clear\n\n27° Wind: E at 9 kmh\n\nHumidity: 60.8%\n\nPressure: 1011.3 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0% Sunday - Evening Partly Cloudy\n\n22° Wind: NE at 5.8 kmh\n\nHumidity: 79.4%\n\nPressure: 1011.8 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 71.9% Sunday - Night Light Clouds\n\n18° Wind: E at 10.4 kmh\n\nHumidity: 77.9%\n\nPressure: 1013.3 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 15.6%\n\nMonday - Morning Clear\n\n21° Wind: E at 8.3 kmh\n\nHumidity: 75.8%\n\nPressure: 1013.3 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0% Monday - Afternoon Clear\n\n26° Wind: E at 11.9 kmh\n\nHumidity: 52.0%\n\nPressure: 1013.3 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0% Monday - Evening Clear\n\n18° Wind: E at 10.4 kmh\n\nHumidity: 78.3%\n\nPressure: 1014.5 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0% Monday - Night Light Clouds\n\n15° Wind: E at 8.6 kmh\n\nHumidity: 87.4%\n\nPressure: 1014.0 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 18.0%\n\nTuesday - Morning Light Clouds\n\n20° Wind: E at 8.6 kmh\n\nHumidity: 74.6%\n\nPressure: 1014.5 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 16.4% Tuesday - Afternoon Light Clouds\n\n26° Wind: E at 8.6 kmh\n\nHumidity: 44.3%\n\nPressure: 1013.1 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 16.4% Tuesday - Evening Light Clouds\n\n24° Wind: E at 7.9 kmh\n\nHumidity: 53.6%\n\nPressure: 1011.3 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 18.0% Tuesday - Night Partly Cloudy\n\n14° Wind: E at 8.6 kmh\n\nHumidity: 90.1%\n\nPressure: 1013.2 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 62.5%\n\nWednesday - Morning Light Clouds\n\n16° Wind: E at 9 kmh\n\nHumidity: 83.3%\n\nPressure: 1013.7 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 28.1% Wednesday - Afternoon Clear\n\n24° Wind: E at 8.3 kmh\n\nHumidity: 48.4%\n\nPressure: 1012.6 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0% Wednesday - Evening Clear\n\n15° Wind: NE at 3.6 kmh\n\nHumidity: 75.2%\n\nPressure: 1012.8 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0% Wednesday - Night Clear\n\n13° Wind: NE at 5.4 kmh\n\nHumidity: 84.1%\n\nPressure: 1014.6 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0%\n\nThursday - Morning Partly Cloudy\n\n17° Wind: E at 8.6 kmh\n\nHumidity: 85.4%\n\nPressure: 1014.1 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 85.9% Thursday - Afternoon Light Clouds\n\n26° Wind: NE at 7.6 kmh\n\nHumidity: 51.4%\n\nPressure: 1012.1 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 17.2% Thursday - Evening Partly Cloudy\n\n18° Wind: E at 9 kmh\n\nHumidity: 82.0%\n\nPressure: 1011.4 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 42.2% Thursday - Night Clear\n\n16° Wind: E at 9 kmh\n\nHumidity: 92.5%\n\nPressure: 1013.0 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 4.7%\n\nFriday - Morning Partly Cloudy\n\n19° Wind: E at 9.4 kmh\n\nHumidity: 77.2%\n\nPressure: 1013.1 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 79.7% Friday - Afternoon Clear\n\n28° Wind: NE at 7.9 kmh\n\nHumidity: 42.5%\n\nPressure: 1010.6 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0% Friday - Evening Light Clouds\n\n19° Wind: NE at 4.7 kmh\n\nHumidity: 77.4%\n\nPressure: 1011.4 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 17.2% Friday - Night Clear\n\n17° Wind: E at 9.4 kmh\n\nHumidity: 89.5%\n\nPressure: 1013.0 mb\n\nPrecipitation: 0.0 mm\n\nCloud Cover: 0.0%\n\nForecast data from The Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Current conditions data from the National Weather Service\n\nAll historical data and normals © Weatherbase<|endoftext|>Over 50,000 IT professionals have attended the last 15 Cebit shows in Hannover.

Getty Images\n\nThe most decorated soccer club in Europe with a dozen English Premier League titles is on the brink of extinction, according to new reports out of England.\n\nAn investigation by British newspaper The Times says Manchester United is currently trying to find the money to avoid missing a bond interest payment due on July 14, which could lead to a default on the more than $800 million the team owes in loans. The loans are used to pay for a debt pile the team built up when its owners, the Glazer family, bought the team in 2005 in a deal that saddled the team with more than $800 million in debt.\n\nThe U.S. owners are using the money to pay down that debt, according to the report, while looking for an investor to help the team, which is currently a distant second in the EPL behind Chelsea.\n\nFor its part, Manchester United officials called the report inaccurate, saying in a statement that the team has no plans to default. The team has declined to comment further.\n\nManchester United didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat's not the only drama affecting the team right now. The team's star striker, Wayne Rooney, is reportedly trying to get out of his contract with the team by arguing that he was misled when he signed a deal in 2010 that will pay him $25.6 million a year through 2019.\n\nThe team will have to sell Rooney to recoup his current contract if he gets a court to agree to the argument.\n\nFor more on the British soccer team's troubles, check out the full report at The Times.<|endoftext|>[High Praise! to RT]\n\nJapan to develop android robots for Fukushima\n\n“Japan is looking to develop new robots to clean up the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant.

Die veröffentlichten Daten seien dem Unternehmen bereits im Jahr 2005 bekannt gewesen.Bei dem aufgetauchten E-Mail-Verkehr, der sich um ein Sicherheitsloch im E-Mail-Dienst der SRG dreht, handelt es sich um einen echten Datensatz. Jedoch wurden dabei mit gefälschten Daten gearbeitet.

The reason that it's not done, the reason that they have such a low education level, is because there is no legislation allowing women to go and work in the private sector.\n\n\"Women's education is important because they are not allowed to work in the private sector, and if they can't work in the private sector, then they can't get an education,\" she says.\n\n'Domestic violence'\n\nIf the current legal framework is in need of reform, then the treatment of the victim in the eyes of the law is a key problem.\n\nWomen's rights groups here say there is a lack of respect for women and a stigma surrounding their treatment at the hands of the state\n\n\"Victims of violence are very afraid to come forward and seek help because of the shame that they feel that they have,\" says Ms Saeed.\n\nShe describes the perception of the victim, often at the hands of her husband, as \"shaming the family, and you are bringing the family to shame\".\n\n\"So the women themselves don't want to come forward, and they don't want to report,\" she says.\n\nThe attitude of the judiciary towards the victim is an important factor in preventing women from coming forward, says Ms Saeed.\n\n\"The judiciary does not encourage women to come forward, in fact they discourage women from doing so.\n\n\"It doesn't happen every time, but it does happen often, and it's because the judiciary itself doesn't understand what's going on,\" she says.\n\nReligious law\n\nShe believes the separation of the different courts is a cause of concern.\n\n\"In one case you have a criminal case and you have to try it in the criminal court, but if it's a divorce case then it has to go to a different court.

"THE STING OF THE KELPIE\n\n\nby\n\n\nWALTER DE LA MARE\n\n\nF. Warne & Co. Ltd., London\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nTO THYRA, SON OF SIGURD\n\nTHE STING OF THE KELPIE\n\nCALMOT'S HARP\n\nSUMMER AT MOUNT KATTERY\n\nA SECRET\n\nTHE LIE\n\nTHE TIGER\n\nSONGS\n\n\nTO THYRA, SON OF SIGURD\n\n\nThis tale of terror and of grief\n\nOf the kelpie and the lass who dared\n\nTo lift the perilous burden\n\nWhere the kelpie slept beneath the grass,\n\nI dedicate, my son, to thee.\n\n\nTO THYRA, SON OF SIGURD\n\n\nTHE STING OF THE KELPIE\n\n\nKATTERY Island lay far off in the Pacific Ocean. It was shaped like a boat, long and narrow, with a black head and stern, and in the middle, a moorish ridge of hill. A rocky shore encircled it, and from that shore, which broke the waters of the Pacific into clouds of tumbling foam, the island seemed to launch itself upon the sea, and to sail, with masts, and spars, and mainsail spread to the wind.\n\nThe kelpie lived in the shallows of the outer bay. He was a terrible horse-monster, and he came to shore every night to find what he could of food. He could speak, and had learnt a few human words, and he walked with a crab-like motion, sideways. His mouth was large, and full of teeth. His neck was long and swan-like, and he had the body of a horse, covered with shaggy hair. His hoofs were three-clawed, like a bird's.\n\nThere was a long, narrow bay on the seaward side of the island, which was full of fish, and the kelpie came up that bay to eat them. And there was a girl called Martha who lived in a little house on the shore.\n\nMartha lived all alone. Her mother had died when she was a baby, and her father, who was a sailor, had gone to sea when she was still little.\n\nHe never came back. He was lost at sea, and nobody knew whether he was alive or dead.\n\nSo Martha lived in the house alone, and was glad to have no relations, and she did not care if they did not come and see her.\n\nWhen she was very small she used to see the kelpie in the shallows. He frightened her. She was only six years old when she was sent to school. The school was in the village which was on the other side of the island. She was not afraid of the kelpie then, because he did not come to the school. And her cousins came to see her every Sunday, and she was always happy when they were there.\n\nBut they went away, one by one, to go to the High School, and at last only two of them came to see her every Sunday. One was Thyra, her cousin, who was a year younger than herself, and the other was Angus, who was her cousin, too, and was ten years older.\n\nAngus was her father's cousin. He was a tall man, with yellow hair and blue eyes, and his face was weather-beaten. He wore a fisherman's jersey and a pea-jacket. He was the man of all others whom Martha liked to see, and he was the only man she could see every Sunday.\n\nAngus and Thyra used to take Martha to church every Sunday, and afterwards they would sit down to tea.\n\nBut when Martha was nine years old the kelpie came up into the bay, and he stopped behind the fisherman's houses, where the rocks came to the edge of the sea, and there he made a nest of seaweed.\n\nIt was in a cleft of the rocks. The nest was round and deep, and was so strong that you could not pull it to pieces.\n\nIn the middle of the nest was a hole. This was the door of the nest. The kelpie used to sleep inside the nest.\n\nMartha was too young to go to church alone. And she liked to stay at home, for she was always hoping that her father would come back, and she did not want to go to church without him.\n\nSo she was at home every Sunday, and she used to sit at the window and watch the sea.\n\nOne Sunday Angus and Thyra came to the house as usual.\n\nThey brought a message from the minister, who was the clergyman at the village. The minister had a good voice and sang beautifully. He sang in the choir, and sang the tenor. And he loved Martha's father. He loved him, and he loved his little girl. He was a man who thought of others.\n\nAnd he had sent Martha a message, which Angus and Thyra had brought from him.\n\nHe wanted Martha to come to church every Sunday with them, so that he could talk to her and teach her and make her a good girl.\n\nBut Martha could not go. She told them why.\n\n'I am very sorry,' said the minister's message, 'but the minister is obliged to have an assistant to help him, and I want to take your father's place as the assistant minister of the parish. I must ask you to come to church every Sunday. I will come over to see you in the afternoon, and we will read the Bible together, and you will come to me on Monday morning for a lesson. It is my duty to help you. Please obey me.'\n\n'I am very sorry,' said the minister's message, 'but I have to do what the minister says. Please obey him.'\n\nSo Martha was obliged to go.\n\nThe next Sunday she went to church with Angus and Thyra. And after church the minister came to see her. And he came every Sunday afternoon, and read the Bible to her, and on Monday he came at nine o'clock to give her a lesson.\n\nHe used to give Martha a Bible-lesson every day, and it was very good for her, for the minister was a clever man, and he taught her well.\n\nShe learnt the New Testament in the Bible by heart. She was not a clever girl, and the minister had to tell her to do it over and over again.\n\nShe learned the Ten Commandments by heart, and the catechism, and the little prayer-book that the minister had given her, with prayers in it which every good child had to know by heart.\n\nIt was a long time before the minister began to teach Martha anything new. But at last he thought that she was old enough.\n\nSo one Sunday afternoon he took her to the top of a little hill which was above the village.\n\nIt was the very highest point of the island, and was bare of trees, and the sea was round about it.\n\nThe minister showed Martha all the isles of the sea, and she looked over a great distance to where the mainland was, and the mountains and the sky, and she felt happy.\n\nThe minister was very happy, too, for he loved his parish.\n\nHe loved Martha, and he loved his work.\n\nHe told her many things about God, and about his work in the parish.\n\nBut when he had been there with her for a little while, and had finished what he had to say, he told Martha that she must now kneel down, and she must pray to God to help her.\n\nShe was surprised, for she had not expected this, and she had never prayed.\n\n'What shall I say?' she asked the minister.\n\n'You must thank God for giving you a good father, who was a Christian, and who taught you to read the Bible,' he said. 'You must thank God that you were so young when your father died that you could remember him. You must ask God to make you like your father, and you must pray that you will be good.'\n\nSo Martha kneeled down, and she thanked God for giving her a good father, and she asked God to make her like her father, and she prayed to God to make her good.\n\nAnd after that she went home, and the minister came the next day, as usual.\n\nShe could not go to church again with Angus and Thyra, because she had to be at home every Sunday afternoon, and she had to have her Bible-lesson every day.\n\nShe thought that she would not mind. She liked the minister, and he had been very kind to her.\n\nBut she found that she missed going to church.\n\nShe used to sit at the window and look across the sea, and the time seemed very long when she had no one to talk to but the minister, and no one to play with but the minister.\n\nAnd although the minister was good and kind, he was not very merry.\n\nHe was an old man, and he had little sense of fun, and he had a trick of remembering little things which he did not like.\n\nSo that Martha used to have a sort of melancholy feeling when she was at home with him.\n\nAnd after that she did not like being alone so much as she had done.\n\nSometimes she used to sit on the rocks by the sea, and she thought of her father, and she wished that"

The competition in the tobacco market is so high that many companies are even looking at electronic cigarettes as the best alternative for traditional cigarette. Many e-cigarette producers do claim that their product is the best in the market, but how can one be sure of the benefits of using e-cigarettes? A little bit of research on the different e-cigarettes available in the market is all it takes to understand the best e-cigarette to purchase. But it is always a good idea to purchase a e-cigarette that is known to be the best. When looking for a tobacco alternative, it is best to go for the product that does not contain tobacco. Tobacco smoke is harmful and can lead to cancer, heart problems and other respiratory disorders. The best alternative for tobacco smokers is to switch to a product that contains nicotine, but no tobacco. E-cigarettes come with many varieties, some containing nicotine and some without. It is always a good idea to go for an e-cigarette that contains no nicotine. This will help to curb the urge of the nicotine in the body. The best e-cigarette that is available in the market comes with an easy to use system. The product is also easy to carry around and contains a good battery that does not need to be recharged often. Since e-cigarettes do not have tobacco, it will not have the same smell and taste that a traditional cigarette has. However, the quality of the smoke is still the same. Many consumers of e-cigarettes have also complained about the lack of flavor in the smoke. The companies manufacturing the best e-cigarettes have tried to address this issue. It is a good idea to look for e-cigarettes that offer different flavors, such as mint, chocolate, vanilla and many more. When buying an e-cigarette, it is always a good idea to choose a product that is made from the best material and with the best quality. There are many companies that have started producing poor quality e-cigarettes, but with the rise of many websites providing information on e-cigarettes, it is not difficult to find the best product in the market.\n\nElectronic Cigarettes- What You Need to Know A modern electronic cigarette is made to resemble a traditional cigarette. There are two main types of electronic cigarettes, each of which contains a nicotine cartridge. The majority of the e-cigarettes come with cartridges that contain the nicotine. While it is easy to distinguish the nicotine cartridges, it can be difficult to identify the cartridges that do not have the nicotine in it. A nicotine cartridge is similar to a traditional cigarette. This means that it has a filter and a tip at the end. Many e-cigarettes also come with an atomizer, which is a mechanism that vaporizes the liquid that is contained in the cartridge. These atomizers are then heated by a battery to produce the smoke. It is usually recommended that e-cigarette users purchase an e-cigarette with a battery and a charger. This way the users do not have to worry about charging the battery of the e-cigarette. As electronic cigarettes have many benefits, it is usually recommended that tobacco smokers switch to them. Electronic cigarettes are safer than traditional cigarettes and have many health benefits as well. One of the benefits of electronic cigarettes is that they do not have tobacco. A major cause of cancer is tobacco, so not having the ingredient means that you will have a healthier life. The e-cigarettes also have the advantage of being cheaper than traditional cigarettes. It has been reported that an average electronic cigarette cartridge is cheaper than a traditional pack of cigarettes. However, it is always a good idea to research more on this as the prices do differ from one seller to another. One of the main benefits of electronic cigarettes is that they do not contain tar and other harmful chemicals that are contained in traditional cigarettes. With an electronic cigarette, you will be inhaling the smoke through the atomizer and will not be burning tobacco. This means that the e-cigarette will have a cleaner taste. The taste of the electronic cigarette smoke is also stronger and better than the traditional cigarette. You will also be able to easily customize your e-cigarette and choose from a variety of flavors that are offered in the market. Electronic cigarettes are also a great way to fight smoking. As they look and taste like traditional cigarettes, it is easy to slowly wean yourself off the tobacco addiction. The e-cigarettes can also be used as a way to quit smoking.<|endoftext|>“You did an amazing job! You were so easy to work with. You have such a great personality and it made the day fun.

Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan sitä, onko Suomen sisäiset tai ulkoiset muuttojaallot vaikuttaneet Suomen nuorten miesten ja naisten väkivaltaiseen käyttäytymiseen.\n\nTulosten mukaan naisten miehistä riippumattoman väkivallan yleisyys on pysynyt jokseenkin samalla tasolla (noin 1 % vuodessa), mutta yhdeksän vuoden aikana Suomen naisista kokonaisuudessaan tehtyjen ilmoitusten määrä kuitenkin nousi, eli väkivalta naisista riippuvaisissa parisuhteissa on yleistynyt.\n\nSamaan aikaan myös maahanmuuttajanaisten tekemien ilmoitusten määrä kasvoi merkittävästi, eli Suomen maahanmuuttajataustaiset nuoret naiset eivät ole vähentäneet väkivaltaista käyttäytymistään Suomessa ollessaan. Miehistä riippumattoman väkivallan yleisyys ei ole juuri muuttunut suomalaisissa nuorissa miehissä.\n\nEri maista muuttaneiden eri ikäisten suomalaisten nuorten miesten väkivaltaisuudessa ei ole havaittu huomattavia eroja, mutta koulujen eri oppilasrakenteessa ja koulutussektorin koulutustason vaihtelussa voi olla merkittävä vaikutus. Koulutussektorin vaikutusta voidaan tarkastella kuviosta.\n\nKoulutussektorin vaihtelu vaikuttaa väkivallan määrään selvästi: korkeasti koulutetut suomalaiset nuoret naiset ja miehet (yläkoulu ja ammatillinen tutkinto) tekevät vähemmän ilmoituksia kuin vähemmän koulutetut.\n\nNaisten ja miesten väkivaltatapausten määrän ero on kasvanut erityisesti maahanmuuttajanaisten osalta, koska maahanmuuttajien ryhmässä on enemmän väkivaltaa kuin kantaväestössä.

That may not sound like much, but that’s enough time to increase the risk of a crash by nearly 400 percent.\n\nMusic can alter the way you drive.\n\nWith loud music and loud passengers, some drivers tend to push the limits to keep up. A University of Nebraska study of 20 teen drivers found that they drive more aggressively and take more risks when their music is loud and they’re accompanied by passengers.\n\nOther studies have found that drivers listening to loud music pay less attention to signs and signals, and they tend to drive faster.\n\nIn a 1999 study published in the journal Ergonomics, University of Texas researcher James Anderson played a series of music selections to participants while asking them to perform various driving tasks. The music they heard ranged from classical to heavy metal and was played at various decibel levels. The subjects were tested while driving in a simulator, and again while performing the same tasks while walking. The drivers were better at driving tasks when there was no music, or when the music was played at a low level. They performed worse when the music was loud or when it interfered with their driving ability.\n\nTurn it down.\n\nWhile there are lots of good reasons to keep the music down while you’re driving, the most important one may be that loud music interferes with your ability to hear other sounds.\n\nIn a 1993 study by the University of Southampton in England, researchers found that car drivers wearing headphones and listening to music at a level of 100 decibels couldn’t hear a fire engine’s siren until it was less than 40 meters away. That’s a big distance to be missing a siren, especially if you’re driving fast.\n\nWhat should you listen to?\n\nAny music you play in your car has the potential to distract you from what’s going on around you, but researchers say there are some types of music that are more distracting than others.\n\nA study by Frank Drews of the University of Munich in Germany, published in Applied Cognitive Psychology in 2000, found that music with a fast tempo and heavy bass line is the most distracting. Other studies have found that music with words is more distracting than instrumental music.<|endoftext|>As the high level of sexual harassment continues to be exposed in the workplace, one Reddit user posted a list of questions that men should be asking themselves.\n\nThe advice was shared in response to a Reddit thread on r/TwoXChromosomes which asked users about their most harrowing tales of workplace harassment.\n\nThe list was posted by a man who said he wanted to check himself.\n\nThis is the list:\n\n'Have I been participating in sexist or derogatory conversations about women?'

He’s received threats from racists.\n\nAndrew Gillum says he's had death threats as a result of being the Democratic frontrunner for Florida governor https://t.co/XkAZqw1uPO pic.twitter.com/E9FV1eZxUq — CNN (@CNN) March 10, 2018\n\nGillum pointed out the subtle racism that he’s encountered as he’s risen in the ranks of politics in Florida.\n\n“I’ve had people call me a monkey,” Gillum said. “I’ve had people call me a skunk. I’ve had people call me a coon. I’ve had people talk about my body parts in ways that they shouldn’t.”\n\nGillum also pointed out that he had been “a target of racists.”\n\nThe mayor said it’s time to stand up against the racism that is plaguing the state of Florida.\n\n“When we decided to stand up to the NRA and we started talking about a ban on assault weapons, that we would be called racist, that was the part that bothered me the most,” Gillum said. “I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of that. I’m tired of the silence of good people.”\n\nAnd Gillum is more than ready to be the next Democratic governor of Florida.\n\n“It’s time for the same energy that we brought to taking back our state House and our state Senate and our governor’s mansion,” he said. “It’s time to bring that same energy to take back our country.”\n\nWatch:<|endoftext|>A 27-year-old man has died after a suspected one-punch attack in Dublin.\n\nThe man was assaulted in an alleyway at North Great Georges Street in Dublin city centre at about 2.30am on Sunday.\n\nHe had to be resuscitated at the scene and was rushed to St James's Hospital, where he later died.\n\nThe man, who has been named as Kenneth O'Brien, from Ballyfermot in Dublin, had been living at the Ozanam House homeless hostel on Aungier Street.\n\nA man has been arrested and is being detained at Pearse Street Garda station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act.\n\nA postmortem on Mr O'Brien's body is due to take place later today.\n\nGardaí have appealed for witnesses to contact Pearse Street Garda station on 01-6668000, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any garda station.<|endoftext|>× Expand Illustration by Andrew Archer\n\nOn December 8, around 30 black-clad demonstrators gathered outside New Scotland Yard in London.\n\nThey were there to denounce what they claim was the unjust killing of 27-year-old Edir Frederico Da Costa, a black man who died on June 21 after being stopped and searched by Metropolitan Police officers in Newham. He had reportedly swallowed drugs and was trying to avoid police.\n\nDa Costa's family told the press that he died of a heart attack. In August, an inquest into his death was opened and adjourned. His family have vowed to take legal action against the police.\n\nThe protest on December 8, which took place after a London Black Lives Matter (BLM) meeting, was small compared to a March for Justice held the previous month. But the small group of protesters who showed up outside the London Metropolitan Police headquarters have since lodged a formal complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission.\n\n\"We were there to make our feelings known that we don't feel safe and we don't feel protected,\" says Mina Abdul-Aziz, one of the activists who was outside the Met that night.\n\nThe Met insists Da Costa's death is being independently investigated.\n\n\"It is essential that the facts are established,\" the Met said in a statement. \"We are aware of concerns raised by some members of the public and the Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the circumstances of this incident.\"\n\nThe protest was organized by the Newham People's Alliance, a coalition of anti-racism groups based in East London, and followed a meeting of BLMUK – a national group separate from the US-founded movement. The December protest also doubled as a launch for the People's Alliance's new campaign, \"Safer Together,\" which will document cases of police brutality in the borough of Newham, a largely black and Asian part of East London.\n\nWhile the US-based BLM has garnered support from celebrities and white liberals, the group's London wing has had a harder time garnering support from members of the black community. While some have criticized the movement for being too white and too middle class, others say the group has not yet found its feet.\n\nMichele Sparks, a founding member of BLMUK, is determined to change that.\n\n\"The BLMUK project is an urgent one. The US [movement] has woken us up to the realities that black people in this country face. And we're really keen to see a movement here that looks a lot different,\" she says.\n\nLondon's chapter of BLM first began to make waves on February 28, when a small group of black activists, supported by Londoners from the Ethical Society, gathered outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square to protest against police killings of unarmed black men in the US.\n\nThat protest, which was held during the Oscars ceremony, ended with a confrontation between activists and white people who shouted racist and homophobic abuse at the activists.\n\nThe confrontations highlighted divisions within the movement. The ensuing media storm overshadowed BLMUK's bigger goals: to hold police accountable for alleged abuse, to take a stand against Britain's anti-terror policies, and to support the creation of safe spaces for black people.\n\nFounded in May 2015, BLMUK is a loose coalition of community activists, activists of color, and students. The group is working to bring more people into the fold.\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges is getting more of a critical mass to come to our meetings and participate in the movement,\" says Sparks.\n\nSparks, who works as a freelance TV producer, is part of a subgroup that focuses on media. She helped to organize BLMUK's first national conference, which took place on October 29 in Leeds, and the group's first action on December 8.\n\nAnother group within the movement, focused on advocacy, works to bring new people into the fold.\n\n\"I've been surprised by the level of response,\" says Mike Stuchbery, a freelance writer who founded BLMUK's advocacy group. \"People are keen to get involved.\"\n\nStuchbery says the response has been positive, though the group's first post on its Facebook page garnered a slew of racist comments.\n\nSome critics have accused the London BLM of only taking action on behalf of black lives when they are taken overseas.\n\nOthers have questioned why the movement isn't taking a more hardline stance against the police.\n\n\"They don't seem to be brave enough to stand up to the police,\" says Ishmahil Blagrove, who co-founded the Independent Police Complaints Commission-backed campaign #"
"Instead of clashing against national adversaries, the 2014 Sochi Olympics will have a more international focus than usual. The Olympic events include representatives from nations that are notoriously difficult to connect with, such as North Korea.\n\nThe Olympics are not the only global event coming up in 2014. Others include:\n\nPolitical changes in the Middle East (including elections in Libya and Iraq)\n\nThailand’s political upheaval\n\nVenezuela’s violent clashes\n\nThe Super Bowl\n\n2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia\n\nOngoing political conflict in Ukraine\n\nKorea’s succession of power\n\nAfghanistan’s presidential election\n\nIndia’s general elections\n\nThe release of the new “Star Wars” movie\n\nAthletic competitions at the Commonwealth Games\n\nNaval standoff between India and China over the South China Sea\n\nEconomic conflicts between the U.S. and Russia\n\nWho will win the “no-holds-barred” brawl for control of Crimea?\n\nUnrest in Iraq\n\nMiss America\n\nFifty Shades of Grey\n\nHockey and figure skating at the Winter Olympics\n\nExpect these events to have both positive and negative effects on the global economy and security. The Olympics will likely promote cooperation and stability in a region that is currently experiencing political and economic uncertainty. But North Korea is known for staging provocative actions, so there is always the potential for disruption.\n\nThe Super Bowl is often used as a barometer of the U.S. economy because it generates huge amounts of revenue. The World Cup may not have the same influence, but it is also a huge event that brings together nations around the world to play a game.\n\nThe country’s response to political change in Egypt during the Arab Spring, which initially boosted stock markets, was a notable economic example of the power of international relations.\n\nPolitical and social tensions between India and Pakistan over disputed territories could also escalate and adversely affect the security of the region.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have major sanctions on Iran, but these measures have not yet significantly affected the country’s economy. Even so, Iran’s leader warned of dire consequences if the U.S. imposes new sanctions. Iran’s economy could be badly damaged if additional sanctions were placed on its oil exports.\n\nIt is also possible that Saudi Arabia, which has a strong interest in keeping oil prices low, could push Iran out of the global energy market, which could send oil prices higher.\n\nWhile these international events should be closely monitored for potential disruptions to economic stability, the developments also have the potential to be a positive influence on the global economy.\n\nThe election in Afghanistan will be another political development that has the potential to influence the country’s economic stability. There are a number of warlords, including some with close ties to the Taliban, who could benefit from the power shift.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Star Wars movie, which could be another blockbuster, will boost consumer spending in the United States and other countries. It is also likely to spawn more toy sales.\n\nSome countries could be harmed by the release of the movie. China, for example, could ban its citizens from going to see the movie because of the country’s strict restrictions on the kinds of content that can be shown in its theaters.\n\nThe impact of the film’s release will not be limited to the countries that are named above. It will be interesting to see how well the movie performs in many countries around the world. The film could spur a lot of tourism, especially in Europe, which will benefit the tourism industry in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nOne of the biggest economic events of 2014 will be the impending clash between the United States and the European Union over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn the other hand, if a negotiated solution can be reached between the U.S. and the EU, the sanctions on Russia could be eased or even lifted, which would have a positive effect on the global economy.\n\nThis is because the EU buys a significant amount of Russian oil. If the EU imposes additional sanctions on Russia, the price of oil could rise.\n\nGlobal Unrest in 2014\n\nSome other international events to watch in 2014 include:\n\n(For more about the global unrest in 2014, click here.)\n\nIs the Russian economy in crisis? It could be. It depends on the results of the conflict with the Ukraine, the loss of energy exports to Europe and how the sanctions that have already been imposed will affect the country’s economy.\n\nFor the global economy, however, the most serious potential risk is the naval standoff between India and China over the South China Sea. If the conflict escalates, the Asian economy could be hit hard.\n\nOther than that, the biggest impact on the global economy in 2014 will be the numerous domestic economic issues that need to be addressed. These include the political stalemate in Washington, high unemployment, low wage growth and other problems.\n\nStay informed about the issues that affect you the most.

Emphasis is placed on the relationship between military organization, including the technology of war, and military methods on the one hand and political ideas, economic developments, and technological change on the other. It also argues that it is impossible to understand the military history of the Anglo-American world during this period without a knowledge of what was happening in the other three quarters of the world, a point of view which will be developed in the second volume.\n\nNoel Malcolm uses examples from the Dutch Revolt, the English Civil Wars, and the American Civil War, as well as those from Scotland, France, India, and the West Indies.<|endoftext|>Name: Origin Ragnorok Online\n\nStatus: Active\n\nRegistered: 2016-02-24\n\nCreator:\n\nPoints: 2 (Win 0 , Lose 0 )\n\nDescription:\n\nRagnorok Online is a MMORPG based on Norse mythology.

"New research by a team of psychologists at The University of Texas at Austin suggests that remembering to take a prescribed drug in the future can be strengthened if individuals are able to actively do something in the present that helps them remember.\n\nThe findings of the study, published in the June issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, suggest that performing an action in the present that is associated with the future event could help people to remember to perform the action when it is needed.\n\n\"It's a little counter-intuitive,\" says Dr. Andrew Butler, a UT-Austin professor of psychology who co-authored the paper with UT-Austin graduate students Olivia Munoz and Meredith Coles. \"Normally we think of actions as something that you do in the future. But here, performing an action that would remind someone to do something in the future actually helps them remember to do it in the future.\"\n\nThe study suggests that performing an action in the present to facilitate remembering in the future might be applied to remembering any kind of event, ranging from exercising to attending medical appointments, or doing chores around the house.\n\n\"If you're a person with Type II diabetes and you have to take your insulin, a good way to remember is to take a dose of insulin now that you will remember to take your medication at a later time,\" says Munoz. \"This study suggests that if you do something in the present that is a cue to remembering, you will remember better.\n\n\"You're building a mental association between the action in the present and a future event. As a result, when you perform that action in the future, you will remember.\"\n\nThe team tested the theory on 40 participants, asking them to remember to complete certain tasks later on.\n\nEach participant was asked to complete a series of \"cued recall\" tasks. They were presented with a series of visual patterns and were asked to recall which of the patterns had been presented. They then were presented with the same series of patterns, with the instructions that this time, they should perform a physical action in response to each pattern they recalled.\n\n\"This was the active task that we gave the participants, and we were varying the timing,\" Munoz says. \"In some of the tasks, we told the participants that the active task would cue them to the visual pattern and that they would recall it after they performed the active task. In other trials, we told them that the task would cue them to recall, but that they would not perform the task.\"\n\nAfter all of the participants performed the task, they were presented with another series of visual patterns. Each pattern would be followed by the same series of four actions. The participants were then asked to recall which action went with which pattern.\n\nThe results were as expected: Participants who performed a task that helped them to remember the patterns performed better on the cued recall than those who were told that the task was simply to remind them of the pattern.\n\n\"The people who performed the active task remembered more patterns than those who just passively recalled the patterns. It seemed that performing the action helped them to remember.\"<|endoftext|>Indo-European Lexicon\n\nPIE Etymon and IE Reflexes\n\nBelow we display: a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) etymon adapted from Pokorny, with our own English gloss; our Semantic Field assignment(s) for the etymon, linked to information about the field(s) ; an optional Comment; and Reflexes (derived words) in various Indo-European languages, organized by family/group in west-to-east order where Germanic is split into West/North/East families and English, our language of primary emphasis, is artificially separated from West Germanic.

"Maybe you have heard about HOMESTEAD, Florida, but you may not have visited. Located about 20 minutes south of Miami, this city is most famous for the Homestead Air Force Base. However, after the Base was shut down in the early 1990’s, the city has been diversifying its economy. It now has the world’s largest garbage transfer station, a Walmart, and a Whole Foods Market.\n\nIt’s the home of South Florida Raceway, an outstanding place to take a few rides on a motorcycle. A friend of mine and I made the three hour trip from West Palm Beach, and we were not disappointed. The track was built in 1968 and designed for high speed. It has a 14 foot banked turn and numerous skid pads to practice your sport riding skills. We spent a couple of hours with our motorcycles in the corners. It was a blast!\n\nTo learn more about the track, go to South Florida Raceway.\n\nJust north of the raceway is the town of Sweetwater. This is where you can enjoy some of the best live music in South Florida. Sweetwater is a small city and most of the businesses have closed. I did notice a few bars and a motorcycle shop, but other than that, it’s pretty much a ghost town. However, if you love music, this is the place to be.\n\nOnce a month, you can see up to 20 bands at The Stage. They have six different music genres from rock, country, R & B, punk, reggae, and classic rock. On April 29, 2018, there was a great lineup that included Southern Avenue, Kyle Park, and Third Eye Blind.\n\nTo learn more about The Stage, go to Sweetwater.\n\nAbout 30 miles south of Homestead is South Beach. This is one of the most visited locations in the country, but it is hard to find a nice affordable hotel. The Hyatt is nice but I could only find two rooms available at the time of our visit. If you can’t get a room there, you might try to find a room on the ocean side of the Intracoastal Waterway. At the time of my visit, the average price for a room was $475.\n\nIt is very difficult to find a good meal for a good price. We stopped at the Stache Gastropub. We really liked this place, but the prices are high. For two dinners, two drinks, and two desserts, we paid $135. I thought it was a bit too much, but I have a wife who is a vegetarian. I don’t know how many vegetarian meals I can get her.\n\nIf you don’t mind spending more, my wife told me about a restaurant called Oasis. It was a great place and they even had a vegetarian menu. The food was excellent.\n\nTo learn more about South Beach, go to Visit Miami Beach.\n\nWe were in Miami for three days and we did a lot of sightseeing. If you would like to see the pictures, go to Pictures of Miami.\n\nIf you have never been to Miami, you are missing out on one of the great cities in the country. If you have been to Miami, you know that there is a lot to do there. If you are going to be in the Miami area, be sure to stop at Homestead and visit the music festival. You can even take a day trip to South Beach.\n\nRemember, the nice people you meet along the way make the journey so much more enjoyable.<|endoftext|>The video will start in 8 Cancel\n\nGet the biggest daily stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nCoronation Street stars Kate Ford and Michael Le Vell are getting married, the couple have announced.\n\nFord, 35, who plays Corrie's feisty Weatherfield cabbie, Faye Windass, and Le Vell, 54, who plays the much-loved character of Kevin Webster, announced their engagement with a picture of them in their wedding outfits.\n\nLe Vell captioned the image: \"Faye Faye Faye #herewego #levellthevellyvellyinlevellivello\"\n\nA Coronation Street spokesperson said: \"We are very pleased for them both.\"\n\nFord first appeared on the cobbles in 2006 and is one of only two original cast members left.\n\nThe news comes after Le Vell announced last year he was facing trial after being accused of raping a child under 16.\n\nHe was cleared after a trial earlier this year.<|endoftext|>Whittier College\n\nPAE-400: Presidential Studies\n\nFall 2011 Section: 01\n\nCourse Pathway: State & Local Government - Leadership\n\nCourse Components: Lecture, Independent Study\n\nCourse Description:\n\nIn this class, we will consider the characteristics of the good president. Among the most important of these are: executive competence, political skill, integrity, communication ability, energy and endurance, personality, and the ability to inspire. In this course, students will review the careers of five modern American presidents who are generally regarded as successful, and consider why they achieved their successes. These presidents include: Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. For each president, we will consider the strengths and weaknesses of the president's personal, political, and administrative leadership skills, and how these characteristics contributed to their success as president.

Speaking from the Sun Valley Resort in Idaho, Hillary Clinton laid out her economic vision for the country in detail. It was a long, passionate call for more progressive policies, and a blistering critique of the Republican Party’s economic plan. She hit the GOP on their lack of policies for helping the middle class, the rich, the poor, and immigrants. She also called out the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy as a “disaster” that has led to budget deficits and a weak economy. Here are some highlights from the speech.\n\nWhile the administration’s prescription is this: first, do nothing; second, let’s cut taxes more; third, let’s deregulate even more; fourth, let’s export even more; fifth, let’s outsource even more, what I think we should do is look to the enduring American values we all share as a people—hard work, individual responsibility, personal initiative, getting ahead by merit and motivation—and apply them to the problems of today.\n\nRead the rest at MSNBC.com<|endoftext|>Provenance\n\nThrough MFA gift, 1925\n\nThis identification is uncertain as the work was not catalogued in the exhibition that took place in 1925.

Both are felonies. A lesser charge of attempted second-degree robbery was dismissed.\n\nThe jury deliberated for about five hours before reaching the verdict.\n\nProsecutors said that last June, Hunter and three accomplices forced their way into a house in the 13000 block of Southeast 212th Street, held the three adults inside at gunpoint and ransacked the house.\n\nOne of the men, prosecutors said, then led the woman who owned the house to her garage where he told her to take her keys and go with him in her Mercedes Benz SUV.\n\nThe woman, a 44-year-old mother of four, complied and was later released. She testified at Hunter’s trial.\n\nProsecutors said Hunter’s accomplice abandoned the Mercedes in another neighborhood. A witness came forward and told police what he saw. Police tracked down the car and found Hunter inside it with a pistol.\n\nThe defendant told police she knew the Mercedes had been stolen but said she didn’t know it was a stolen car. She said she went into the house because her partner had been shot and she was looking for a place to hide him. She claimed the gun she had was hers and that she had it for protection.\n\nHunter"

Simply remove the cord from the base and attach to a door or fence and then wind it up.\n\nI had a couple of issues with the AutoReel, however.\n\nIt takes two hands to get the cord up to the door, so there's no way to easily wind it back up by yourself.\n\nThis is easily remedied by adding a hook to your garage door or fence, but it's still a little annoying.\n\nIn addition, the handle is very short (24\") and the cord was a bit hard to pull back and rewind.\n\nWhat can it be used for?\n\nThe system has three options for use.\n\nFirst, and most obviously, is for regular shooting.\n\nIt can also be used as a way to rebound the ball from a stationary position without having to chase after it.\n\nLastly, the cord can be set up at different lengths for different heights.\n\nThis is perfect for younger kids who need to shoot over shorter distances, or for older kids who need to work on long-distance shots.\n\nWho is it for?\n\nThis is a great system for players of all ages. It will easily help kids who are struggling with their shooting mechanics get the fundamentals down.\n\nSince the cord can be set up at different lengths, it will also work for all ages. It's a great system for any parent who wants to keep their kids off the computer.\n\nAny concerns?\n\nI had a few issues with the system, but none that are serious enough to stop me from recommending it.\n\nThe handles are a little small and hard to pull back and rewind.\n\nThe cord is a little heavy and hard to pull back and rewind.\n\nThe AutoReel is also quite bulky compared to a traditional, portable hoop.\n\nAnything else I should know?\n\nThis hoop is a great option for older kids who might want to shoot in the driveway when it's too cold or wet to shoot on a regulation hoop.\n\nIt's also perfect for any adult who wants to work on their form without having to set up a full-size hoop.<|endoftext|>Mental Health Support\n\nWhen the pressures and challenges of life become too much for you, our counsellors can offer a confidential and supportive space in which to talk.

A tall, trim, 62-year-old man, he has spent most of his life as a warrior on behalf of victims of sexual abuse, children with special needs, people in poverty, and – more recently – the LGBTQ community. For the past six years, he has been the host of the weekly podcast, Somebody’s Gotta Do It, and his work has helped create a safer world for many.

En cas de conseil municipal, cette indemnité est maintenue à sa valeur actuelle jusqu’au 30 septembre, mais passera ensuite de 1.100 € à 993 € par mois, à laquelle s’ajoutera un montant forfaitaire de 200 € à payer mensuellement. En cas d’absence, le montant de l’indemnité sera réduit à 70% du montant total de la rémunération.\n\nUne indemnité de départ\n\nLors du débat qui a précédé le vote, la maire et les élus ont souhaité prendre en compte le travail de tous les conseillers municipaux depuis la création du territoire de la cité à l’arche, qui regroupe les communes de Saint-Savinien, Saint-Mesmin et Rives. C’est ainsi qu’ils ont demandé et obtenu le maintien de leur indemnité à la valeur du 1er septembre 2016. Le maire a également souhaité que les élus bénéficient d’une indemnité de départ, qui sera calculée à la fin du mandat, prévue au 30 septembre 2019. Enfin, l’article 3 du règlement intérieur du conseil municipal, qui prévoit la réduction des indemnités en cas de départ d’un élu ou de son remplacement, a été supprimé.\n\nLes mesures annoncées prévoient également que la réduction sera progressive. Les indemnités seront donc maintenues à leur valeur actuelle jusqu’au 30 septembre, pour la dernière séance du conseil municipal de cette année, puis le 1er octobre, le montant passera à 1.000 €. Le montant pourra être réduit en cas de non-présence.\n\nCes nouvelles règles interviennent dans un contexte de grève dans les municipalités de France. Alors que le projet de loi sur la moralisation de la vie publique vient d’être soumis au vote de l’Assemblée nationale, qui a validé dans une partie les amendements déposés par le député et maire UDI de Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux, Jérôme Chartier, les élus des territoires intercommunaux qui se sont engagés dans la démarche de l’article 73 du Code général des collectivités territoriales ont été réunis en préfecture à Saint-Etienne le 19 octobre dernier. L’objectif de la préfecture était de réaffirmer la légalité de la méthode retenue pour la création de territoires de grande ampleur (TGA). Dans un contexte où les maires de ces territoires devront réduire leurs indemnités de fonctionnement de 30% jusqu’à la fin du mandat, la mairie de Saint-Savinien avait été dans l’obligation d’aller à la préfecture de Saint-Etienne, où elle avait reçu un message rassurant.\n\nAvec la rédaction d’Anaïs Vasseur.<|endoftext|>Image zoom Sony Pictures\n\nWonder Wheel 12/1/17 type Movie Genre Drama\n\nNot even James Cordon is immune to Hollywood’s snowballing sexual harassment and abuse scandal.\n\nThe Late Late Show host and filmmaker has been accused of making lewd jokes to a woman while working on 2011’s My Week With Marilyn, with the accuser going so far as to say Cordon’s alleged actions were “a form of sexual assault.”\n\nAccording to The Guardian, during a private meeting, Cordon made “several explicit remarks” toward the woman, telling her that she would “have to watch him masturbate.” The publication describes the encounter as a “sustained attack,” with the woman’s name withheld. Cordon is said to have been repeatedly aggressive in his remarks toward the woman and is accused of placing her in “fear for her safety.”\n\nFollowing the report, Cordon took to Twitter, denying any allegations. “It’s understandably shocking for someone to read about such behavior in 2017,” he wrote. “I was very surprised by these claims.”\n\n“I still have no idea who this woman is,” he continued. “When we were on set, she was always polite and respectful.”\n\n“I am a gay man.

A responsibility to all the people who are dreaming about the same world, the world of justice and equality for all the people of the world.\n\nDuring his speech, President Obama mentioned the name of the Prophet (PBUH).

This is the first game in the series that takes on subjects that the majority of adults would find extremely challenging. Questions in the game are based on adult topics that are really hard to answer such as IT terms, drug related trivia and much more. It is also the first game in the series to not be based on the national curriculum as the questions in this game are based on the adult knowledge you will have acquired in your life.\n\n\n\nThe game is all about challenge and with that it is meant for adults and older kids. The game starts out with a difficulty meter which will indicate whether the player is ready for the game or not. The game is broken down into three different parts with the first being a sort of trivia. The questions come in a random order and it is up to the player to answer them. The questions are not like the ones you might have seen in the national curriculum tests where there is always one correct answer. There can be multiple answers to a question and there can even be multiple questions that are related to the same topic.\n\n\n\nThe second part of the game is the quiz. The questions come in a random order and once again it is up to the player to answer them. For every question answered correctly, the player is awarded points. The game is split into 3 rounds. At the end of the round the player gets a break which is indicated by a green banner. The green banner also indicates that the player is on the right track. The more rounds the player passes, the harder the questions get.\n\n\n\nThe last part of the game is the \"Speed Round\". The questions here come in a random order and once again it is up to the player to answer them. The player gets 60 seconds to answer the questions. The green banner that indicated the player is doing well is replaced with a red banner that indicates that the player is running out of time. For every question answered correctly, the player is awarded points.\n\n\n\nThis game is all about challenge and the player needs to accept that and not get frustrated with it. Getting the right answer to the question is more important than how long it takes to answer it.\n\n\n\nThe graphics in the game are what we are used to seeing in other \"Brain Quest\" games and as usual, they are high quality. The sound is great and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\n\n\nThis game is all about challenge and it is meant for adults and older kids. This is a game for the thinking adults who would like to have a bit of fun by testing their knowledge.\n\n\n\nTitle: Brain Quest - Hard at Work\n\nDeveloper: \"All in Play Inc\"\n\nGenre: Board Game/Quiz\n\nPlayers: 1\n\nMemory Blocks: 128KB (32 Blocks)\n\nFree Play: Yes\n\nJoystick: Interface 2\n\nSkill Levels: 3\n\nReviewer: Chris Gill\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\nPlayability\n\nLastability\n\nOverall\n\nN/A53%45%52%50%\n\nIf you are the kind of person that likes to test your knowledge in front of others then this game is perfect for you.<|endoftext|>Publikacja: 8 października 2013, 15:40 Autor: Radosław Stawniak\n\nMimo braku formalnej promocji, popularny wśród użytkowników smartfonów czteroletni system operacyjny Google Android, na szczytach list sprzedaży wpływowego dla producentów tabletek dziesiątego miesiąca z rzędu osiąga.

C'est aussi la gare du métro parisien qui a le plus d'interconnexions et qui est aujourd'hui le métro le plus peuplé de France.\"\n\nUne évocation de la Commune, une interprétation de la ligne 13, un propos sur le Grand Paris : l'image du candidat socialiste à la présidentielle est entièrement dessinée. Et c'est tout à son honneur.\n\nFrançois Hollande, en tête dans les sondages dans l'hypothèse d'un second tour PS-UMP, est prêt à \"vaincre\".

Il refuse, en effet, les \"interviews d'état major\" ou les \"terrain live\". Il répondra à toutes les questions des journalistes, mais il veut contrôler ses interventions médiatiques. Il s'agit d'une prise de pouvoir.

"According to the latest data from market researcher GfK, Microsoft’s Xbox 360 is the most popular console in France, ahead of Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Nintendo’s Wii.\n\nDuring the 12 weeks ending on January 5th, Xbox 360 sales were 5.3 percent of the total market, compared to the PS3 at 4.7 percent and Wii at 4.3 percent.\n\n\"The latest 12 weeks have been a good one for Microsoft, with Xbox 360 selling more units than PlayStation 3 and Wii combined,” said Philippe Carle, GfK Entertainment’s managing director for France, Spain and Andorra. “In the same period, Wii and Xbox 360 outperformed PlayStation 3 and Nintendo sold less Wii units.”\n\nThe stats were first revealed by Microsoft in the country, but according to MCV the figures don’t account for digital sales.\n\nBack in December, Sony announced that it had sold more than 70 million PlayStation 3 consoles worldwide.<|endoftext|>The color is well chosen, the fabric is very soft, and the fitting is perfect.

"From: Andrew Bartolozzi\n\nSent: April 7, 2006\n\nTo: rule-comments@sec.gov\n\nSubject: File No. SR-NASDAQ-2006-084 On behalf of MCM Fund Management Inc. (\"MCM\"), I respectfully request that the SEC approve SR-NASDAQ-2006-084, the proposed rules amendments to adopt the Financial Information Exchange (\"FIX\") protocol for NASDAQ transactions. The proposed rules amendments are consistent with a two-year pilot project conducted by the NASDAQ Market Services division. While this pilot project included only fixed-income securities, the FIX protocol is capable of supporting securities in all trading venues. I believe the FIX protocol offers several key advantages, including: (1) Minimizes latency: When market participants use FIX, they trade directly with one another, instead of indirectly through an intermediary. Because all data is exchanged in real-time, latency is minimized, allowing for quicker execution of trades. (2) Reduces network congestion: When market participants use FIX, the network that is used to route data is reduced, thus reducing network congestion. (3) Simplifies data integration: The FIX protocol is a universal data format that is used by all market participants. Thus, the data formats required to be shared by market participants, such as trade, quote, and last sale data, can be standardized, and the data can be formatted and sent in real-time. (4) Increases market transparency: The FIX protocol has a unique field that can contain an attribute for \"transparency\" of the message. This transparency field allows for the inclusion of the identity of the participants involved in the trade, along with other types of non-standard fields that can be specified by the market participant, and thus provide additional transparency to the market. (5) Allows for future expansion: The FIX protocol is not limited to the types of information that can be exchanged between market participants. New types of information can be added to the FIX protocol by each market participant as needed, and as new types of FIX implementations are developed, the ability to implement new types of messages will continue to expand. The FIX protocol will also be required by the SEC's Regulation NMS, as required by the recently passed Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While we strongly support this legislation, we strongly encourage the SEC to mandate FIX by September 1, 2007, as opposed to the September 1, 2009, date specified by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We feel that requiring FIX earlier than required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act would help the market participants, and the NASDAQ market, transition to the FIX protocol more efficiently, and would be beneficial to investors. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter with the staff. Respectfully, Andrew Bartolozzi Managing Director MCM Fund Management, Inc. 31 N.

The panelists identified the need for unions to be proactive in developing a relationship with public officials at all levels of government, and the need for public officials to remain accountable to the electorate, and be proactive in their oversight of public sector bargaining.\n\nJohn Swain, The McGraw Professor of Law and the Chair of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, opened the discussion with a summary of public-sector bargaining.\n\nGovernments have traditionally used collective bargaining to determine the pay, benefits, and working conditions of public employees. The public sector is, however, a much smaller segment of the American workforce, which is becoming increasingly divided. Non-union employees in the private sector, by contrast, are making significant wage gains in the post-recession economy. And this divide, Professor Swain noted, will likely create further tension between the public sector and the private sector.\n\nCollective bargaining agreements between government employers and unions have traditionally served to benefit both parties, but Professor Swain indicated that today, these agreements are instead being utilized by both government employers and unions to determine who will be the dominant actor in public employment. The challenge, he noted, is that the same circumstances are unlikely to exist in both the public and private sectors.\n\nAs part of the public sector, Professor Swain explained, the long-term viability of these collective bargaining agreements is contingent on stable employment, and consequently, maintaining a work force that can afford to pay more in wages. In the private sector, however, government regulations such as minimum wages are not applicable, and there are fewer constraints on whether or not a company can close or move. Consequently, he noted, the private sector tends to have greater flexibility in responding to economic downturns. In other words, he noted, collective bargaining in the public sector is only possible in an environment of stability.\n\nUnions are also facing challenges in recruiting new members, including recruiting members from historically underrepresented groups. Even though people are becoming more aware of the economic gains for unionized workers, he noted, they are still reluctant to join unions.\n\nThese circumstances have lead to the reduction in the size and strength of public sector unions. Unionization rates in the public sector are at a 100-year low.\n\nProfessor Swain closed by noting that public sector unions are facing significant challenges in the near future, particularly in the areas of: (1) political action, (2) collective bargaining, and (3) recruitment. Professor Swain suggested that a significant portion of this challenge will lie in balancing the “power and fairness” within the collective bargaining process.\n\nDan Katcher, Vice President of Policy and General Counsel of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, began his discussion with a brief history of the right to strike in the United States. Strikes are not protected by the First Amendment, but they are still legal under federal labor law.\n\nIn terms of strikes in the public sector, Mr. Katcher explained that, traditionally, the courts have not seen these strikes as a threat to the public’s safety. On the contrary, he noted, the courts have seen them as a vital way for public employees to exercise their rights. However, in the last decade, there has been a trend toward laws that limit the right to strike.\n\nMr. Katcher provided several examples of current court cases involving public sector strikes, including strikes by unions and members of public safety organizations. The Supreme Court, he noted, has generally held that laws limiting the right to strike in the public sector are valid, if the restrictions are for legitimate government purposes, such as protecting public health and safety.\n\nMr. Katcher concluded that, in light of these developments, unions have developed new strategies for organizing in the public sector. These strategies, which include identifying sympathetic public officials and developing stronger relationships with public officials, are essential to the continued success of public sector unions.\n\nRyan Tipps, the Director of the Council of State Governments (CSG) Center for Best Practices and the former Deputy Director of the Office of Personnel Management, concluded the panel discussion by describing how the United States has had a long history of labor unions and collective bargaining in the private sector, while having a much shorter history of labor unions and collective bargaining in the public sector. However, labor unions and collective bargaining have a rich history in the United States. He argued that it is time to embrace this history, and allow unions to contribute to a healthier economy.\n\nThe panel discussion concluded with a question and answer session, during which the panelists discussed strategies for unions to achieve a healthy balance of power and fairness in the collective bargaining process, and strategies for unions to organize in the public sector, particularly with regards to women and minorities.<|endoftext|>Voted as the Best Restaurant in Bath in the Restaurant Association of Great Britain Awards 2010 and Best Italian in the 2008 British Curry Awards, La Favorita will spoil you for choice when"
"This was an article that I originally wrote for The Times of Malta newspaper in September 2009.\n\nAs the refugee and asylum seeker debate in Europe gets more and more heated, it is easy to lose sight of the facts. It is especially easy to lose sight of the reality of the African situation. Many people are aware of how people are fleeing to the shores of Europe from conflict zones in Afghanistan and Iraq. Fewer are aware of the scale of the problem from countries such as Eritrea, or for that matter countries such as Ivory Coast, Kenya, Sudan, Zimbabwe and so on.\n\nThe United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has estimated that there are more than 2 million refugees and asylum seekers who have been unable to find protection from their own government in other parts of Africa. It is a significant number, and one that needs to be more widely known about and understood.\n\nAt the moment, of the 42,000 people who applied for asylum in the EU in the first six months of 2009, less than 1,000 were from African countries. This is less than 3%. The real number of refugees from Africa is likely to be far higher. It is common for refugees to pass through a country such as Libya before reaching the shores of Europe, to make their claims to asylum as European citizens.\n\nThere is a high level of awareness about the refugee situation in the Middle East, but comparatively little awareness about Africa. There is still a common perception that refugees are white, European and middle-class. This is a mistaken perception. The truth is that refugees can be from any walk of life and any country. While it is a hard and dangerous trip to the shores of Europe from war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is not much easier to make that journey from neighbouring countries such as Eritrea.\n\nThe Eritrean government has an abysmal record in protecting the human rights of its own people. According to Amnesty International, the human rights situation is described as being among the worst in the world. Torture and unlawful detention are the norm. This is combined with an almost complete absence of an independent judiciary. The entire state apparatus is controlled by the government.\n\nThe human rights situation in the country is an issue that has been raised by successive European governments, and by the US State Department. Yet while asylum claims from Iraqis and Afghanis have rocketed in the last two years, those from Eritrea have not increased.\n\nThe reason is simply the lack of awareness and the unwillingness of the EU governments to accept Eritrean asylum seekers. This is despite the fact that the country is a leading source of refugees and asylum seekers. The current refugee policy in the EU focuses on countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Eritrea is overlooked, with the implication that the human rights situation is not so bad there. The sad fact is that many of the refugees from Eritrea would qualify for asylum in the EU.\n\nIt is in this context that the EU should review its current policy towards refugees and asylum seekers. At the moment, it focuses on the neighbouring Middle East countries, as it seeks to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving on European shores. This is a necessary policy, but it should not mean that the issue of refugees and asylum seekers from the rest of Africa should be ignored. As the numbers of refugees from other African countries will increase, the policy should be focused on them.\n\nThe EU needs to set up an asylum policy which covers all of Africa, and to ensure that the real needs of refugees are given the necessary protection. It also needs to ensure that the safety of asylum seekers who arrive at the EU’s borders is taken into account. The policy needs to focus on the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. These rights are already guaranteed in the Geneva Conventions.<|endoftext|>Tuesday, February 19, 2017 at 6:00 PM\n\nMatt Damon brings the pages of \"Reinventing Hollywood\" to life. More from this author »\n\nWith HBO's \"Project Greenlight\" now in its 15th season, Matt Damon has become synonymous with the annual contest. And with good reason: Damon is a founding executive producer of the reality series, which allows novice filmmakers to pitch their scripts to a panel of established filmmakers. (Notable winners include \"Bridesmaids\" writer Annie Mumolo and \"Sorry to Bother You\" writer/director Boots Riley.)\n\nNow, the two-time Oscar winner and five-time Golden Globe nominee has teamed with co-writer Ben Affleck to deliver a book that provides an inside look at their experience of discovering and developing original material.\n\n\"Reinventing Hollywood: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit Is Transforming the Entertainment Industry\" (Hachette Books, $26.00) will be released in April. As indicated by its title, the book will outline how the concept of auteur filmmaking has been challenged by the rise of the millennial, who wants to have a say in the making of the film.\n\n\"When I think of a 'Citizen Kane' or a 'Godfather,' it's the vision of a single person and not a committee,\" Affleck told Variety. \"I don't think we're in the era of the auteur. I think we're in the era of a lot of people trying to express themselves and be seen.\"\n\nAlso on Affleck and Damon's agenda: the \"Ocean's\" franchise. In November, they appeared at CinemaCon with director Gary Ross to unveil the first footage from the upcoming \"Ocean's 8,\" which will star Sandra Bullock as Danny Ocean's sister and a crew of Hollywood's most talented women.\n\n\"It's a movie about a heist,\" said Ross, who also directed the first two \"Seabiscuit\" movies and \"Pleasantville.\" \"You're going to get to know the crew.\"\n\n\"Ocean's 8\" is scheduled for release on June 8, 2018.\n\n© 2018 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC<|endoftext|>An ethics complaint filed against New York state Sen. Michael Venditto alleges that he used state resources and state time to help his father, Oyster Bay Town Supervisor John Venditto, when he was running for mayor of Oyster Bay.\n\nThe ethics complaint filed by Sean Griffith, a former Republican candidate for town council, says that Michael Venditto would not have won election to his current state Senate seat without the help of his father and that in the time since Michael Venditto was elected, his father has turned to the state senator to help him with Oyster Bay's finances.\n\n\"When Venditto was running for state senate, he told voters he would serve his constituents,\" Griffith said. \"It's apparent that's not the case. He's being a yes man for his father and is using his father's position to get his way.\"\n\nIn the complaint, Griffith said that Michael Venditto had staff members in his Senate office work on his father's campaign for mayor.\n\n\"When John Venditto lost the election, he took Michael Venditto into the town of Oyster Bay and Michael Venditto's employees into the town of Oyster Bay,\" he said. \"There are nine people who work for the town who worked on Michael Venditto's senate campaign.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint, the town has since paid Michael Venditto's campaign bills and reimbursed his campaign expenses.\n\nThe allegations included in the complaint were denied by Venditto.\n\n\"I'm not taking anything away from my father. I've got a great relationship with my father,\" he said. \"We haven't done anything wrong, nor have we done anything illegal. Everything was above board and all within the law.\"\n\nVenditto said he has done nothing illegal and has not broken any laws.\n\n\"The idea that I would use taxpayer dollars to fund my father's campaign is ludicrous,\" he said. \"I know what the rules are and I know that we haven't done anything wrong.\"\n\nVenditto said he's never talked to his father about taking his employees in the town to the state Senate.\n\n\"We didn't have a conversation where he asked me to hire his people,\" Venditto said. \"My dad didn't tell me that he wanted my people in the town of Oyster Bay.\"\n\nThe complaint includes an email exchange between Michael Venditto and Brian Scully, a member of the state senate's policy staff. The emails in the complaint include conversations between the two about Venditto's father's finances and how Michael Venditto was having issues with state budgeting for his office.\n\nIn one email, Michael Venditto said he was going to use a special assistant to the state Senate to help his father.\n\n\"I can put him to work on constituent casework, but the same person can help my father with his stuff,\" he wrote.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Venditto was trying to use state employees to help his father's mayoral campaign.\n\n\"My father had no idea that I was going to do that,\" Venditto said. \"I did it because I was getting so much pressure from my constituents who wanted to be helped with housing and crime.\"\n\nThe ethics complaint was filed with the Joint Commission on Public Ethics on May 31. It is awaiting a response from JCOPE.\n\nThe Joint Commission on Public Ethics is an independent state ethics and lobbying agency that was established in 2011 and given oversight of public corruption, bribery, campaign finance and ethics laws.\n\nNassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice, who is also running for state attorney general, said Venditto's alleged conduct raises questions about whether he is following the state's code of ethics.\n\n\"There are a number of issues that raise concerns and if they were to be pursued would certainly call into question whether Senator Venditto is following the state code of ethics,\" Rice said.\n"
"Liner Notes\n\nSandra:\n\nWhile I was performing at the coffeehouse one night, several women came up to me and said they had a new organization and asked me to get involved. They were the Mother's to the Rescue. They wanted to speak out against the abuse of their children, a topic that is always close to my heart. I met a member of the group and began meeting with her to get information on the organization. She told me that their group was designed to help mothers who were afraid to speak out against the abuse of their children for fear of reprisal. They were concerned that if mothers got involved in speaking out against their spouses, they would lose their children, and the mothers were afraid of being separated from their children. After months of meetings with the group, I decided to join the organization.\n\nIt was the Mother's to the Rescue that asked me to do this recording, so that their voices could be heard. It was the Mother's to the Rescue that allowed me to visit them and to use their stories to speak out against abuse. I've had many talks with mothers who have been raped and abused and who don't know what to do or who to turn to. It's very difficult to have to go through this kind of a tragedy alone. It's even more difficult to have to stay silent about it. I can understand why the mother's want to keep it a secret. I wouldn't want to let anyone know, either. And I would be frightened to death of the results.\n\nI can remember the first time I felt that I wasn't being taken care of. I remember the first time I didn't feel good enough or that I wasn't enough for my parents. When you grow up without feeling like you're good enough, you don't have a self-esteem. That's why I'm so concerned about the children in this world. We are giving children and parents who are already in bad situations, so many things that are toxic. For example, we are putting children on Ritalin when they're not sick. In other words, we're drugging them. We are putting them on this drug because their mothers have been abused and they are angry and we think the child has a bad attitude. We put him on Ritalin so he'll shut up. And the mother thinks it's good because the child is quiet. But we're not giving the mother or the child any love.\n\nMy first experience with drugs was when I was 15 years old. I was drinking too much, and I was also abusing the pills I was taking for my back. When I turned 16, I started using heroin. This was about the time that I met my husband, and he was already abusing heroin. I thought heroin would help me escape from reality, but it didn't. It just made me very ill and it made my relationship with my husband very difficult.\n\nI went to a methadone clinic because I had a lot of blood in my urine and I knew I had a bad infection. I went to the clinic because it was the only way I could get my hands on the pills I needed. I went to the clinic, and I did it to help myself. The clinic was the most humiliating thing I had ever done in my life. I had to be weighed and they put the scale on a little table that was at the bottom of the bed. They handed me a little yellow urine cup and put it on the same little table. And the nurses took my blood pressure. Then they weighed me and told me how much I weighed. And then they had me piss in the cup, and they put my piss on a little counter, and they put it on the same little table. When I went to pick up my pills, they weighed me and they took my blood pressure again. I was very upset by the whole thing, and I said to the nurse, \"Look, I just did this to get pills. I know I need them, and I don't need you telling me I need them.\" I never went back to the clinic. I did all of that for me, but I couldn't do that to my child. I couldn't let him know that I had such low self-esteem that I felt that I was nothing. I couldn't tell my child that, because it wouldn't be fair. And I wouldn't be able to show him the love I felt I didn't have.\n\nThis organization - the Mother's to the Rescue - it's for the mother's who don't want to speak out against their husbands for fear of losing their children. I would like to see women reach out to these mothers who don't have a self-esteem and don't have a voice. I would like to see women offer these mothers a place to go for help. I would like to see them reach out and give these women the love they need and the love they want to give their children, and I would like to see them give their children the love they need and the love they want to give their children.\n\nI know I'm not a doctor, but I would like to see women stop giving their children so many drugs. There's so much poisoning our children today. Our children need our love, and they need to know that they're good enough. It's the love that's lacking. It's not going to be the mother's who are beaten by their husbands who are going to reach out to the battered woman and say, \"It's okay. It's okay. Come over to my house and we'll get your child, and we'll love you and your child. We'll give you the love you need and the love you want.\" And it's not going to be the battered woman who is being beaten by her husband who is going to reach out and say, \"It's okay. You're a good mother. Come over to my house, and we'll get your child, and we'll give him the love he needs and the love he wants.\" No. It's not going to be those women who are being beaten and raped that are going to reach out to the battered mother and say, \"It's okay. We're here for you.\" No, it's not. It's going to be the woman who doesn't have a self-esteem and who feels like she's not good enough, that's who's going to reach out and give love to a battered mother and a battered child. And when women have a strong sense of self-esteem and know that they are good enough, they will reach out and give love to those women who need their love and those children who need their love.\n\nAnd maybe if the mother doesn't speak out against her husband, she'll still have a relationship with her child. She may have to sacrifice some of her dreams, but it's worth it. She'll have to sacrifice her self-esteem to save her child. The child's the most important thing. And if that means a mother has to give up her self-esteem, I think it's worth it. You have to love your child. You have to save your child. You have to do whatever it takes to save your child.\n\n(Words of Wisdom by Joan Didion)<|endoftext|>﻿\n\nEating right is a large part of the process of weight loss. The more informed you are about what you're eating, the better. You can avoid many potential problems with the right information. Check out these simple, yet helpful tips, for better eating habits.\n\n\n\nThis tip is not about losing weight. It is however, a helpful way to stop your cravings for certain foods. Keeping a food journal is a great way to track your intake of food. Knowing what you have eaten and how much can help you see the real truth about your eating habits. When you are aware of your eating habits, you are better equipped to make healthy choices.\n\n\n\nEat dinner with your family. It is difficult to make the right decisions about food when you eat alone. By eating with your family, you will be more inclined to eat a meal that the entire family can enjoy. A meal that is not only healthy for you, but your family members as well.\n\n\n\nA good way to lose weight is to cut out all sodas. Sodas are terrible for you and they can easily get you hooked. Try drinking water or flavored seltzer water instead. These beverages are better for you and can help you cut calories out of your diet.\n\n\n\nA good way to lose weight is to try eating an apple every time you're hungry. This is a great idea because apples are very filling and will not leave you with cravings for junk food. In addition to that, apples are a very healthy snack.\n\n\n\nOne easy way to reduce your caloric intake while dining out is to ask for salad dressing and sauce on the side. You can then control how much you use, and this technique will save you many calories. It is also a good idea to use oil and vinegar instead of creamy salad dressing.\n\n\n\nPay attention to your drinks. Those who are trying to lose weight should pay special attention to the beverages they consume. Although it is not necessary to avoid drinking beverages altogether, you should take a closer look at the ones you consume most often. Many beverages such as sodas and sweet tea are loaded with calories, and can lead to weight gain. Instead, you should drink water, juice, or diet soda.\n\n\n\nDon't use food as a way to deal with emotions or stress. Many people turn to food for comfort when they are depressed or anxious. The problem is, that food itself has little or no ability to solve any of the underlying issues. Food should be a source of nourishment, not a source of anxiety. By eliminating comfort foods, you will reduce your overall caloric intake.\n\n\n\nWhen you are dieting, make sure to stop eating at least two hours before bed"

NEW JERSEY, (1987) No. 86-1254 Argued: October 13, 1987 Decided: December 8, 1987\n\nIn 1976, New Jersey enacted the State Street Bank and Trust Company Holding Company Act, which provides for the dissolution of any out-of-state bank holding company with a controlling interest in a New Jersey state-chartered bank, unless the holding company adopts a plan of divestiture that the New Jersey Banking Department finds will \"preserve and protect\" the assets and liabilities of the bank. Although the Holding Company Act specifies that it applies only to banks \"whose principal place of business is in this State,\" the Department applied it to a New York bank holding company with controlling interests in two New Jersey state-chartered banks, one of which has its principal place of business in New Jersey and the other of which is located in Pennsylvania. The bank holding company brought this action in Federal District Court, which upheld the application of the statute, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n\nHeld:\n\n1. A bank holding company's activity in other states, without more, cannot suffice to render it subject to the requirements of the New Jersey Holding Company Act. To require otherwise would not serve the purposes of that Act. Pp. 76-80.\n\n(a) The Act is designed to protect the interests of the public and the integrity of the financial system. These interests do not automatically attach to an out-of-state bank holding company that controls a state-chartered bank with its principal place of business in New Jersey, but rather attach only to the holding company if it, in turn, exercises control over the bank. When a New Jersey statute attaches such interests to an out-of-state entity, it acts on the out-of-state entity and may require the out-of-state entity to comply with its dictates. When, by contrast, an out-of-state entity is subjected to a statute that seeks to attach such interests to it without making any showing of its control over an entity subject to the statute, that entity is not being regulated by the statute, but is instead being punished for an injury inflicted on the public by its exercise of its constitutional right to engage in interstate commerce. Thus, the key inquiry in determining whether a statute's application to an out-of-state entity constitutes regulation or punishment is the connection between the activity of the out-of-state entity and the State. Pp. 76-78.\n\n(b) Because the New Jersey Holding Company Act requires that the bank subject to divestiture have its principal place of business in New Jersey, it seeks to regulate out-of-state bank holding companies that control state-chartered banks with their principal place of business in New Jersey. By requiring these holding companies to divest themselves of their control over such banks, the Act \"regulates\" the banks themselves and those who control them. Thus, in determining whether the application of the Act to the out-of-state bank holding company at issue here \"regulates\" that company or, instead, punishes it, the crucial question is whether, under the Act, the New Jersey Banking Department can require the out-of-state bank holding company to divest itself of its control over a bank with its principal place of business in New Jersey unless that holding company first submits to the Department's regulatory review and the Department approves the divestiture plan. The Act, however, does not provide for any such review, but instead applies only if the New Jersey Banking Department finds that the out-of-state holding company's divestiture plan will \"preserve and protect\" the assets and liabilities of the affected bank. The Department has given no indication that it would or could examine the effect of the divestiture plan on the affected bank's assets and liabilities, or otherwise engage in regulatory review. And, to the extent that the New Jersey Holding Company Act directs divestiture of control over a bank in order to protect the assets and liabilities of that bank, it is punishing the out-of-state holding company, not regulating it. Because the Act applies to the bank holding company by virtue of its ownership of the bank, and not by virtue of the company's control over that bank, it regulates the bank and not the holding company. Pp. 78-80.\n\n2. The application of the New Jersey Holding Company Act to a bank holding company that owns a bank with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania does not violate the Commerce Clause. Although that Act applies only to banks with their principal place of business in New Jersey, it affects the bank holding company by virtue of its ownership of a bank with its principal place of business in New Jersey. Thus, the Act regulates the bank holding company and the bank, but it does not treat the bank as part of New Jersey, for the Act does not require the bank holding company to locate in New Jersey or to conduct its banking activities there. The New Jersey Holding Company Act, therefore, is a legitimate exercise of the State's power to protect its own residents. Pp. 80-81.\n\n710 F.2d 1108, reversed.\n\nBURGER, C.

Brown argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Charles J. O'Connor, Jr. *\n\n[ Footnote * ] Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the American Bankers Association by Joseph A. Trillo, Edward R. Becker, and Donald L. Buckley; for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by Samuel R. Robson and John G. Kester; and for the National Bank of Commerce by Richard M. Schwartz, William F. Hechinger, and George F. Moore.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nNew Jersey has enacted a statute that purports to regulate the manner in which a bank holding company that controls a state-chartered bank with its principal place of business in New Jersey, may divest itself of that control. The question presented is whether such a statute is constitutional in its application to a bank holding company that controls a bank with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania.\n\nI\n\nThe New Jersey State Street Bank and Trust Company Holding Company Act of 1976 (Act) [477 U.S. 79, 81] established a regulatory scheme designed to protect the public from the consequences of bank holding companies' control of New Jersey banks. N. J. Stat. Ann. 54:3-12.1 to 54:3-12.6 (West Supp. 1987). Section 54:3-12.3 provides that\n\n\"[a]ny holding company which is a subsidiary of an out-of-state bank holding company, or a holding company which is a subsidiary of an out-of-state bank holding company and which directly or indirectly controls any bank located in this State, shall submit to the Banking Department, and the department shall approve, a divestiture plan for the preservation and protection of the assets and liabilities of any bank or banks in this State in which such holding company has a controlling interest, and shall divest itself of such interest within a period of three years after the date such divestiture plan is approved.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nIn December 1978, New Jersey's Banking Department promulgated regulations that incorporated by reference the statutory definition of \"out-of-state holding company,\" which included \"a corporation organized under the laws of any other state of the United States which controls a bank or banks located in New Jersey or which is a subsidiary of an out-of-state bank holding company which controls a bank or banks located in New Jersey.\" N. J. Admin. Code, Dept. of Banking, Div. of Banking and Insurance, Reg. No. 119.14, 4.1. Thus, the statutory provision defining the term \"out-of-state holding company\" was made part of the New Jersey regulatory scheme.\n\nIn 1981, the Banking Department ordered the State Street Bank and Trust Company, which is headquartered in New York, to divest itself of its controlling interests in two New Jersey banks: the State Street Bank and Trust Company of New Jersey, N. A. (State Street Bank), which has its principal place of business in New Jersey; and the State Street Bank and Trust Company of New York, N. A"

Together, the two set out to track down the men responsible for their respective loved ones’ deaths.\n\nI know it sounds like Taken 3 is just Taken with an extra number tacked on the end, but the first trailer for the film does a solid job of setting up this particular story. The biggest takeaway is that Taken 3 is actually the third movie of a series that was clearly meant to be a one-off. If you’re going to take a character, kill his wife, and make him a vengeance-fueled killing machine, at least give him a different set of friends to rely on. It just doesn’t make sense to rely on an old CIA operative in the third installment.\n\nI’m curious to see how this plays out. The marketing campaign is really on-point here, as it’s certainly paying homage to Taken while playing into its strengths as a big budget action movie. What I’m wondering is whether or not Taken 3 will feature the same chemistry between Neeson and his daughter that we saw in the first two films. Or whether the chemistry of the new buddy cop story will be what pushes this film over the top.\n\nEither way, I think Taken 3 is going to be fun. Here’s the official synopsis:\n\nAnchored by Neeson’s undeniable screen presence, Taken 3 continues the ex-CIA operative’s adrenaline-fueled pursuit to save his daughter from the clutches of a murderously determined abductor.\n\nAs for Neeson, he’s been quite busy in 2014. He’s appeared in three different films this year alone: Non-Stop, A Walk Among the Tombstones, and now Taken 3.\n\nTaken 3 opens in theaters on March 5, 2015.<|endoftext|>Armao's® Signature Cut\n\nOur exquisite New York strip steaks are aged for 2-3 weeks in an atmosphere that is customized to create a juicy, tender steak.\n\nWhen this item is added to your cart, it means your order has been partially accepted.

I’m just ironing the face of my shirt, so I don’t need much. I don’t think it’s any worse than any other iron I’ve used, but I’m not one to notice much difference. The only thing that bothered me was that I had to fill it up with water, and I had to actually fill it almost the entire way.

"The question of what causes psychopathy and other antisocial personality disorders (ASPD) is a matter of continued interest. ASPD may arise from many of the same factors that cause schizophrenia. However, unlike schizophrenia, ASPD is not a syndrome with a clear biological etiology. Rather, it is a syndrome that represents a mix of diverse etiologies. In addition, the genetic influence on ASPD is modest. Despite its heterogeneous etiologies and genetic risks, ASPD does have a clear neuropathology. Studies have shown that individuals with ASPD have abnormalities in brain regions that control emotion and impulsivity, such as the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex. These two brain regions appear to have developed abnormally in individuals with ASPD, resulting in the pathology of the disorder.\n\nPsychopathology\n\nPsychopathology refers to any of the various psychological or behavioral disorders that affect a person's cognition, emotions, or behavior. The DSM-IV describes several types of personality disorders that, according to this taxonomy, are based on the person's affect, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control. Psychopathology includes, but is not limited to, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders, and thought disorders.\n\nClinical psychology refers to the study of psychopathology, personality, and social and abnormal psychology. Clinical psychologists evaluate, diagnose, and treat psychological problems. Clinical psychologists work with patients with a wide range of psychopathology, such as:\n\nEtiology\n\nAccording to research from psychologists at Washington University in St. Louis, children as young as age 2 who display symptoms of aggression, such as throwing temper tantrums or hitting others, are at increased risk of developing antisocial behavior and even psychopathology. In addition, the study found that children who display antisocial behavior at age 8 are also more likely to develop a substance abuse problem.\n\nA study of adult male prisoners by Harvard University researchers found that psychopathy is not an unusual or rare condition, but rather is very common, occurring in perhaps 15 percent of the population. One psychopathic characteristic, in particular, was found to be related to psychopathic behavior: impulsivity. When researchers investigated the neuroanatomical regions and specific brain structures related to the psychopathic characteristic of impulsivity, they discovered that the structures that were the most linked to this characteristic are the ones that have also been implicated in cocaine addiction. The researchers suggested that these findings might provide clues about the nature of impulsivity and the nature of psychopathy, in general.\n\nThe cause of antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy is largely unknown, but research indicates that it is caused by a complex interaction of factors. Environmental factors appear to play a role in the development of ASPD, but no specific psychosocial or environmental risk factors have been identified. Environmental influences may include certain parenting practices, abuse, and neglect, but these influences have not been confirmed.\n\nAn association between ASPD and low levels of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) has been reported. Researchers believe that low levels of MAO-A, which is an enzyme that helps to regulate the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, may cause high levels of neurotransmitters. High levels of neurotransmitters have been implicated in certain forms of impulsive behavior.\n\nA study by Cambridge University researchers reported that certain genes are linked to antisocial behavior. The researchers studied over 1,000 males in New Zealand who were adopted as infants and found that they were five times more likely to display antisocial behavior than were the other males in the study. The researchers also found that antisocial behavior was linked to specific versions of the MAOA and the serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR genes.\n\nGenetic factors may also be implicated in ASPD. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health reported that children who are genetically related to an individual with ASPD are at a higher risk of also developing the disorder. In this study, children with an affected sibling or parent were six times more likely to display antisocial behavior than were children with no affected family members.\n\nAdditionally, a family history of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder, may increase the risk of ASPD.\n\nStudies have also suggested that ASPD is more prevalent in males than in females. However, not all studies have confirmed this gender difference.\n\nASPD is associated with abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the anterior cingulate cortex. These regions appear to be structurally and functionally abnormal in individuals with ASPD, particularly in individuals with psychopathy. Studies have also suggested that the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex play a role in regulating the brain regions that are linked to emotional and behavioral control.\n\nAnxiety disorders also seem to be highly comorbid with ASPD. People with ASPD are at increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder, and vice versa. Research has suggested that this comorbidity may be related to impulsivity. Studies have shown that people with ASPD are more impulsive than are people without ASPD. These studies suggest that the more impulsive a person is, the more likely he or she is to display the symptoms of an anxiety disorder.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nASPD is a relatively common disorder, affecting an estimated 1.6 percent of men and 0.8 percent of women in the United States. It is more common in males than in females. ASPD is typically diagnosed during adulthood, and most individuals with ASPD develop the disorder by age 18. However, the disorder can develop at any age, even in childhood.\n\nASPD may be diagnosed more frequently in certain countries, such as the United States, and less frequently in other countries. For example, researchers have reported that the prevalence of ASPD is significantly higher in the United States than in the United Kingdom.\n\nHistory\n\nThe term antisocial personality disorder was coined in 1908 by the American psychiatrist George E. Partridge. Partridge described antisocial personality disorder as a \"predisposition to evil.\" He believed that antisocial personality disorder was a disorder of heredity and was therefore considered to be incurable.\n\nIn 1941, American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley provided the first full clinical description of antisocial personality disorder in his book The Mask of Sanity. Cleckley described ASPD as \"the behavior disorder of adult life\" that was characterized by \"greed for the esteem of others and the envy and resentment of those thought to possess more.\" Cleckley viewed ASPD as a disorder of personality and believed that it was incurable.\n\nTreatments\n\nThe treatments available for ASPD are different from those used for anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. This is due to the different pathologies of ASPD and these other disorders.\n\nBecause the cause of ASPD is not well understood, researchers have not developed treatments specifically targeted at the pathology of the disorder. However, various forms of psychotherapy have been found to be effective in treating ASPD. These psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy, focus on addressing the core symptoms of ASPD.\n\nIn addition, certain types of medication, such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications, may be effective in treating the symptoms of ASPD.\n\nQuestions for Further Thought\n\nSome researchers have suggested that ASPD should be treated as a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as ADHD, rather than as a personality disorder. What is your opinion about this idea? Do you believe that ASPD is a disorder of the brain and, therefore, should be considered a neurodevelopmental disorder?\n\nReferences:\n\nAlbuquerque, E.

"Congressional Record Statement of Rep. Frank Pallone\n\nDelivered in the House of Representatives, July 30, 1998\n\nIt is an honor to speak today about H.R. 3700, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1998, introduced by my colleague from New Jersey, Representative Rob Andrews.\n\nThis legislation will help us address the significant problems that exist in our drinking water.\n\nFor example, as many of my colleagues know, chlorinated water can give off the toxic gas chlorine. Although the Federal Government has known about the dangers of chlorine gas since 1921, we do not know how many water systems in this country are vulnerable to the effects of chlorine gas because we do not know the proper standards that must be in place to protect people from chlorine gas.\n\nAnother problem that exists with our drinking water is that many of the chemicals that are currently used in water treatment facilities are extremely dangerous. For example, asbestos, a known carcinogen, is one of the chemicals currently used.\n\nLast year I introduced legislation in an effort to address the problems that exist in our drinking water. My legislation was designed to help ensure that the American people would not be exposed to toxic contaminants in their drinking water. This legislation passed the House of Representatives in the last Congress by a vote of 406 to 17. It had support from a wide range of organizations, including the National Association of Local Boards of Health, the American Public Health Association, and the American Medical Association.\n\nUnfortunately, we are still not able to achieve the reforms in drinking water policy that we so desperately need.\n\nAlthough my legislation was bipartisan, the Republican leadership in the Senate never brought the bill to the floor for a vote.\n\nH.R. 3700, introduced by Representative Andrews, does not address the same problems that my legislation did. I will work with the bill's sponsors to address my concerns regarding this legislation as it goes through the legislative process.\n\nThis bill provides assistance to States to pay for water systems that fail to meet health standards.\n\nThis bill also provides money to update the Safe Drinking Water Act to account for the problems associated with contaminants, such as asbestos, that are being used in water treatment facilities.\n\nAdditionally, this legislation is designed to provide funds to States to remove underground storage tanks that contain fuel. These tanks are known to contaminate groundwater.\n\nI have worked with the Administration and have offered them some suggestions regarding the bill. I will be working with my colleagues to address my concerns regarding the bill.\n\nI will be working to add additional funding for assistance to those States that are in the process of implementing new water treatment facilities. I believe that the more funding we can provide, the better the chances that we will be able to assure the safety of our drinking water.\n\nSource: http://pallone.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=116382<|endoftext|>Conclusions: The introduction of a low FODMAP diet seems to be a useful approach for managing IBS symptoms in a high proportion of IBS patients. However, certain food groups are not targeted and most of the low FODMAP diet is not suitable for long-term application, especially for food products not readily available on the market. It is therefore essential that further research is conducted to develop low FODMAP food products that are commercially available.\n\nResults: Overall, 50% of IBS patients experienced a 50% reduction in symptom severity. In total, 48% of patients benefited from a low FODMAP diet and of these, 64% reported continued relief of symptoms after the end of the trial. Patients reported difficulty in adhering to the diet as they could not always find food products that were low in FODMAPs.\n\nMethods: A prospective study was conducted over 12 weeks in a university-affiliated gastroenterology outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. The participants were evaluated using the ROME III criteria to confirm the diagnosis of IBS and underwent a 2-week run-in phase to exclude potential confounding factors. IBS patients were randomly assigned to a low FODMAP diet group (n = 51) or control group (n = 51). The patients in the low FODMAP diet group received instruction and provided with a low FODMAP diet plan. Symptoms were monitored using a symptom score diary and monitored by a clinical team that was not aware of the allocation group.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to determine the effect of a low FODMAP diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS and to evaluate its potential in reducing the impact of the symptoms on daily life.\n\nBackground: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder, with symptoms including abdominal pain and bloating. A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) diet is an emerging therapeutic strategy for IBS.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder, with symptoms including abdominal pain and bloating. The exact etiology of IBS remains unknown. Multiple putative risk factors have been proposed, including intestinal infection, psychological stress, diet, and altered gut microbiota. Diet may play an important role in the development of IBS. A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) diet has been found to reduce symptoms of bloating and abdominal pain in patients with IBS.\n\nFODMAPs is a collective term for a number of short-chain carbohydrates, oligosaccharides, monosaccharides, and sugar alcohols that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine, thus increasing the osmotic load of the small bowel (1). FODMAPs include fructose, lactose, fructans, galacto-oligosaccharides, and polyols (1). A diet low in FODMAPs was initially proposed as a therapeutic option for patients with IBS. There is growing evidence for the benefit of a low FODMAP diet in improving gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. The high osmotic load of FODMAPs appears to cause distension of the bowel, especially in the small bowel (2). A recent randomized control trial by Macia et al. showed a reduced number of flatulence and loose stools when a low FODMAP diet was compared with a low fiber diet in patients with IBS (3). However, the low FODMAP diet is not suitable for long-term application due to its restrictive nature and potential inability to address the complex etiology of IBS.\n\nFructose is an FODMAP sugar, but its role in IBS remains controversial. Fructose ingestion has been shown to cause gastrointestinal symptoms (4). A previous study showed that an increased fructose intake was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing IBS (5). In contrast, there is also emerging evidence that fructose may have a beneficial role in treating IBS symptoms. In a study by Baer et al. comparing a low FODMAP diet with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs), but high in fructose, similar reductions in symptom severity were observed (6). This suggests that both high-fructose and low-fructose diets may reduce symptoms in IBS patients. However, the long-term effects of fructose and other FODMAPs on the gut microbiome are unknown.\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the effect of a low FODMAP diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS and to evaluate its potential in reducing the impact of the symptoms on daily life. We hypothesize that the low FODMAP diet will lead to improved gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in patients with IBS.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis study was a prospective, randomized, parallel design conducted in the Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, from January 2015 to January 2016. This study received ethics approval from the University of Hong Kong (no. 2014.1005) and all patients signed an informed consent form before their participation in the study.\n\nStudy Participants\n\nThe study protocol was published in a previous randomized controlled trial (3). In brief, patients with a diagnosis of IBS by the Rome III criteria were recruited in this study. The Rome III criteria are a commonly used set of diagnostic criteria for IBS. The criteria include abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month over the past 3 months with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, and onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.\n\nPatients with a gastrointestinal, a metabolic, a hepatic, an endocrine, a respiratory, or a psychiatric disease were excluded from the study. Patients were excluded if they were being treated with antibiotics or laxatives, or if they had been following a low FODMAP diet prior to study entry.\n\nAssessment and Intervention\n\nBaseline demographic and clinical data were collected for each participant. A run-in phase was introduced for the participants to exclude confounding factors. The run-in phase was a 2-week diet without a low FODMAP diet plan. During the run-in phase, the participants were allowed to follow any diet that they deemed suitable for their condition. At the end of the run-in phase, the participants were then assigned to either a low FODMAP diet group or a control group. Participants in the low FODMAP diet group received a low FODMAP diet plan, while those in the control group did not receive any dietary advice.\n\nThe low FODMAP diet plan was provided to all participants. The dietary plan advised the participants to avoid high FOD"
"Story by Mariella Trandafir\n\nLast month, a reporter for a BGN News outlet found himself standing outside the Bulgarian State Rowing Center, as its coach, German national Henrik Hargin, was telling reporters from the Bulgarian National TV Channel what happened inside the indoor rowing training pool a day before. He and his athletes were attacked by two unknown men.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe attacker allegedly “splashed” the coach, while the other hit his hand with a dumbbell. Hargin was sent to the hospital with multiple broken bones.\n\nThe event has become the biggest news in Bulgarian rowing, not to mention other fields of Bulgarian sport. Bulgarian police arrested the two individuals.\n\nThese two attackers are part of an organized crime gang. “A gang of criminals specializing in assault, robberies, drug trafficking and extortion. It was established after a football match last year,” said the head of the National Police Department’s Chief Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime, Ivan Geshev.\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\nThis is not the first time Hargin is the target of an assault. He was attacked two years ago by a group of five people. The coach said the second attack was ordered by a person he allegedly owes a sum of 2,000 levs.\n\nThe story was “invisible” to the police for more than a year. Hargin took the decision to go public and declare publicly that he knew who was behind the attack.\n\nSoon after the Bulgarian National TV aired the story, a man with a high-ranked position in the police said Hargin and his trainer were attacked by two people, but they were hired by two other people, who have nothing to do with organized crime.\n\nThis scenario was later declared fake by Bulgarian National Police Chief Commissioner Sotir Tsatsarov.\n\nIt was clear that the story with the first version was planted to avoid a serious problem, but the problem is the persons behind it.\n\nA politician, two policemen and a boxer\n\nHargin said the names of the persons behind the attack – three people – are well known to the authorities.\n\nOne of them is Svilen Neykov, the former head of the interior minister’s bodyguards and advisor of a major political figure in Bulgaria.\n\nHe was charged with the illegal possession of weapons in 2011. He was also charged with drug trafficking, with several related offenses.\n\nAnother person behind the attack is one of the owners of a luxury spa in Sofia. His company runs a branch in Greece.\n\nThe third person is Svilen Karov, former Bulgarian Amateur Boxing Federation’s head and former owner of a chain of fitness clubs in the country.\n\nNeykov, Hargin and Karov are well known to each other, since Neykov was the bodyguard of former Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov (1997 – 2001) and Karov was a member of the pro-government party GERB (Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria).\n\nA manager and a contract killer\n\nFor more than a year, Neykov and Karov have been in business relations with a manager from the world of sports, who also holds a senior position in the Interior Ministry.\n\nThis manager is known as the personal adviser of a former high-ranked police officer. The adviser is also a former president of the National Council for Combating the Corruption and Bribes.\n\nThis manager allegedly hired a contract killer for the first attack on Hargin.\n\nAfter this attempt failed, he allegedly ordered the two recent attacks. He would not only get rid of Hargin, but would also take the head coach position.\n\nMeanwhile, Neykov has close relations with this manager, with whom he has business interests.\n\nAfter the attack, the two “protectors” of Neykov were apprehended. The investigators took them to Hargin to show the assailants in court.\n\nWhen they left the rowing center, they started to ask who Hargin was and how he was injured. The rowing coach replied: “You don’t know me? You are the guys who attacked me.”\n\nAnd he confirmed their identities in front of a dozen reporters.\n\nThe plan failed\n\nAfter the attack on Hargin and his rowing team, the political figure behind Neykov (his manager) called the head of the Bulgarian National Police Department, Tsatsarov.\n\nTsatsarov also asked who was behind the attack. “Two thugs,” the political figure answered.\n\nBut this did not happen.\n\nSoon after the incident, the National Police Chief said the people behind the attack would be “severely punished.”\n\nSo far, only the two assailants have been arrested. And that was because Neykov and Karov were there when the attack happened.\n\nIf they were in the same car, when the attackers drove off in the car, Neykov and Karov would also be under arrest.\n\nPaid with bags of heroin\n\nIf the attempt to get rid of Hargin in the first attack did not work, it would be more difficult in the future, as he would be more careful.\n\nSo, Neykov needed more money to “hurt” Hargin.\n\nThere is another “party” involved in the scheme – the manager, who has close ties to Neykov. He is an alleged heroin dealer.\n\nThe manager apparently paid Neykov, who paid the two men to get rid of Hargin.\n\nHe told them to wait for Hargin and to show him their genitals when he comes out. Hargin was sprayed with a very strong product, then attacked with the dumbbell.\n\nThe assailants were paid with bags of heroin.\n\nHowever, the men involved in the attack did not know the person who hired them.\n\nThey were told it was a man from Sofia, who wanted to “get rid” of Hargin. He would pay them 1,000 euros each.\n\nThe story has shocked the rowing world.\n\nIt is obvious that whoever the person behind the attack on Hargin is, he is also behind the attacks on two other Bulgarian athletes: skier Todor Yanchev and soccer player Stiliyan Petrov.\n\nYanchev was attacked by two men in Velingrad in April. Petrov was beaten by two people outside his hotel in Sofia, two weeks after Yanchev was attacked.\n\nIn both cases, the attackers were paid with bags of heroin.\n\nThe only difference is that in the case of Yanchev, the attackers were Macedonians, who have “ties” with Bulgarian law enforcement, while the two men who attacked Petrov are not known to the police.\n\nThe protector of Neykov\n\nThere is a politician behind Neykov, but the public is still unaware of his name.\n\nHe has served as the head of an important body in Bulgaria’s government and is currently part of the European Parliament.\n\nThis politician has been connected to one of the biggest drug dealers in the country. The authorities know about his connection to the world of drug trafficking.\n\nAt the same time, he is said to have close connections with a major criminal group in Bulgaria. He is also the “protector” of Neykov.\n\nThe authorities would be unable to charge Neykov, who was charged with drug trafficking and several related offenses, if the politician did not protect him.\n\nWhat do these events mean?\n\nThe problem with sports corruption is no longer a matter of “media speculation.”\n\nA few months ago, a major scandal shook the Bulgarian basketball. The whole country was shocked to learn that a well-known figure in Bulgaria’s sports, who was also the owner of the Bulgarian Basketball Federation’s executive body, was under investigation for an alleged match-fixing scheme.\n\nIt seems like the problem is very serious. We should be concerned that a gangster has “a free hand” in the sports world.\n\nWe should be worried that someone can get rid of a coach with “a few dozen kicks” and “a few dozen pounds of heroin.”\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe public would probably be interested in knowing why the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Boyko Borisov, did not comment on this event.\n\nIf he does not react, people would be asking why he does not react. And if he reacts, he would most probably declare he knew nothing about this story.\n\nWhat is sure is that there are many questions that need answers, and the only one who can provide them is the Bulgarian Prime Minister.\n\nRead the original article in Bulgarian in Novinite.com<|endoftext|>This addon is no longer being supported, and has been disabled.

"\n\nChaosbane is an isometric action role-playing game developed and published by Ebb Software. Players take control of an agent of the Order of Magni to defeat hordes of orcs and monsters in order to save the world from the god of chaos. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 30, 2019.\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nPlayers select a character from four different classes - the fighter, wizard, cleric, and rogue - and battle across a number of locations, defeating various enemies and bosses along the way. Upon defeating a certain number of enemies, players can use crystals to level up their character's attributes and skills, but if they die, they will lose a portion of their experience. Players can also switch characters at any time if they wish.[1]\n\nSynopsis [ edit ]\n\nThe game takes place in the realm of Magni. In the first chapter, which is set centuries prior to the events of the main story, three dragons - Wrath, the red one, Wrath-corrupted, the green one, and Wrath's Shadow, the blue one - team up with the Order of Magni to defeat the god of chaos. The story then jumps ahead to the present day, in which the hero is tasked with discovering what happened to the Order of Magni and saving the world from the god of chaos.[1]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nChaosbane was developed by Ebb Software and published by Bigben Interactive, with support from Cyanide Studio, and the game's music was composed by Olivier Derivière, who also worked on titles such as Obduction, Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, and the Styx: Shards of Darkness. It is the first video game to be released by Ebb Software. It is built on the Unreal Engine 4 and was built using the Unreal Editor. The game was first announced on March 19, 2018, and a closed beta was announced in August 2018, with the Xbox One version being tested by console players.[2][3][4][5][6][7] The game's title was originally going to be Chaosbane, but it was later changed to Chaosbane: Complete Edition. This is due to the studio \"really believing in the project\" and \"that the player deserved the best possible game.\"[8]\n\nThe game's digital deluxe edition and special edition, which was limited to 1,500 copies and released only in Germany, came with a Collector's Edition box, a special guidebook called the Codex of the Order, an Orc hunter statue, and a 10.1-inch figurine of the Orc shaman Leshrac.[9][10][11]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nChaosbane received \"generally favorable reviews\", according to review aggregator Metacritic.[12][13][14]\n\nThe game's cooperative play, character classes, and amount of content received praise from Hardcore Gamer, saying it's \"worth the purchase, whether it’s solo or with a group of friends. Just try to resist the urge to rage-quit.\"[16]\n\nOn the other hand, PC Gamer criticized the game's lack of character development, saying \"The dialogue is the first, and worst, indication that Chaosbane is primarily a game designed for the player’s fun. Like every game with a multiplayer focus, the writing is more there to set up the next quip than it is to create a cohesive or interesting narrative.\"[15]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>“Mr. Lazlo is a licensed and insured home inspector serving Central New Jersey.

"Kitakata Castle\n\nIt is located in the north-east corner of the town of Kitakata, in the middle of a busy commercial and residential district. There are over 100 buildings within the castle area, some of which date to the 16th century.\n\nThe current castle was built by Lord Takanashi Tadatoshi, a grandson of Tadamasa by his second son Tadatoshi, in 1593, when he moved from Edo. The castle was built to fend off the frequent attacks from the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but after the castle fell into Hideyoshi's hands in 1597, he returned the castle to Tadatoshi in 1598. Tadatoshi ruled the area until his death in 1608, when his son Tadakatsu took over, and in 1615, Tadakatsu and his son Tadakiyo moved the domain to Yonezawa Domain in Dewa Province, taking many retainers and craftsmen with them.\n\nThe castle survived intact until the Meiji period, when the buildings were torn down to build a school, with the stone walls being sold as material for a new Shinto shrine. In 1945, an extensive excavation was carried out, but the process was not well documented.\n\nThe site was listed as a National Historic Site in 2001.\n\nThe castle remains were fully excavated between 1980 and 1984, and included 24 structures in total. Many were reassembled on site. The castle was a yagura-style four-story donjon, and is considered to be the earliest example of this style in Tohoku. Its area was 25,000 square meters, and it is estimated that its height was 31 meters.\n\nThe only structures from the castle to survive are the Gate of Peace, the Sword House, and a well. There is also a reconstruction of the Well of Grace. The gardens have also been restored, and there is a path around the castle with information on the structures.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Nasal cavity\n\nThe nasal cavity is the cavity located in the middle of the face inside the nose.\n\nThe nasal cavity is also referred to as the nasal airway.\n\nThis cavity communicates with the outside through the nostrils, also called nares, and is lined with skin. It has a series of bony shelves called conchae (singular: concha) which help to filter air during inhalation and to warm and humidify the air during exhalation.\n\nThe nasal cavity can also be divided into three distinct sections: the vestibule, the middle meatus, and the anterior meatus.\n\nThe nasal cavity receives:\n\nNasal conchae are small, irregular bony projections into the nasal cavity that help to warm and humidify air.\n\nOn each side, the lateral nasal wall has three or four of these, which project from the inferior margin of the orbit and of the zygomatic process, to the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and constitute the superior, middle and inferior meatuses of the nose.\n\nThe lateral wall is the wall of the nasal cavity located on the lateral side of the nose.\n\n\nThe anterior nasal spine (or anterior nasal concha) is the bony ridge located on the middle nasal concha on the inferior portion of the lateral nasal wall.\n\nIt is about 5 mm long and 2 mm thick and is the remnant of the cartilage of the embryonic nasal capsule.\n\nThe medial nasal wall is the wall of the nasal cavity located on the medial side of the nose.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Rössler attractor\n\nThe Rössler attractor (or Rössler system, named after Heinz-Otto Rössler) is a chaotic attractor found in systems governed by a nonlinear difference equation. The Rössler attractor is typically used to model chaotic motion in biological and physical systems.\n\nThe Rössler attractor was the first chaotic attractor ever to be discovered. Its existence was first suspected in 1963 by David Ruelle, who was studying differential equations of the form formula_1. He soon began to suspect that certain equations of this form were capable of generating chaotic behaviour. It was Rössler, however, who first proved that this was indeed the case.\n\nAn example of a simple equation of this form, in which the nonlinearity is the derivative, is\n\nIn the case of formula_3, this equation has the solution\n\nwhich clearly exhibits chaotic behaviour. For certain values of formula_5 and formula_6, however, the solution can exhibit regular behaviour, as illustrated below. The precise values that cause this to occur depend on the parameters of the equation.\n\nFor these values of formula_5 and formula_6, the solution takes the form\n\nformula_9\n\nformula_10\n\nformula_11\n\nThis solution repeats itself in a periodic manner, meaning that in this case the attractor is a period attractor. As the formula_5 and formula_6 parameters vary, the solution's behaviour can change from periodic to chaotic.\n\nThere are many methods available for computing the Rössler attractor. The first of these methods, and the most straightforward, is an algorithm that was proposed by H.O. Rössler in the original paper in which the attractor was described. This algorithm essentially consists of an algorithm for computing the vector field for the differential equation, followed by an algorithm for drawing the curves in the resulting vector field.\n\nGiven a differential equation of the form\n\nformula_15\n\nformula_16\n\nformula_17\n\nthen the equation has a unique solution in the vector field formula_18 of the form\n\nformula_19\n\nwhere formula_20 is the Kronecker delta function.\n\nThe Rössler algorithm for the vector field is as follows:\n\nIf the resulting vector field has dimension formula_22, then it is a point in a formula_22-dimensional space. Therefore, in this case, the attractor is a formula_22-dimensional space.\n\nIf the resulting vector field has dimension less than formula_22, then the algorithm can be repeated, as described below.\n\nGiven the vector field formula_26, the Rössler algorithm for the curve is as follows:\n\nGiven an initial point formula_30, the first step of this algorithm finds the vector formula_31 that has the minimum value in the space defined by the vector field formula_18.\n\nIn the case of the example given above, the vector field has dimension formula_22. Therefore, there are formula_22 vectors that can be used as initial points.\n\nLet formula_35 be an initial point. Then the curve defined by the vector formula_31 is called the Rössler curve.\n\nThe example above shows the result of using an initial point that is formula_37. The corresponding Rössler curve is illustrated below.\n\nAs the vector formula_31 varies, the Rössler curve traces out a line. For certain values of formula_31, the curve traces out a line that contains a great deal of structure.\n\nFor formula_31 values in which the curve traces out a line that does not have a great deal of structure, the Rössler algorithm can be repeated. The algorithm can be repeated as many times as necessary to produce a curve that contains the desired structure.\n\nThe Rössler algorithm has been implemented by many authors in a variety of software packages.\n\nThere are a variety of methods available for computing the attractor itself. The simplest of these methods involves repeating the procedure for computing the vector field. The attractor consists of the curve traced out by the point formula_31 in the vector field formula_18.\n\nGiven a vector field formula_18, a point formula_31, and a time formula_46, then the attractor at time formula_46 is the curve traced out by formula_31 in the vector field formula_18.\n\nGiven a system of differential equations of the form\n\nformula_51\n\nformula_52\n\nformula_53\n\nthe attractor of this system is the Rössler attractor formula_54.\n\nGiven a vector field formula_18, a point formula_31, and a time formula_46, then the attractor at time formula_46 is the curve traced out by formula_31 in the vector field formula_18.\n\nGiven a set of parameter values, the attractor can be computed by iterating this procedure for a sufficient number of time steps.\n\nThere are a variety of methods available for computing the attractor itself.

S. Van Dyke and starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, the film is about a prince of an impoverished European country who wants to marry a commoner instead of a royal from a wealthy country. The film also features a young Jane Wyatt and Charles Coburn.\n\nPrince Alexander of the kingdom of Salzburg and his best friend Bertrand De Vries travel to Paris, where they find themselves short of money. When Alexander runs into moneylender Poirot, who is holding a letter of credit he gave to Bertrand, he tells him that he and Bertrand are French. Poirot asks him to participate in a robbery of the Louvre, with Alexander providing a distraction.\n\nDuring the crime, the two men and some accomplices knock out museum guard Roux, and Alexander dons his uniform. However, Alexander has been spotted by the museum director, Poirot, and policeman Jules Pujol. Alexander flees, but is arrested. As the two men attempt to get Alexander back to the Louvre, they get in a car accident. Pujol rescues Alexander and escorts him to the hospital, but cannot find his partner.\n\nMeanwhile, Alexander wakes up to find himself nursed by Jacqueline Dessalines, a young American woman. In the confusion, Alexander had told Jacqueline that he is the crown prince of Austria, and that he will make her his queen when they return to his country.\n\nWhile the real prince is having plastic surgery to repair the damage done to his face, Alexander and Jacqueline fall in love. However, she does not believe he is a prince. At the same time, two of his friends who were involved in the robbery attempt to woo Jacqueline as a way of keeping her quiet.\n\nMeanwhile, when his plastic surgery is complete, Alexander returns to his father, the king, and asks for money so that he can marry Jacqueline. The king says he will only give him the money if he first marries a woman from an extremely wealthy family. Alexander manages to persuade the father of an extremely rich woman, Madame de Cabriac, to lend him a dowry for his fictitious bride.\n\nAt the wedding, Jacqueline realizes Alexander is marrying another woman. At the reception, the jealous Jacqueline takes an apple and tries to throw it at Alexander. The police, who have been searching for the criminal Alexander, burst in and believe that Jacqueline is the one who tried to throw the apple. She is arrested. The police captain asks Madame de Cabriac to identify the prince, but the prince claims to be \"Gaston de France\". The real Gaston de France shows up at that moment.\n\nIn the jail, Jacqueline recognizes Pujol and asks him to get her out. When Pujol sees Alexander, he immediately realizes he has been fooled. He sneaks into the prince's room and gets the plastic surgery records from the hospital, and Pujol takes Alexander to the jail.\n\nMadame de Cabriac arrives and accuses Alexander of impersonating Gaston. However, the real Gaston shows up with the records. Madame de Cabriac is exposed as a fraud herself, since she claimed to be a member of the de Cabriac family when she was actually an orphan named Annie Duveau.\n\nThe film ends with Jacqueline getting the real Gaston, and Alexander getting Jacqueline.\n\n\nA popular singing group at the time, Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald starred together in a number of films, and this one was no exception. Other films they starred together in included \"Rose Marie\" (1936), \"Sweethearts\" (1938) and \"Bitter Sweet\" (1940).\n\nThe film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Music, Original Song for \"A Toast to Romance\" by Richard A. Whiting and Johnny Mercer, and Best Music, Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. The song \"The End of a Perfect Day\" by Herbert Stothart was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song but lost out to \"You'll Never Know\" by Richard A. Whiting and Raymond Egan for the film \"Love Affair\".\n\nThe film was remade as a musical in 1948, starring MacDonald and Eddy once again.\n\nThe film was adapted into a radio play on the September 20, 1947, broadcast of \"Screen Director's Playhouse\" with Van Johnson and Angela Lansbury in the roles played by MacDonald and Eddy in the film.\n\n\nStreaming audio\n<|endoftext|>The Draw (soundtrack)\n\nThe Draw is the soundtrack album for the film \"The Draw\" (2000), starring Ryan Phillippe and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nWhile the film received a negative critical response, the soundtrack was well received.\n\nAfter production of the film wrapped in 1999, Gus Van Sant approached Brian Reitzell about composing the soundtrack for \"The Draw\". Reitzell had previously worked with Van Sant on \"To Die For\" (1995), for which he also acted as an assistant music editor. Van Sant later recalled that he enjoyed \"the music [Reitzell] was making as a musician,\" and therefore hired him as the film's composer.\n\nThe soundtrack album was released on March 7, 2000, through Capitol Records. \"The Draw\" was the first soundtrack album on which Reitzell was credited as a composer. In the album's liner notes, he recalled, \"I remember having to finish the film pretty quick and it being a rough cut when I first watched it.\" He added that he \"didn't know what to do and [so] started recording pieces of it to see what [he] would come up with. As it came together, [he] started to think about how [he] could create an album around these soundscapes.\"\n\nFor the soundtrack album, Reitzell recorded approximately 45 minutes of instrumental tracks. \"It was all just done in [Reitzell's] bedroom,\" according to Van Sant. Van Sant did not listen to"
"The unit\n\nFor most of this article, we’ll be focusing on one single computer system: an HP Pavilion Elite HPE-335f. It's an interesting machine that bridges the gap between high-end workstations and lower-cost multimedia systems.\n\nThe system comes with an Intel Core i7-870 2.93GHz processor, 6GB of RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and an Nvidia GeForce GT230 video card. With all of the RAM and a 2GB video card, this system could run most games on the market, but there are a few weaknesses that we’ll be taking advantage of during our experiment.\n\nThe power supplies\n\nLet’s talk about power supplies. The Elite HPE-335f comes with a 460W power supply. This is one of the worst power supplies you can get, but is unfortunately one of the best ones for this experiment. Why is it bad? We’ll talk about that in a bit.\n\nThe power supply is not well-regarded in the hardware world because it has some serious design flaws that make it inefficient, which means it wastes power. That also means it produces a lot of heat, which means that it will use even more power, which means that it will waste even more power.\n\nIf you’re wondering, this is why the power supply is a little hotter than usual. But it is not the source of our problem.\n\nThe problem\n\nThe problem is that the power supply’s fan is also weak and poorly mounted. It is a plastic fan, not a metal one, so it’s no surprise that it can’t keep up with the heat that the system is producing.\n\nNow, instead of making the fan stronger, the company (which is a common practice in the industry) tried to use a resistor to reduce the fan speed. Here’s the thing: That resistor can only handle a certain amount of power, and the fan pulls a lot of power. When you put them together, the system that controls the fan, a simple transistor, burns out.\n\nThis is an easy fix: Just replace the transistor with another one that can handle more power. The problem is that this is not something that you can just get at your local electronics store. You have to know what to look for and you have to be able to find it. Luckily, I knew what to look for and I knew where to find it.\n\nThe project\n\nWe did a quick test to see if we could reduce the heat coming from the power supply by slowing down the fan. This was done using a transistor that I bought for $5. The transistor, a 2N2222, took the place of the existing transistor, a 1N4148. The 1N4148 has a limit of 150mW power draw, while the 2N2222 can handle up to 400mW.\n\nWe did the test on a completely cold system and it showed some promise. The power supply fan did slow down a little, and the unit became noticeably quieter. However, the system would become warm after a while.\n\nThen we decided to turn up the heat on the system to see if the system would slow down the fan even more. We did this by overclocking the processor. It increased the power draw from the CPU and heated up the system even more, but we were able to see a more dramatic effect. We were now able to turn the fan down to about 50 percent, and the machine was noticeably quieter.\n\nAnd what’s the cost?\n\nThe good news is that the 1N4148s are plentiful. They’re not common, but you can buy them on the Internet. One of them is going to cost you about a quarter, and if you replace all of them, it will cost you less than $2 to fix. This is a huge difference when compared to buying a new power supply for $60 or more.\n\nNow, there are a few things you should know before you do this.\n\nThe risks\n\nThe first risk is the most obvious. If you are not a tech-savvy person, you can fry the entire power supply. If you are not a competent person, you can fry the entire system. If you are not an electrical engineer, you can cause a fire and hurt someone. This is not a toy.\n\nIf you know what you’re doing and you’re careful, it’s a safe procedure. Just be smart about it.\n\nAlso, this mod is not for your office. Even though it's cheaper than a new power supply, it still costs money and you need to be careful about the dangers.\n\nThere’s one more problem that we haven’t covered, and that’s the fact that you’ll have to open up the unit. A power supply is very sensitive, and you’ll need to open up the case to get to the power supply. This can cause problems with your warranty, which could cause problems for you. This mod is for home users, not for offices.\n\nThis mod is not for your office. Even though it's cheaper than a new power supply, it still costs money and you need to be careful about the dangers.\n\nYou will also have to open up the unit, so there are some concerns about warranty. You will void the warranty if you open it up, so keep that in mind before you take this project on.\n\nTime for a fix\n\nWe have a few fixes for this problem, but we’ll only talk about two. The first one is a solution from someone named Ian over on the hardware review site bit-tech. The second one is a much cheaper solution from an enthusiast named Adam.\n\nThe Ian solution\n\nYou have to replace the 1N4148 transistor with a 2N7000, which can handle up to 700mW of power. This will cost you about $2 and you should be able to do this fix in about 10 minutes. This is the best solution that we can give you.\n\nThe Adam solution\n\nThe second fix is a little more complex and a little cheaper. This fix is a little cheaper because you’ll have to buy a chip that costs about $10. Then you have to burn the firmware for that chip. Adam actually did this and wrote a detailed article about the process. The result is an upgraded power supply that doesn’t have the problem we’re looking at.\n\nSo there you have it. You have a fix for your HP Pavilion Elite HPE-335f. It’s a cheap fix and will give you a quiet, cool computer.\n\nGood luck!<|endoftext|>There was another “fantastic” sale at the world’s largest online vendor, Amazon.com, but it was not as good as the Black Friday 2014 sale.

"Used to it all\n\nThere is an ongoing debate in my family about the origin of the word “cowboy.” We know the term was originally used to describe a herder or drover of cattle. Some of my family maintains it was coined in Spain, describing the Mexican or Spanish version of those workers.\n\nMy father’s family, on the other hand, insists the term was used by Anglo cowboys to describe the tough but generally peaceful herders or drovers.\n\nThe debate came up again a few weeks ago when we went to watch “Lone Ranger” with my father and his wife, my stepmother, Barb. The man riding the white horse was a sheriff, not a cowboy, they insisted.\n\nI finally admitted I didn’t really care where the term came from and we all had a good laugh over it.\n\nWhen we were kids, the most important part of the “Lone Ranger” program was the William Tell Overture. My father used to march us out of the living room after it was over, saying it was time to wash up for supper. The silly thing is, even as a kid, I was always aware the William Tell Overture was from an opera. I never realized it was from a Rossini opera.\n\nIn those days we watched “Lone Ranger” every Saturday, and the William Tell Overture was part of every episode.\n\nI hadn’t seen the program for a very long time. I knew there was a new movie coming out, and my dad had seen it. He was pretty pleased with it and wanted us to go see it. He had promised my husband and I a date night.\n\nI thought the new movie was fine. I liked the opening scene where William Tell is trapped in an apple barrel. That is the part that is used in the William Tell Overture. I also enjoyed the rope bridge, and I liked that the bad guys weren’t all bad.\n\nWe liked the white horse. I could tell he was an Appaloosa because of the splashes of color on his back. The horse was definitely a character.\n\nWhat I really liked was that the movie gave us a glimpse of the America that exists only in memories. The one that was so much like that TV show, with men on white horses riding up and down the street.\n\nWe laughed because one of the bad guys in the new movie had a name I hadn’t heard in a long time. Bat Masterson.\n\nI have to admit, though, there was a little bit of apprehension when it came to watching the old “Lone Ranger” program. We were worried it would be too corny. It wasn’t. The Lone Ranger in the new movie was funny, too. The guy with the camera on the white horse was too.\n\nThe problem with the “Lone Ranger” program in those days was the William Tell Overture. Even the TV version was cut, so we could get on with our Saturday-evening chores.\n\nNow I know why my dad didn’t want us to watch the program. We might have been swayed to do something we didn’t have time to do.\n\n“Lone Ranger” was on television in the 1950s and ’60s. It has been playing on television ever since. It’s still on my DVR. I think I will watch it this week.\n\n– Mary Bilyeu is the Register’s senior editor.

Very nice, except that I don't want to put the caulk gun on it, and I have a new colander that I want to stick into the sink, but it is too heavy to use with my usual suction cup colander holder. A regular one with a handle would work, but then I would need a magnet to hold it, and I thought why not put a magnet on the side of the new colander. It works very well, and the only problem is the handle. It is painted wood, so it doesn't hold the magnet as well as metal, but it does hold it. It isn't glued or anything, I just hold it with my finger tips, which are pretty strong. And, I just found out that my Wusthof has a magnet in the bottom, so I may stick that in the sink. I used the colander that I was using, and as I said, I just hold it in place, I don't put the magnet on the colander itself. You can see in the pic that I have a red rubber thing to protect the wood and make a little ledge for the colander to sit on, so it doesn't sink into the wood. It will last a long time, and will come off easily, so I can replace it when the need arises. A great idea that I picked up on Food Network (while on the exercise bike).\n\n\n\nAnd, I think the saying is \"never put off until tomorrow what you can do today\". I started by looking for the magnet that I use on the metal lip of the sink in my kitchen in Colorado, then the fridge, etc. It was not where I thought it should be, so I decided to do it now, rather than spend more time looking. And, I got to use my new waffle maker and got the advantage of the break in, I got to break it in, so now I know how it will work for me, and it is going to work great!\n\n\n\nKathleen<|endoftext|>Breaking up is hard to do, even when you're not talking to each other.

These and other surveys, including some work conducted in the early 1950s, resulted in a good understanding of the region’s geological and geophysical potential.<|endoftext|>Teaching Little Learners Online\n\nWant to teach younger students?

A big number in anyone’s book. As it happens, the headline was pretty misleading, as the article went on to explain that the Bank was hoping that this money would act as a “put option” for financial institutions (e.g. banks, building societies etc.), allowing them to pass on the benefit of these low rates to consumers, and ultimately to stimulate the real economy.\n\nThe point is that the same thing can be achieved by having higher rates. So in that sense, QE is not really about “p"
"Much of the history of the U.S. Department of the Interior and its predecessor agencies is presented in a new exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). \"In the Nation's Service: 150 Years of the U.S. Department of the Interior\" (March 27, 2010 – September 3, 2012) tells the story of a department charged with overseeing a complex web of activities such as wildlife and fish management, national parks, and mining, oil and gas leasing. The exhibit, located in the museum's West Hall of American Indians, tells the story of how Congress established the Department of the Interior in 1849 to take control of the huge amounts of federal land being acquired in the young country. It also showcases the many changes the department has undergone over the years.\n\nThe National Museum of Natural History, part of the Smithsonian Institution, holds the world's largest collection of natural history specimens and human artifacts. Over the years, the museum has produced a number of temporary and permanent exhibits that highlight different aspects of its collections. Some of the more famous exhibits have included the Apollo 16 Command Module, the George Washington Exhibit Hall (first opened in 1923), and the Hall of North American Forests (first opened in 1993).\n\nThe museum's current \"In the Nation's Service: 150 Years of the U.S. Department of the Interior\" exhibit was created in association with the National Museum of the American Indian, the Minerals Management Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It celebrates the department's past, present, and future with photos, maps, and text highlighting many of the historic events that have shaped the department and its predecessors over the last 150 years. The exhibit also includes the \"Interior Department at a Glance,\" which provides a comprehensive view of the department's numerous responsibilities.\n\nThis exhibit replaces \"Our Land,\" a temporary exhibit which ran from February 2009 through February 2010. The new exhibit focuses on the Department of the Interior's role in managing public lands and resources, along with its historical precedents.\n\nImage courtesy of flickr user cveiga\n\nAny views or opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect those of ActionHub.

I saw that two alliances were in mortal combat and the planes fought in the sky, and on the ground fierce battles of armored vehicles. When I asked what's going on, and how many, people laughed and did not understand.\n\n\n\nSeveral times I dreamed about wars and conflicts, in which people are killed. I watched the film \"Exodus\" with the images of the first world war and woke up sobbing. At night I often had a dream, which I again lived a drama, as if in real life. I always dream of the night, even though sometimes a dream I've been able to predict. I'm often asleep in the house that looks different from real. One of the main topics of my dreams are past life and astral, I remember them very well, and not remember the life of the day.\n\n\n\nLast dream (last dream was in 2005)\n\n\n\nMy dream was a war. At this time, I was a military intelligence officer, I have been one before. At the beginning of the dream we all lived a day and continued to work as usual. Then there was a powerful attack on our position, where I worked, and the building was destroyed. After this I was lying on the floor of a room, covered with debris and watched the battle, which raged in the street, along which I lay. I watched how an armored vehicle, came to me and moved away the debris from me. A man who sat behind the wheel and fired machine guns. As he saw that I am alive, he called me out of the rubble and drove away. Then we got to an uninhabited village, where he showed me the headquarters of his unit, which is also in this village. After this, I saw the other people, some of them were from my unit and we were discussing our plans. Then we went to a meeting with the commander of the alliance in which we were, and we asked him how to defend against attacks, which took us by surprise. The commander told us that he did not want to talk to us and we had to go back to work. Then I went back to work with people from my unit and discussed with them. Then we went back to the place where we were before. Here we began to dig in the ground. We hid in the holes and were waiting for the next attack. The next attack came, this time the enemies were even more numerous. We were armed only with a small hand-held guns, but we tried to defend ourselves. During the fight we were trying to dig a new shelter, to hide there, but the enemy has seen us and came closer. We had to get into the holes, which we dug earlier. Soon the enemy has found us, he has dropped some kind of incendiary bombs and we were forced to hide. In the holes were many people, but not all, but some people were killed. The attack ended and I was still alive. Soon there was another attack, the enemy was everywhere. We could not shoot at the enemy, because there were many people in the ground. After some time there was an explosion of the ground and it turned out that we had a secret base in the ground, where there were all the weapons and ammunition. When I realized this, I was surprised. The enemy noticed that we have disappeared from the surface, but the path to the base was still open. We began to shoot, but we were almost powerless. I sat in the house and decided to commit suicide with a hand grenade. I thought about it for a long time and even pulled the pin, but at this time I woke up. The dream was so powerful, that when I woke up, I immediately felt as if it all had happened. When I woke up, my head hurt. I checked the hands, but I didn't feel any strange things. I wondered if I had come to the afterlife, but no, when I touched my head I felt my fingers and it all seemed real.<|endoftext|>The Byzantine empire as presented in this series is based on a more realistic understanding of the medieval, but some of the characters do not reflect this, especially among the military, and some do not even have Greek or Slavic names. They may also be more modern than the rest of the series, but the names should all be correct. See more\n\nGoofs\n\nIn episode 2 of series 2 a pig's blood is used to soak some of the archers. However this practice was not in use until the 14th century, as this was the only way to stop the enemy from continuing to fire at them, and was not used until longbows became standard. In earlier warfare (late Roman and through the medieval period) the best way to defend from arrows was to have a shield and armour, or to crouch down. Thus it is unlikely that a battle with this many archers, who are able to kill most of the other characters (including one who could have helped the wounded) would resort to this in the 12th century, especially as arrows do not appear to be that hard to kill.

"EAST LONGMEADOW – When the spring arrived, snow was still piled in banks on the sides of roadways. Last year's drought was still firmly in the minds of those who had suffered through the summer with little or no rain.\n\nIn the winter, Gov. Deval L. Patrick was a frequent visitor to the state's east and central portions of the state as he toured the areas ravaged by back-to-back blizzards.\n\nBy the time the late spring came, it was Gov. Patrick who was looking for the rain.\n\nAs 2012 wound to a close, the state was mired in its fifth straight year of below average rainfall and an unseasonably dry fall.\n\nPatrick has declared that he's not optimistic that the drought will end soon.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be a good year,\" Patrick said last week. \"And this year is not going to be a good year. Next year may be a good year. We're still looking at the effects of the drought.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday, less than 5 inches of rain had fallen in the state since the beginning of the year. At this time in 2011, it had been a little more than 9 inches of rain and two years ago, 11 inches.\n\nIn December alone, rainfall totaled less than 1/2 inch, while December of 2011 saw almost an inch and a half of precipitation and in 2010, it was more than 2 inches.\n\nThe rain, or lack of it, has helped to turn the state's streams and rivers into trickles in many cases and made for some epic mud holes.\n\nThe effects of the drought are also being felt in water levels in ponds and lakes, including Lake Pontoosuc and Lake Quinsigamond, both in the Longmeadow section of the state.\n\nIn December, water levels in Pontoosuc and Quinsigamond were at 18 percent and 8 percent of capacity respectively, both well below their historic low points in 1989 and 1997.\n\nLast winter, water levels at both lakes fell more than two feet and officials say it is unlikely that the levels will return to their average this winter.\n\nThe level of Lake Quinsigamond has been further reduced by the water department's decision to close the city's water intake pipe near the lake. The move was prompted by the city's concerns over the integrity of the intake system.\n\nMayor Michael D. Bissonnette said last week that the city had received \"dozens and dozens of calls\" from residents about the lack of water.\n\n\"We have been getting complaints from people saying that their water pressure has been going down,\" he said.\n\n\"We're still getting water. We're pumping from Westfield now. But it's been a difficult winter for everyone. It's definitely the worst winter I've seen in my 20 years as mayor.\"\n\nThe mayor said he expects that water levels will drop further as the winter continues.\n\n\"Right now we're taking out of the lake as much water as we possibly can,\" he said.\n\n\"We're running three pumps 24 hours a day. That's as much as we can do right now. But we could only run two pumps in the past.\"\n\nHowever, the mayor said he is optimistic that the water level in the lake will rise once the spring arrives.\n\n\"The last three years have been the driest in history,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't think we'll get a flood, but we do think the water level will go up.\"\n\nIn June, the state is expected to receive a $2 million grant from the federal government for emergency drinking water projects, including possible improvements to the city's system, which has more than 30 miles of water mains and more than 40 fire hydrants.\n\nBissonnette said he's hopeful the grant will be approved.\n\n\"It's something that I think is a necessary project,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it would be an improvement and will help.\"\n\nLike the other communities across the state, the city's water system is aging and is in need of repairs.\n\n\"That's something we're hoping to address over the next few years,\" Bissonnette said.\n\nMeanwhile, on the state's northern coast, the tide at the Cape Cod Canal was rising Tuesday, bringing the possibility of a higher level of the waterway in the next few days.\n\nThe Canal is on the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency's list of water-supply sources in case the region's aquifers are depleted or in danger of being depleted.\n\nAnd this past week, the agency said that the last of four generators at the Mount Tom Pumping Station near Holyoke, which serves the Chicopee, Westfield and Holyoke water systems, was repaired and is working again.\n\nThe agency said that the problem that has prevented the pump from being repaired for the past month is being attributed to frozen water in the pipes that resulted in damage to some of the equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick said he hopes that the state will see rain this weekend.\n\n\"If it's a big rain, it will help,\" he said. \"But it's going to take more than one or two good rainfalls. We need more than that to turn it around.\"<|endoftext|>Number of selected few (16) Number of selected many (55) Number of selected others (23)\n\nNumber of selected few (20) Number of selected many (52) Number of selected others (14)\n\nNumber of selected few (14) Number of selected many (44) Number of selected others (20)\n\nNumber of selected few (6) Number of selected many (46) Number of selected others (18)\n\nNumber of selected few (12) Number of selected many (43) Number of selected others (14)\n\nNumber of selected few (14) Number of selected many (41) Number of selected others (15)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (39) Number of selected others (21)\n\nNumber of selected few (16) Number of selected many (35) Number of selected others (15)\n\nNumber of selected few (14) Number of selected many (32) Number of selected others (11)\n\nNumber of selected few (16) Number of selected many (31) Number of selected others (9)\n\nNumber of selected few (7) Number of selected many (29) Number of selected others (13)\n\nNumber of selected few (10) Number of selected many (27) Number of selected others (16)\n\nNumber of selected few (13) Number of selected many (25) Number of selected others (13)\n\nNumber of selected few (11) Number of selected many (25) Number of selected others (11)\n\nNumber of selected few (9) Number of selected many (23) Number of selected others (13)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (20) Number of selected others (11)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (18) Number of selected others (10)\n\nNumber of selected few (7) Number of selected many (17) Number of selected others (10)\n\nNumber of selected few (6) Number of selected many (15) Number of selected others (9)\n\nNumber of selected few (9) Number of selected many (15) Number of selected others (10)\n\nNumber of selected few (6) Number of selected many (14) Number of selected others (10)\n\nNumber of selected few (11) Number of selected many (14) Number of selected others (8)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (14) Number of selected others (9)\n\nNumber of selected few (11) Number of selected many (14) Number of selected others (7)\n\nNumber of selected few (12) Number of selected many (14) Number of selected others (9)\n\nNumber of selected few (11) Number of selected many (13) Number of selected others (8)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (12) Number of selected others (10)\n\nNumber of selected few (13) Number of selected many (12) Number of selected others (9)\n\nNumber of selected few (9) Number of selected many (11) Number of selected others (10)\n\nNumber of selected few (7) Number of selected many (10) Number of selected others (8)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (9) Number of selected others (7)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (8) Number of selected others (8)\n\nNumber of selected few (9) Number of selected many (8) Number of selected others (6)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (7) Number of selected others (6)\n\nNumber of selected few (9) Number of selected many (7) Number of selected others (5)\n\nNumber of selected few (10) Number of selected many (6) Number of selected others (4)\n\nNumber of selected few (9) Number of selected many (6) Number of selected others (4)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many (6) Number of selected others (4)\n\nNumber of selected few (6) Number of selected many (6) Number of selected others (3)\n\nNumber of selected few (9) Number of selected many (5) Number of selected others (3)\n\nNumber of selected few (8) Number of selected many ("

But if it's anything like the last time the WA-based HMAS Stirling's \"Seekers\" unit was called to the southern Indian Ocean, it could be a lengthy, drawn-out and ultimately fruitless task. HMAS Stirling's Submarine Escape and Rescue Section was deployed in early November last year to aid the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and specialist United States salvage teams in their hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Despite an exhaustive air and sea search, the team failed to find any trace of the Boeing 777-200, which had disappeared on March 8, 2014 while on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The four-month search, the most expensive in aviation history, ended on January 29 with authorities ruling that the aircraft had crashed into the Indian Ocean, leaving all 239 people on board dead.

With over one hundred buildings located in the Ross Dependency of Antarctica, McMurdo Station is the largest community on the continent.\n\nThe main body of the station lies on the shore of McMurdo Sound, which is located on the coast of Victoria Land. The station is named after the explorer, Lieutenant Archibald McMurdo. He was a participant in the British expedition led by James Clark Ross to the Antarctic.\n\nThe British explorer Robert Falcon Scott also participated in the Ross expedition. He discovered the body of Lieutenant Edward Adrian Wilson, which lay next to a makeshift grave on Hut Point. He died while accompanying Scott on his first expedition to the South Pole. Wilson was a member of the McMurdo-Scott party.\n\nMcMurdo Station has been used by scientists since 1956. The first summer-only research base, named Base E, was opened in 1955. It was built on the upper reaches of the McMurdo Ice Shelf, about 4.5 kilometers from the present station.\n\nThe Base E site was selected in 1954 and built over the next two years by the men of the U.S. Navy. The men came from the ships of the U.S. 7th Fleet, and named their home after Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who established the first Antarctic base, in the Bay of Whales in 1929.\n\nThe first winter-only field camp was established by the United States Army in 1955, at the suggestion of Admiral Byrd. The camp, called Deep Freeze I, was located at the foot of the Dry Valleys, in Wilkes Land, about 150 kilometers inland from the Antarctic coast.\n\nThe station is often used as a scientific field camp for short periods of time, in conjunction with long-term expeditions to the area. Some of the research projects currently being conducted at McMurdo Station include:\n\n• studying the East Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\n• examining the soils and plant life of the Antarctic continent\n\n• researching the chemical reactions of hydrochloric acid on sea salt\n\n• learning more about the effects of climate change on the Antarctic environment\n\nMcMurdo Station features a small hospital that is staffed by two doctors, a dentist, a physician’s assistant and two registered nurses. There is also a small medical clinic located in Scott Base, as well as a dispensary located at a camp set up by the United States Antarctic Program.\n\nFor more than forty years, McMurdo Station was the largest base in Antarctica. In January, 2010, the new Russian research station called the “Shackleton” was opened in the heart of the Antarctic continent. The Russian station features one hundred and twenty-four beds, making it the largest base in the region.\n\nPhoto credit: Michael Melford/National Science Foundation<|endoftext|>Tales of Zestiria - Alisha Islet Dungeon\n\nThis week's new Tales of Zestiria video introduces Alisha, a previously announced character who's a bit of a selfish princess but also kind-hearted.

Asa Hutchinson, a Republican. Arkansas was the 15th state to ban the procedure known medically as dilation and evacuation.\n\nUS District Court Judge Kristine Baker issued a preliminary, permanent injunction against the state that bars enforcement of the restrictions, including a ban on abortions that involve more than one physician. Baker said the requirements would impose a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.\n\nBaker said in her ruling that a woman would be facing \"some of the most severe, indeed desperate, circumstances imaginable.\"\n\nBaker issued her ruling late Wednesday but it wasn't clear when she would issue a final decision on the constitutionality of the 12-week ban. She noted that Planned Parenthood had presented enough evidence that it was entitled to a preliminary injunction against the measure.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Great Plains spokeswoman Emily Wales said the injunction was a win for Arkansas women and families.\n\n\"Planned Parenthood Great Plains is committed to ensuring that patients can get the care they need and will continue to fight to protect access to safe, legal abortion in Arkansas,\" Wales said in a statement.\n\nCody Hiland, the state attorney general, said he was disappointed in the ruling and added that he would appeal Baker's decision.\n\n\"As Attorney General, I have fully defended this law at every turn and appreciate the court's decision to recognize that the State of Arkansas is on solid legal ground,\" he said.\n\nIn issuing her ruling, Baker said the state had not pointed to any evidence that the requirement that a second physician be present when a first-trimester abortion was performed would further the health or safety of a woman. She said it was \"likely to reduce the number of physicians willing to perform abortions and ... limit a woman's access to abortion services in the State.\"\n\nBaker said the new law also would impose an \"undue burden\" on a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy before viability.\n\nAnother part of the law would have banned a common second-trimester abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation. The judge said that would effectively ban abortion for some women.\n\nBaker said the U.S. Supreme Court has \"repeatedly affirmed that states may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.\"\n\nThis is the second time in a week that a federal judge has blocked Arkansas from enforcing a new abortion law. Baker issued a preliminary injunction last week that prevented Arkansas from enforcing a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation.<|endoftext|>Set 1\n\n\n\nMississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo ->\n\nFranklin's Tower ->\n\nNew Minglewood Blues\n\nPeggy-O\n\nEl Paso\n\nTennessee Jed\n\nThe Music Never Stopped\n\n\n\nSet 2\n\n\n\nTerrapin Station ->\n\nPlaying In The Band ->\n\nDrums ->\n\nSpace ->\n\nNot Fade Away ->\n\nBlack Peter ->\n\nPlaying In The Band ->\n\nOne More Saturday Night\n\n\n\nEncore\n\nCasey Jones\n\nNotes:\n\n-- Disc change is seamless\n\n-- Thanks to Joe B.

"To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to compare the accuracy of measuring BL and AL using different protocols and devices. In this study, a set of seven measurement protocols using five devices (ACCU-measure®, Biospace Vellamo, HarpScan®, i-FAST-BBL®, and the World Health Organization [WHO] body size measurement charts) were analyzed. Among these protocols, only the WHO protocol with the reference tape had a low correlation with the skin-fold method. The low correlation between the WHO protocol with the reference tape and the skin-fold method could be due to the measurement of the abdominal circumference with the tape which is done in supine position with the knees bent and the arms raised [28]. In contrast, the waist circumference is measured in the standing position with the arms extended along the body and with a goniometer, which may explain the low correlation. The reference tape may not be the appropriate measurement device for the abdominal circumference. Moreover, it is well known that abdominal circumference can change significantly in different postures and therefore measurement of the abdominal circumference by means of a tape will change in each posture [29]. The percentage of accuracy with the reference tape was the lowest among the devices used in this study (45.9%).\n\nWhen comparing the BL and AL measurements using the different protocols, the most accurate results were obtained with the protocols using the BL-4, BL-5, AL-5, and AL-6 (ACCU-measure®, Biospace Vellamo, HarpScan®, and WHO protocols, respectively) (Table 1). All the devices had a good correlation with the skin-fold method, except for the HarpScan® device with the protocol AL-1 (Table 2). The good correlation between the HarpScan® and the skin-fold method with the protocol AL-1 can be explained by the fact that both measurements are based on the measurements of the arm span. Therefore, this protocol should be considered as the easiest and most appropriate protocol to measure AL, although a reference tape should be used for all other protocols, as the correlation with the skin-fold method is excellent with this device (ACCU-measure® and Biospace Vellamo). The poor correlation between the HarpScan® device and the skin-fold method with the AL-1 protocol was also observed in a previous study [13]. The protocol AL-2 (arm span) could be considered as a better protocol for the HarpScan® device because the correlation with the skin-fold method is also good (r = 0.90). However, the correlation between the AL-2 protocol and the skin-fold method is also poor with the reference tape (r = 0.81). In a previous study, the AL-2 protocol was compared to the AL-3 protocol with the tape measure [11], but in this study, only AL-2 was compared to the skin-fold method, because AL-3 protocol is not an international standard, which could explain the lower correlation in the previous study. In the current study, AL-2 was also compared with the skin-fold method, but the correlation was lower than the correlation with the AL-3 protocol. Although a reference tape is used for this protocol, it may not be the best measurement device for measuring AL.\n\nThe World Health Organization protocol with the reference tape had the highest correlation with the skin-fold method (r = 0.97) and the best percentage of accuracy (92.2%). The correlation with the skin-fold method was also good with the Biospace Vellamo device (r = 0.91), but the device used to measure the height was not the same as the one used for the WHO protocol. The correlation between the reference tape and the AL-1 protocol was also high (r = 0.91). Therefore, the World Health Organization protocol is the best protocol to use in epidemiological studies with measurements of BL and AL. However, this protocol can be modified to improve its reliability, for example by using the head circumference, arm span, and the height instead of the arm span and the head circumference, respectively, to measure BL and AL. The WHO protocol has the potential to be recommended as an international standard because it is the simplest protocol to use, and it is easy to standardize and apply.\n\nRegarding the differences between males and females, there was a significant difference between the skin-fold method (male) and the WHO protocol (female) for AL. These results are in agreement with previous studies that found that the AL measurement between males and females is different [9, 11, 30, 31]. This difference in AL measurement between males and females can be explained by the differences in body size [9, 11, 30, 31], and it has been suggested that the differences in body size may be due to genetic factors [9]. The mean AL of males was 2.5 cm longer than that of females. In a study of school children, males had significantly greater AL than females [11], and this was also observed in an adult population [9].\n\nWhen comparing the measurements of the different protocols using the BL-5 protocol, the WHO protocol with the reference tape had the highest percentage of accuracy (96.9%) (Table 3). The lowest percentage of accuracy was obtained with the reference tape (87.9%) and the AL-1 protocol (87.1%). The lower percentage of accuracy with the reference tape and the AL-1 protocol is also found in a previous study [11]. The percentage of accuracy is influenced by the differences in height and weight, and the larger the differences between the height and weight of males and females, the lower the percentage of accuracy [9, 10, 12]. However, the percentage of accuracy obtained with the BL-5 protocol is the highest because the BL-5 protocol measures only body size, while the AL-1 protocol also measures arm span. Although the arm span is a better indicator of the body size, it is also influenced by factors such as body composition, and this may explain the lower percentage of accuracy obtained with the AL-1 protocol. In addition, the tape measures used in this study were used to measure height and weight, and this may have influenced the results because the length of the tapes was not standardized.\n\nThe correlation between the AL-1 protocol and the skin-fold method was poor with the Biospace Vellamo device (r = 0.68) (Table 2), whereas the correlation was good with the AL-2 protocol (r = 0.91). Therefore, in studies that use the Biospace Vellamo device to measure AL, the AL-2 protocol should be considered. The same protocol should also be considered for other devices, except for the HarpScan®, which is one of the few devices that can measure AL.\n\nThe use of different measurement devices for the measurement of body size has been studied by many authors, and the results are different. However, the AL measurement using a device that measures only the arm span has the best accuracy [7, 12, 13, 32]. Moreover, the results from these studies are different, and this may be due to differences in the populations studied [11], in the measurement protocols [9, 12, 13], and in the devices used to measure AL. In a study that compared the AL measurement by means of the same protocol with the same device (the reference tape), the results were similar to the results of the current study, and the best protocol was the World Health Organization protocol, which was based on the arm span and the height [9]. The highest correlation between the AL-2 protocol and the skin-fold method was obtained with the reference tape (r = 0.91) [11]. The best correlation was also obtained with the reference tape in the current study (r = 0.94). The results of the current study showed that the reference tape was the best device to use in the assessment of the accuracy of AL measurement by means of different protocols. The measurement of AL using the reference tape is not dependent on body size and may provide more reliable and accurate results [12]. The results of the current study may be useful for developing an international standard for AL measurement.<|endoftext|>The framework and development of the US Regulatory Enforcement Model\n\nAbstract\n\nRegulatory Enforcement Policy is the application of rules and regulations in a business or industry to regulate the conduct of the firm and individuals or businesses involved in the business. The enforcement policies and their extent determine the effectiveness of regulatory system. This paper evaluates the current framework of US Regulatory Enforcement Policy and the legislative proposals that have been made in the US to improve regulatory enforcement in the US. The paper also evaluates the existing US regulatory enforcement model, its success and failure, and analyzes the shortcomings and areas for improvement.\n\nKeywords\n\nExecutive summary\n\nRegulatory enforcement policy is the use of rules and regulations in an industry to regulate the conduct of the firms and individuals or businesses involved in the business. The enforcement policies and their extent determine the effectiveness of regulatory system. In an industry, the main objective of any firm is to produce more, better and faster in order to increase its profit. But there are some limits that are imposed by the government to control the output of the industry and to promote the social welfare of the society. For instance, in case of water industries, it is required that industries need to comply with certain environmental norms in order to maintain the balance of the ecosystem. These norms are determined by the government for controlling the quantity of water produced by the industry.\n\nHowever, in spite of setting the environmental norms, the government has to control the output to promote the interests of the consumers and public welfare. As a result, the government needs to enforce these rules and regulations to control the conduct of firms and individual to promote the overall public welfare. The enforcement of rules and regulations will promote the public welfare as firms will produce as per the norms set by the government. It is because of this reason that the"

We've seen already the most startling reaction in the world stock markets in history.\n\n\"It's very easy to envisage the consumer taking a pause for thought and the business community becoming more risk-averse.\"\n\nA quarter-point cut to the Bank of England base rate was expected next month but Mr Shaw said that the possibility of a recession had changed the outlook for monetary policy.\n\nHoward Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that \"even a mild recession may now be a realistic possibility\" (Bloomberg)\n\nAll four of the major forecasters, including the Bank, have cut their forecasts for UK GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 since the vote.\n\nIn its latest analysis of the short-term outlook, the EY Item Club predicted that the economy would contract by 0.1pc in the third quarter and by 0.2pc in the fourth.\n\nA separate survey of business opinion by the Institute of Directors said that the fallout from Brexit was a major concern for its members, while a separate business confidence survey by the CBI found a similar mood of pessimism.\n\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics this week showed that retail sales dropped 0.7pc in June, the sharpest fall since 2010.\n\nThe data, taken with a survey from the British Retail Consortium, pointed to a \"big squeeze on consumer spending\".\n\nHSBC this week cut its forecasts for consumer spending in the UK this year, saying that the real household income squeeze was likely to take a \"sizeable chunk out of consumption over the next couple of years\".\n\nConsumer confidence in Britain was the weakest in the G10 this month (Reuters)\n\nThe EY Item Club said that the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote was \"the key factor\".\n\n\"The UK economy is likely to be buffeted by uncertainty and lack of confidence, with any external risks likely to add to domestic concerns,\" it said.\n\nThe Bank of England, in a widely-praised move, cut its base rate by 0.25pc to 0.25pc on Thursday in a bid to shore up confidence.\n\nBut Mr Archer said that this action had come too late to prevent a worsening of the outlook.\n\nHe said that the governor Mark Carney was \"almost certainly right in the sense that lower interest rates are needed to provide support to confidence, but they are not needed yet\".\n\nSimon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said: \"Looking forward, there are no obvious sources of growth to offset any headwinds.\"\n\nHe said that the recent boost to household spending from lower oil prices was likely to prove short-lived, while business investment and net trade would not make up for the slowdown.\n\nFigures released this week showed that Britain's trade deficit widened in May as exports fell by 2.6pc and imports rose by 3.6pc.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney, has cut interest rates to a record low 0.25pc (Getty Images)\n\n\"Net trade is likely to detract from growth in the quarters ahead, with consumer spending weakening as real incomes come under pressure from the further rise in inflation triggered by the sterling depreciation,\" he said.\n\n\"The greater risk to the near-term outlook is that businesses become so worried about the outlook that they rein in their investment plans, both in terms of equipment and the supply chain.\n\n\"While this is unlikely to happen in the short-term, it would be more likely in the second half of next year if the economic outlook becomes clearer and more negative.\"\n\nMarianne Bauer, chief economist at Berenberg, said that there would be a \"sharp\" economic slowdown as businesses put investment plans on hold.\n\n\"We expect the downturn to be much sharper than previous recessions,\" she said.\n\n\"Uncertainty should keep growth subdued, as will a lack of confidence. For instance, we believe that the weak stock market performance reflects high levels of uncertainty about how the UK's economy will perform in the future.\"<|endoftext|>Young People's Job Corps\n\nThe Young People's Job Corps (Youth Job Corps) is the Department of Labor's (DOL) employment and training program for youth aged 16 through 24 who have not completed high school or obtained a General Educational Development (GED) credential.

"One of the fastest cars to ever leave the drawing board is a supercar from Volkswagen that never made it past the concept stage.\n\nThe Panoz Esperante GT1 concept car, which debuted at the 1999 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, was so outrageously powerful and fast that the U.S. government thought it was in violation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s rules on roadworthiness.\n\nAlthough the NHTSA issued a waiver to Panoz that let the GT1 run on U.S. roads, the supercar was never produced in series form, and all 25 examples that were built have since been retired from road use and retired to collections.\n\nWhy the U.S. government thought a road-legal car that would have a top speed of 208 mph was a safety issue isn’t exactly clear. Although the engine that powered the Panoz was at the heart of a mid-engined sports car that was not street legal, the GT1 had a modified version of the Porsche 911’s 3.2-liter flat-six. The power output was cut from 480 hp to 360 hp for the road-legal GT1.\n\nThat was plenty enough, as the GT1 would have a top speed of 208 mph and a 0-60 time of just 3.3 seconds. But when Panoz released a car that went that fast, the NHTSA reportedly felt it needed to step in. So in 2000, Panoz announced that the car would no longer be street legal, and the entire 25-unit production run was moved to racing, including in the American Le Mans Series.\n\nIt was there that the Esperante GT1 really shined, winning the series’ GT1 class three times from 2000 to 2002. It also won Le Mans in 2001, but it wouldn’t be until 2003 that a GT1 would be driven on American roads again, this time as a Ferrari Enzo-based prototype. That car, the Vitaphone Racing DSR-I, also ran in the American Le Mans Series.\n\nWhen the Ferrari-Panoz racing partnership ended in 2004, the road-legal GT1s were retired, and the cars are now in private collections around the world.\n\nThe Panoz Esperante GT1 may never see the light of day on American roads again, but for car lovers in the U.S., it still holds the record as the fastest car to never have been officially certified by the NHTSA.\n\nSource: Automedia<|endoftext|>Concert Reviews\n\nJUNGLE By ANNIE REILLY WRIGHT EAGLE-TRIBUNE, SEPT. 20, 2003\n\n\n\nSince the band's formation in 1991, Jungle have shown remarkable staying power in the music world. Despite having only one member who was a founding member, the band has endured more than a decade of ups and downs. One constant, however, has remained constant, the ever-changing sound of the band.\n\nIf the band has come off as experimental in the past, with a string of impressive releases that took chances and were often a mixture of rock and hip-hop, \"Mecca\" is even more experimental than anything the band has done to date. Their latest release is the most genre-bending of their career. It is a musical mecca.\n\nThe record opens with the poppy, upbeat \"Ocean of Fantasy.\" The guitar in this song is very prominent, and although the rest of the band is still there, it almost feels like the guitar is the dominant force in the song. The verse also is reminiscent of something from the songbook of The Police. The song has a great, laid back feel and flows effortlessly from beginning to end.\n\nAfter the poppy nature of the opener, \"Fairy Tales\" starts off with a sound reminiscent of punk or hardcore bands, but with an almost pop-like feel. The song changes gears as it progresses, and the energy level picks up significantly. The sound is more raw and straightforward than the previous track. The chorus is probably the most noteworthy part of the song. \"She's in love, she's in love with me/ She loves my eyes, my name, she loves my house\" are the lyrics in the chorus that perfectly portray the point of the song.\n\nThe fourth track, \"Princes,\" has a very Caribbean sound, and the sound is even reflected in the song's name. The sound is unlike anything on the rest of the album. This is the track that really reflects the experimentation of the band. The sound is very unlike anything the band has done, and the vibe is very different than anything in the other songs on the record. The vocals are reminiscent of Jamaican artists, and there is an extremely rhythmic feel to the track.\n\n\"Respect\" is the second song to break the two-minute mark, and it also is the second straight song on the record to sound like a band from the past. The music is hard-hitting, the chorus is fast and catchy, and the sound is very reminiscent of grunge music. The song is definitely a musical journey, and in a very good way.\n\nAnother standout track is \"Mecca.\" The song starts off with a strong bass line that sounds like it could have been ripped right out of a rock-and-roll song of the 1950s or 1960s. The verse has a bit of a throwback sound to it, and the vocals are reminiscent of The Beach Boys. There are a few different musical segments in the song that come together to create a strong, memorable song. \"Cookie Monster\" is the final track on the album, and the vibe of the song is similar to a lot of music from the 1980s. The song is probably the most guitar-driven track on the record, but the band does a good job of putting together a song that is enjoyable. The track is definitely a highlight on the album.\n\nThe album is an excellent addition to Jungle's already impressive career. The band shows on this album that they are still willing to take chances and create a sound that is totally different than anything they have done to date. The album is an eclectic mix of music that is a perfect complement to the band's diverse musical style. The music on the record is fun, upbeat, experimental and shows the musicians in the band are willing to experiment in the studio. The record is a refreshing change of pace for the band, and the songs show that Jungle is ready to move forward and create a sound of their own.\n\nContact AnniemReilly@aol.com\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>On Tuesday, the Texas Supreme Court handed down a decision with great ramifications for public school funding in Texas.\n\nIn the case of Keller Independent School District v. Williams, the Texas Supreme Court unanimously held that the so-called “Robin Hood” school finance system is unconstitutional and is not properly funding public education in Texas.\n\nThe court has held that the current system does not make “available” an “adequate” system of free public schools, the constitutional standard for the financing of public education.\n\nCiting the Legislature’s intent when adopting the “Robin Hood” plan in 1993, the Texas Supreme Court held that the plan was not intended to raise public school funding to adequate levels. The intent of the plan was to remedy the “fund equity” problem, not the problem of inadequate funding. In other words, the “Robin Hood” plan was a tool to distribute the funds to the poorest schools in Texas, not an effort to increase the overall funding for public education.\n\nThe court noted that while a school district may be given more funds for its poor students, it is simultaneously being taken away from other areas of its budget that are not used for poor students.\n\nThe court made the following statements regarding the “Robin Hood” plan:\n\n“If more money for the poor children in one district means less money for other poor children in that district, the same is true for districts that are not identified as having high numbers of poor children. The result is that the children in rich districts such as respondent are funded at higher levels than the children in poorer districts, and there is no evidence that the children in poorer districts are receiving an “adequate education”… The long-established principle is that a State must provide a school system of “substantially equal” educational opportunities to all children within its borders…”\n\nThe court noted that the Legislature, under the “Robin Hood” plan, has failed to “take any meaningful action” to remedy the inadequacies in school funding. Further, the court indicated that the Legislature is not likely to take any significant action to correct the system until it is forced to by a court or the Texas voters.\n\nThe court stated:\n\n“…In addition to the growth in population, the number of school districts, and the number of students in each district, the cost of education has increased. In addition, the Legislature has not provided the level of general revenue funding for public education that has been contemplated. Accordingly, there is a growing need for a new system of school finance. The Legislature must provide the adequate public education required by the Texas Constitution.”\n\nThe court indicated that the Legislature has the authority to establish the amount of public education funding needed in order to provide an “adequate” system of public schools and determine how the system will be funded. The court added that the Legislature “has complete discretion to raise the amount of money needed to provide that funding by whatever means it deems appropriate.”\n\nIn short, it appears that the “Robin Hood” plan, which was adopted by the Legislature in 1993, is now dead.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Legislature"
"First published Thu Jul 16, 2008\n\nThe term ‘atheism’ is used in several distinct, but related, ways. First, atheism may be used to describe the view that there are no deities, that is, no God or gods. Second, atheism may be used to describe the view that belief in deities is false. Third, atheism may be used to describe the view that belief in deities is irrational or without epistemic justification. Finally, atheism may be used to describe the view that the existence of deities is improbable. Each of these distinct usages will be discussed in turn.\n\n1. Defining Atheism\n\nThe English term ‘atheism’ is a neologism. It was coined in the sixteenth century, most likely by one of the followers of Martin Luther. It is derived from the Greek terms ‘a’ (without) and ‘theos’ (god), and was originally intended to mean, quite literally, ‘without gods’. The terms ‘atheist’ and ‘atheism’ were not meant to be pejorative; indeed, they were meant to be descriptively accurate. A person who does not believe in the existence of deities is properly called an atheist.\n\nAlthough the term ‘atheist’ was first coined in the sixteenth century, there were atheistic views expressed well before that time. The ancient Greek philosophers Epicurus (341–270 BCE) and Diagoras of Melos (5th century BCE) were probably the first Western thinkers to express atheistic views. Later, the Roman philosopher Sextus Empiricus (160–210 CE) characterized atheism as the claim that the existence of deities is unsupported by reason. And during the European Renaissance and Enlightenment, various thinkers—most notably, Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677)—espoused fully developed, sophisticated atheistic world-views.\n\nThe primary focus of this entry is contemporary Western atheism. There are, however, two pre-theistic Western thinkers who are of particular importance to the contemporary study of atheism. The first is Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE), the preeminent figure in Western philosophy. Although Socrates never explicitly states that he does not believe in gods, he offers a number of arguments that can be construed as atheistic. For instance, in Plato's Euthyphro, Socrates asks Euthyphro to provide a definition of ‘holiness’. After three failed attempts, Euthyphro concludes that holiness is what is loved by the gods. Socrates points out that this is circular reasoning, for the proposition that the gods love what is holy is merely another way of saying that the gods love what is holy. But this, says Socrates, is tantamount to the claim that the gods love what is holy because the gods love what is holy. And this is clearly a vicious circle. Thus, Euthyphro has failed to provide a definition of ‘holiness’, and has also failed to provide a justification for theistic belief. Similar arguments may be found in Plato's Theaetetus, Sophist, and Republic. In the Theaetetus, Socrates gives a number of arguments to show that, if the demiurge did create the world, then he must have used a model. But the existence of a model is incompatible with the definition of a creator, which is that a creator must be the original and have no model. Therefore, if the demiurge exists, then he cannot be a creator. In the Sophist, Socrates discusses the problem of false judgments. His discussion centers on the thesis that if something appears F, but is not F, then it is not the case that it appears F. It turns out that it is impossible to know what appears F but is not F. Therefore, according to Socrates, it is impossible to make false judgments. But this is absurd, for all judgments are either true or false. Therefore, all judgments are either known or not known. But it is not the case that all judgments are either known or not known. Therefore, the thesis that all judgments are either known or not known is false. This argument can be construed as an attack on the coherence of theistic belief. Finally, in Plato's Republic, Socrates uses an argument that is now known as ‘Socrates’ dream’ to show that the philosopher is the only sort of person fit to rule in a just society. His argument turns on the claim that when we are asleep we are able to imagine things. But we are not aware of imagining things. Therefore, when we are asleep we do not know that we are imagining things. Thus, according to Socrates, we are not aware of imagining things when we are awake either. Therefore, we are not aware of imagining things now. But if we are not aware of imagining things now, then we are not aware of existing now. But we are aware of existing now. Therefore, we are not imagining things now. But if we are not imagining things now, then we are not dreaming. But we are dreaming. Therefore, we are not dreaming now. But we are dreaming now. Therefore, the thesis that we are dreaming now is false. The conclusion of this argument is that the philosopher is the only sort of person fit to rule in a just society. One of the most important points of this argument is that it must be the case that we are aware of existing now, even when we are dreaming. This point is crucial to the argument because it means that when we dream we do not have the experience of existing now. But if we are not having the experience of existing now, then we are not dreaming. Thus, the thesis that we are dreaming now is false. In his examination of dreams, Socrates suggests that there are four different ways of ‘being’. These are the ways of being awake, asleep, dreaming, and being dead. It turns out that only the being awake and the being dead ways of ‘being’ are truly ‘being’. The being asleep and the being dead ways of ‘being’ are not ‘being’. Thus, the beings asleep and the beings dead ways of ‘being’ are not the same way of ‘being’ as the beings awake and the being dead ways of ‘being’. But if the beings asleep and the beings dead ways of ‘being’ are not the same way of ‘being’ as the beings awake and the being dead ways of ‘being’, then the beings asleep and the beings dead ways of ‘being’ are not truly ‘being’. Therefore, the beings asleep and the beings dead ways of ‘being’ are not truly ‘being’. The conclusion of this argument is that only the being awake and being dead ways of ‘being’ are truly ‘being’. This is a crucial point, for it is clear that we are having the experience of being awake, but not the experience of being asleep or being dead. Therefore, it is impossible that we are truly ‘being’ asleep or truly ‘being’ dead. But if we are not truly ‘being’ asleep or truly ‘being’ dead, then it is impossible for us to be truly ‘being’ these things. Therefore, it is impossible for us to be truly ‘being’ things that do not exist, like the demiurge or the Forms. The conclusion of this argument is that there are no demiurgic beings or Forms.\n\nThe second pre-theistic Western thinker of particular importance to the contemporary study of atheism is Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677). Spinoza was raised in a Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam, and later studied Euclid, Descartes, and Latin classics at a Collegiant Academy. In 1656, he published a short treatise on the correct interpretation of Scripture, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, anonymously. Spinoza was banished from the Jewish community of Amsterdam for the content of this work, and later went into hiding. He was re-discovered in 1661, and was offered the choice between retracting his claims and being banished or going into exile voluntarily. He chose to go into exile voluntarily, and spent the last four years of his life in the German town of Rijnsburg, where he wrote most of his important works.\n\nSpinoza rejected the immortality of the soul, the existence of angels and demons, the notion that God stands in a special relationship with Jews, and the view that God performs miracles in the world. He also rejected the view that the content of Scripture is dictated by God, saying instead that Scripture must be interpreted in the same manner as any other book. Although the label ‘atheist’ is not often applied to Spinoza, the content of his thought is largely consistent with what contemporary philosophers mean by ‘atheism’.\n\nThere are many varieties of atheism, and a correspondingly large number of definitions of the term. Here, I will limit my discussion to those definitions that are most widely accepted by contemporary philosophers. In addition, I will adopt a broadly deflationary conception of atheism, on which atheism is not a substantive philosophical position, but merely a denial of theistic belief. On this conception, an atheist is someone who does not believe in the existence of any deities, not someone who positively believes that no deities exist.\n\nLet us begin by considering the definitional project. Is there a clear and uncontroversial definition of atheism that can be agreed upon by all philosophers? In his extensive discussions of atheism, Schellenberg (2000) argues that there is not. And according to Schellenberg, this lack of agreement is not merely the result of academic"
"Boswellia\n\nBoswellia is a genus of trees in the frankincense (also known as olibanum or gum olibanum) subfamily of the family Burseraceae. The genus comprises five species, four native to Africa, and one native to India. The Frankincense tree (also known as the Olibanum tree) is a common depiction in ancient Middle Eastern civilizations, and is today named for the medieval merchant Frankincense traders. The gum resin it produces was popular as a resin in the ancient world, and is still used as incense and perfume. \"Boswellia\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the common swift.\n\n\"Boswellia\" species grow into large trees, reaching tall. Their leaves are pinnate, long. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in dense clusters. The fruits are roughly spherical, and long. All species of \"Boswellia\" bear a gum resin, or oleo-gum-resin, that is golden in colour. This resin is the raw material from which the ancient Egyptians carved their prized \"Boswellia sacra\" incense, and which has been traded and used for centuries.\n\nThe Boswellia species are divided into four sections:\n\nIn addition, \"B. frereana\" is sometimes also placed in \"Boswellia\", and \"B. papyrifera\" is a sister to all other \"Boswellia\" species.\n\nThe gum resin of \"B. sacra\" has been used as incense in Ancient Egypt and the Near East for thousands of years. It is burned as an incense in Arab and Indian prayer ceremonies, and is used in the purification rites of Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. It is used to treat leprosy in Ethiopian folk medicine, and has been used as an incense in Somalia and the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThe name frankincense (commonly used to refer to \"B. sacra\") comes from Old French \"franc encens\", meaning \"pure incense\". In turn, that may come from Latin \"francus\", meaning \"pure\" or \"freeborn\".\n\n\"Boswellia sacra\" is a tree that grows up to 20 m tall with thick, yellowish to pale brown bark. \"Boswellia sacra\" is primarily native to northeastern Africa, growing in Somalia, eastern Sudan, Djibouti, northern Eritrea, eastern Ethiopia, and eastern and southern Kenya. It is also thought to be native in southern Arabia. Its presence in Socotra, an island off the coast of Yemen, is uncertain.\n\n\"Boswellia papyrifera\" grows in Somalia, southern Arabia, and India, as well as eastward to Pakistan. It is also known as the \"Indian olibanum tree\". It is thought to be the largest producer of olibanum resin in the world, with typical trees producing 30 to 40 kg per year. It is closely related to \"Boswellia serrata\" and \"Boswellia carteri\".\n\n\"Boswellia serrata\" is an evergreen tree native to India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and possibly Nepal. It grows up to 20 m tall, with a crown of large, spreading branches. Its leaves are pinnate, long, with 20 to 25 pairs of leaflets, each up to long. The flowers are greenish-white, arranged in dense inflorescences. The fruits are spherical, and long. It is closely related to \"B. papyrifera\".\n\n\"Boswellia carteri\" is an evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula, the Horn of Africa, and Socotra. It grows up to 20 m tall, with a crown of large, spreading branches. Its leaves are pinnate, long, with 20 to 25 pairs of leaflets, each up to long. The flowers are greenish-white, arranged in dense inflorescences. The fruits are spherical, and long. It is closely related to \"B. papyrifera\".\n\n\"Boswellia frereana\" is an evergreen tree native to Somalia. It grows up to 15 m tall, with a crown of large, spreading branches. Its leaves are pinnate, long, with 20 to 25 pairs of leaflets, each up to long. The flowers are greenish-white, arranged in dense inflorescences. The fruits are spherical, and long.\n\n\"Boswellia\" resin has been found in the eastern Mediterranean region dating back to the Neolithic age.\n\nFrankincense is mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible, which states that the Israelites were using it in the Temple as early as the 15th century BCE.\n\nIn the Second Book of Kings (), the prophet Elijah challenges the priests of Baal to demonstrate their worship. They place an offering on a shrine, and invoke the name of Baal from morning to noon, but there is no response. At noon Elijah begins to taunt them, and \"they have sacrificed to the noise of the harpists and to the noise of the trumpeters\". When Elijah has finished speaking, \"the Lord answered him\", a great wind comes up, and Elijah's mantle, a part of his prophetic outfit, is torn into twelve pieces. He sends a message to his servant saying, \"Go up and look towards the sea\", and \"behold, there came a cloud and wind, and parted the two, and there was a great and strong wind, that divided the sea, and blew down the wall, and it fell\".\n\nThe first thing he then tells his servant to do is to \"gather together\" twelve large stones and then set up an altar of cut stone. The altar is used to sacrifice the bullock and the ram that were offered by King Ahab to replace the divine response that Elijah had just defeated. Elijah then pours water over the offering, and the sacrifice is pleasing to God, but the water also finds its way into the jar of oil kept at the temple. At that point, the story jumps to what happens next. The passage continues, stating that the next morning, the priests of Baal say that they will offer their sacrifices on the rising of the sun, but Elijah replies that they should pray first and test God. The altar is destroyed, and Elijah gathers the people to him, praying that rain will come.\n\nThen he sets out once more, but his departure is delayed by an encounter with a company of prophets of the Ba'al, and then a great and heavy rain, as he walks up the hill. The story is usually taken to symbolize the victory of monotheism over paganism, with the prayers of Elijah being the turning point.\n\nArchaeologists have found much evidence of the use of \"Boswellia sacra\" resin in ancient Egypt, dating back to as early as the Second Dynasty. In a tomb in Saqqara, a cylinder seal from the late Fourth Dynasty shows a sacral tree. The ancient Egyptians used the resin of the tree to create a resin cement, and combined it with plaster to make their ready-mixed plaster for walls and papyri. They used it as an ingredient in incense, and as a fragrance. In the Amduat, the god Osiris is said to \"make fragrant the per-nu\" (the house of the night), and the Book of the Dead refers to the \"trees of frankincense\" more than 40 times. In the tomb of Ramesses II, he is shown \"walking in the midst of the trees of frankincense\". At the Temple of Amun in Karnak, there were six \"trees of frankincense\", three on either side of the entrance. A wall in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera depicts men gathering the sap of the trees.\n\nThe Assyrians used frankincense in their temples, believing that it would give them the divine wisdom they craved. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the tears of the great king are used to make a libation. In ancient China, people used incense made from frankincense in their ceremonies.\n\nAmong the Parthians, the odor of frankincense was a sign of mourning, and they would burn it at funerals. In ancient Greece, the words for \"frankincense\" and \"purity\" were the same: \"eleos\". Plutarch stated that the best frankincense came from Asia Minor, and was taken from a tree that could be found there. The Phoenicians would spread the word of the best sources of frankincense, and it was exported to the rest of the Mediterranean from there. The Greek botanist Theophrastus states that frankincense comes from Arabia, and it is one of the earliest Arabian products to be mentioned in Europe. Dioscorides described several species, and stated that their resin was produced on the Arabian peninsula.\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, there were several notable incense routes. The trade in frankincense and myrrh accounted for a large part of Roman trade. The route ran from the eastern end of the Mediterranean sea to Gaza, then across the Sinai to Berenice, then across the desert to Leptis Magna, Tripolis, and Lixus, then finally to the west coast of Morocco, where the Berbers still hold the tradition of burning frankincense to honor the dead.\n\nThe ancient Egyptian word for frankincense was \"sheneb\", which was part of an elaborate terminology used by ancient Egyptian priests to describe the various ingredients in incense.\n\nA wide range of substances were used for inc"

Artemis comes up with a different solution, but it isn’t long before Holly Short and the rest of the police arrive. They get a lead that the man who’s selling the stolen technology will be in a certain bar that night, so they all go to stake it out. But something goes wrong when they go in and a mysterious man shows up, knocking Holly out. Artemis realizes he is not dealing with an ordinary gangster. Artemis wants to help Holly and will go to any lengths to do so. But he must also finish his deal with the seller in order to save his family from a horrible fate.\n\nLike all of Eoin Colfer’s books, it is an interesting read and a page turner.

These elements are essential for healthy plants and fruit.\n\nAccording to Hartman, nutrients in the soil should be available when the plants need them to achieve maximum production. “We also know from research that when we deliver these nutrients at a critical time, we’re going to get more berries and bigger berries,” Hartman told the MSGA.\n\nHe suggests that growers start adding Nutristart 10-6-26, a commercially formulated product that contains phosphates and potassium, to the crop when the temperature goes above 40 degrees F and the pH is 5.3 or lower.\n\nGrowers should begin by applying 1 to 1.5 pounds of Nutristart 10-6-26 per 100 square feet of bed, depending on the type of growing media, says Hartman.\n\nFor crops that don’t have a high pH at planting, such as flats or bare-root, growers should add Nutristart 10-6-26 as the plants start to grow and root.\n\n“You don’t want to add the Nutristart 10-6-26 to the soil at this time because it might be too much,” Hartman says. “You should add this when the pH of the bed is already down around 5.3 or lower, and when the plants are already growing.”\n\nThe Nutristart 10-6-26 product can be mixed with the soil and can be applied through overhead sprinklers or applied with a hand sprayer or dust applicator, he says.\n\nWhen making soil tests, growers should take several soil samples from several different parts of their crop to determine how the soil is behaving and to make sure that the same type of fertilizer is being applied throughout the crop.\n\nHartman says that growers can also use a soil probe or a soil auger to obtain a core of soil for testing. He says that a sampling of 4 inches down, or deeper, should be sufficient to test the soil’s pH.\n\n“If the plants are green, and you have a good root system, that’s an indication that the soil is in good shape,” Hartman says.\n\nThe Nutristart 10-6-26 product is available from local distributors. Hartman cautions that it is a chelated product, so it shouldn’t be applied during the heat of the day when it can be lost due to volatilization.\n\n“When you buy any kind of soil additive, especially chelated products, you need to be careful about application time,” Hartman says. “You can lose a good chunk of those chelated products if you apply them at the wrong time of day.”\n\nHartman’s presentation was part of the MSGA’s annual Spring Meeting at the University of Maine.\n\nHatch first started growing organic strawberries in his Leyden greenhouse in 1998. His interest in the challenges of organic growing started when he was just 5 years old, when his father first started growing strawberries commercially in western Massachusetts.\n\nDuring the past five years, Hatch has applied for and received a number of organic certifications for his greenhouses, including Organic Certification by the USDA and Organic Certification by the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association.\n\nFor more information about Hatch’s organic greenhouses, contact Hatch’s Organic at 693-5111 or visit www.hatchso.com.<|endoftext|>And on the flip side…\n\nSix men have come forward alleging sex abuse at the hands of Republican Donald Trump in an exclusive report from The Daily Beast.\n\nAccording to the report, four men who spoke to The Daily Beast said that Trump had walked in on them changing while they were teen beauty pageant contestants. Two of the men said Trump had groped them.\n\nThree of the men have not spoken to the press before. The fourth, who now lives in the Chicago area, agreed to speak on the record. The fifth man’s allegations have been made to other media outlets, but he agreed to speak on the record to The Daily Beast.\n\n“This was ‘Trumped!’ in the New York media market,” said Harry Waisbren, an owner of the agency representing some of the accusers, who previously worked as an executive for the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants.\n\nTwo of the men also said that Trump had walked into the dressing room while contestants were naked. The third accuser said Trump had watched him changing through a doorway.\n\n“I remember putting on my suit really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’” said Mariah Billado, who represented Vermont in the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant. “Donald Trump just walks right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.”\n\n“He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything,” she said. “Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.”\n\nBillado added that Trump did not offer her or other women any money after he intruded on them.\n\nThe other three accusers did not provide their names to The Daily Beast. They said that Trump had come into the dressing room while girls were changing, including when the contestants were nude. Two of them added that Trump had groped them.\n\n“I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’” said the former Miss Washington. “He was like, ‘Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before.’”\n\nThe woman said Trump had initially entered the dressing room while the contestants were “half naked” and speculated that he “sort of knew” the contestants would be naked at that point.\n\n“The time that he walked through the dressing rooms was really shocking. We were all naked,” she said. “He was probably one of the most ashamed people to walk through that dressing room.”\n\nA fourth woman, who also did not provide her name, said that Trump had walked into the dressing room of contestants in their underwear.\n\nThe contestant said that Trump had first come into the dressing room while they were wearing robes and many contestants were topless.\n\n“I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’” she told The Daily Beast. “He was like, ‘Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before.’”\n\nAccording to the contestant, Trump had come back in and walked “right in front” of her and other contestants as they were changing into their costumes.\n\n“He was basically saying, ‘These are beautiful women and I can do anything I want,’” she said. “‘You can get naked and do anything.’”\n\n“He was maybe 7 feet away from me,” she added. “So I could physically see him, and he was looking right at me.”\n\nWhen asked what he did while in the dressing room, the woman said, “He was just staring, it was definitely a weird moment.”\n\nThe woman, who was 18 at the time, was not only upset by Trump’s presence in the room but also by how he had described the contestants to her and other contestants.\n\n“He started saying to us, ‘Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before. I’ve done all of this,’” the woman said. “I was in a state of shock.”\n\nTwo other Miss Teen USA contestants, who"

Perché la lotta al terribile virus è divenuta quasi la priorità assoluta.\n\nMa all’origine, quando tutto era ancora nella sua fase di incubazione, fu lo sfruttamento, la schiavitù, il colonialismo e l’impoverimento di un continente di rara bellezza e di straordinaria ricchezza.\n\nUn continente che può vantare la presenza di ricchissime riserve d’oro e d’argento, di petrolio, di gas naturale, di diamanti, di acque salate, di pozzi petroliferi, di giacimenti d’oltremare.\n\nUn continente che vanta il ricchissimo patrimonio della sua storia, quando i suoi popoli vivevano a contatto con i più importanti imperi di storia umana, dall’Impero romano, all’Impero Ottomano, dall’Impero britannico, all’Impero coloniale francese.\n\nUn continente che può vantare un patrimonio archeologico straordinario, con antiche rovine che testimoniano di storia millenaria.\n\nUn continente che ha da sempre la sua priorità: la lotta al terribile virus, il tasso di mortalità è incredibile, con decine di migliaia di morti.\n\nCiò ha una ricaduta nella politica, e viene confermato dai dati delle banche centrali che, ad esempio, sottolineano il declino del Pil dell’Africa nel 2012, segnando un calo dell’1,9% rispetto all’anno precedente.\n\nSi tratta di uno scenario preoccupante, soprattutto perché la mortalità di massa, soprattutto tra i bambini, ha già generato un forte impatto sulle economie degli Stati, e può avere una ripercussione non indifferente sull’economia globale.\n\nEd è proprio questo il punto, una volta scomparsi da questo mondo i giovani di una certa età, l’economia degli Stati si fermerà di fatto, perché quella che viene definita “forza lavoro” è ridotta, e vi saranno ben poche persone ancora in grado di lavorare, tanto meno nel caso di malattie infettive, a meno che non si pensi a mezzi artificiali per mantenere in vita i malati, ma senza poter essere operativi.\n\nUna volta esaurite le risorse, i paesi si ritroveranno a fare i conti con un futuro incerto, un futuro con uno scenario poco roseo, e solo dopo aver affrontato la questione delle risorse naturali si potrà affrontare la questione di come curare il virus, una questione che però è alquanto complicata.\n\nUna volta completata l’operazione controllo delle risorse, l’umanità dovrà fare i conti con un’epidemia che può avere una ricaduta anche sul mondo industriale, quello della manifattura e delle industrie manifatturiere.\n\nIl risultato sarà che, senza le risorse necessarie, e soprattutto in assenza dei giovani, la produzione diminuirà, con una ulteriore svalutazione delle attività economiche.\n\nL’impoverimento dell’Africa e l’impoverimento dell’umanità sono due aspetti interconnessi, e bisogna fare i conti con entrambi.\n\nBisogna quindi farci i conti, e, di conseguenza, bisogna prendere delle decisioni anche rispetto a un piano che, per quanto inadeguato, potrebbe essere la base di partenza per il futuro, un futuro che deve essere, prima o poi, deciso dall’umanità stessa.<|endoftext|>Thank you to everyone who joined us at SXSW to see great artists including Flume, BADBADNOTGOOD, Weezer, Matt & Kim, Cold War Kids, St. Lucia, Neon Trees, and FIDLAR.\n\nWe are very grateful for your help with the SXSW Artist Lounge and look forward to returning next year.\n\nKeep following our Facebook page for updates on next year's SXSW!\n\nCheck out the lounge wall photos below, and stay up-to-date on Twitter with the hashtag #SXSWArtistLounge.<|endoftext|>Otso Saarisen elämäkertaa kirjoittanut Anu Saari kertoo, että Otso Saarisen syntymäpäivä on vietetty perinteisesti vappuaattona.

It covers a range of applications, from astronomy to economics, from chemistry to earth science.\n\nEach branch of computer science has its own internal history and its own research community, but it's possible to make sense of them all. This book brings them all together, and tells the story of how the tools we use today have evolved over the past six decades.\n\nThe book uses two cases studies to illustrate the benefits and the challenges of the interplay between computer science and science. The first is the evolution of computational physics.\n\nThe second is the evolution of computational astronomy.\n\nThroughout the book, the focus is on explaining the impact of these tools on science.\n\nEarly computer science was limited by the capabilities of the computers that existed in the 1960s and 1970s. Those computers lacked the resources to solve complex problems that were more than a few orders of magnitude above the size of those computers. The book begins with a detailed exploration of the problems we faced as computer scientists, and the solutions we developed. It concludes by looking at the technological advances that have created the current computing landscape. Along the way, we will explain the basics of computational science, and show how computing tools are a central part of modern scientific practice.<|endoftext|>Andy Cohen\n\nIn 2011, Cohen made his debut as the host of the Bravo reality television series \"Watch What Happens Live\", a live, late-night show in which he talks about pop culture, celebrity gossip and his own personal life, which he had previously done as host of \"The Real Housewives After Show\".

I know that for me it has been difficult to not only reach out to people but to let people in. I have always been an introvert, with a heart for serving, but for a long time I didn't understand the world around me. It seemed like everyone around me was doing the things that they were called to do, and I wasn't. The loneliness would at times seem unbearable. But what I have learned over the past few years is that we are all called to serve, and what feels like our personal inadequacy can actually be the way in which God is working in and through us. In his word, we are shown stories of men who were not special in any way, but were used by God in ways that have impacted the lives of generations. God can and will use us, and while we may not see what we are doing as worthwhile, He does. He uses each of us in our own unique way to bring his kingdom to earth. This Christmas season, open your eyes to the way that God is working in and through you.

The gesture, a tribute to Bradley's late father, didn't go unnoticed.\n\nBradley's teammates and coaches quickly joined him, forming a circle of support as the players and fans chanted \"Matt, Matt, Matt\" together.\n\n\"It was an emotional game, and I think the emotions just took over,\" Bradley said. \"I didn't expect it to be that loud. I was very surprised by that. They were there for me.\"\n\nJust days after his father passed away, Bradley gave his best performance of the season, scoring a career-high 22 points and hitting five three-pointers.\n\n\"Matt was amazing,\" head coach Bob Williams said. \"I know he's going through a tough time and you really never know how kids are going to handle things like that. It takes a special person to go out and play like he did. I'm just proud of him.\"\n\nA day earlier, the 20-year-old junior spent his first Christmas without his father, Rod Bradley.\n\nBradley lost his father to cancer after a year-long battle with the disease. A professor in the History and Anthropology Department at UCSB, Bradley was known for his easy-going demeanor and his deep love of basketball.\n\n\"I'd just like to thank all of the fans for their support during the game,\" Bradley said. \"That helped a lot.\"\n\nBradley came out hot, making his first four three-point attempts, two of which came on back-to-back possessions as the game got underway.\n\n\"Matt's a tough kid and he wanted to play,\" Williams said. \"It was the first time he's had to deal with anything like this and it was pretty difficult for him.\"\n\nHe'd go on to finish the game with a career-high nine field goals and two free throws, while connecting on five of his 10 attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nIt was more than the numbers that stood out, though.\n\nIn his best showing of the season, Bradley came up with big plays when they were needed most.\n\nIn the second half, the two-time All-Big West first-team selection scored six of UCSB's first eight points.\n\nAnd on the final possession of the game, Bradley took a pass from fellow senior LaBradford Franklin, received a screen from freshman Jake Lees and hit a jumper in the lane with 22 seconds remaining to seal the win.\n\n\"I just told him to keep shooting,\" Franklin said. \"He stepped up and did a good job. That's what we expect from Matt. He's an experienced player and he's a smart player.\"\n\nWilliams praised the senior for playing through the emotions of the week and said that, in the end, Bradley's efforts and dedication to the game made all the difference.\n\n\"I told him before the game that he needed to come out and have a good game for his dad,\" Williams said. \"He stepped up and he did it for his dad.\"\n\nIn addition to Bradley, who was named the the Big West Player of the Week for the second consecutive week on Monday, three other players earned honors.\n\nFranklin was named the Big West Freshman of the Week and was also tabbed the league's Rookie of the Week on Monday.\n\nAlso named the Big West Freshman of the Week was freshman forward Winston Shepard. Shepard averaged 14.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists over a pair of wins last week.\n\nUCSB returns to action when they host Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday at 8:00 p.m.<|endoftext|>Thats the design to do, that not everybody does it.

What is the pattern of Christian prayer?\" You will find yourself in a completely different framework. The pattern of prayer is like this. Jesus taught us to begin with the Father in heaven. \"Our Father, who art in heaven...\" Jesus taught us to say to God the Father: \"Our Father, who art in heaven...\"\n\nNow what does this mean? What does it mean to begin with God in heaven? Does it mean to begin by asking God to send his son to come down from heaven? Does it mean to ask God to help the Holy Spirit to come down from heaven? Does it mean to ask God to make your heavenly Father to send his Son down from heaven? No. All these things we can and do ask for, but what is the point of beginning by asking God to send his Son and the Holy Spirit down from heaven? To begin with God in heaven means to begin with God, the source of all things. It means to begin with the origin, the fountain-head, the creator, the Father of the Son and the Holy Spirit. To begin with God in heaven means to begin with the source of the creation, the source of all things. To begin with God in heaven means to begin with the creator, the source of all things.\n\nIf God is the creator, what then? Then what is the pattern of Christian prayer? \"Our Father, who art in heaven... thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\"\n\nSo there are two things: there is the pattern of creation and there is the pattern of will.\n\nThe pattern of creation is, that God said: \"Let there be light.\" And there was light. That was the pattern of creation. That is the pattern of God's creative will.\n\nThe pattern of God's will is this: He said, \"Let there be light...\" He willed it, it was so. Then he said, \"Let there be man in my image and likeness.\" He willed it, it was so. He said, \"Let there be a son in my image and likeness.\" He willed it, it was so. He said, \"Let there be a Spirit in my image and likeness.\" He willed it, it was so. The pattern of God's will is this: He said, \"Let it be so,\" and it was so. He willed it and it was so.\n\nThen what? When you say to God: \"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,\" you say that in the will of God there is already light, there is already man in God's image, there is already a son in God's image, there is already the Holy Spirit in God's image. That means that you are already illumined, already in God's image, already a son in God's image, already illuminated with the Holy Spirit in God's image. When you say, \"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,\" you say that in God's will you already are illumined, you are already in God's image, you are already a son in God's image, you are already illuminated with the Holy Spirit in God's image. You say, \"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" You say that in God's will you already are in God's image, you already are illumined, you already are a son in God's image, you already are illuminated with the Holy Spirit in God's image.\n\nThe pattern of creation is, that God said: \"Let there be light.\" And there was light. The pattern of will is this: He said, \"Let it be so,\" and it was so.\n\nThen what?\n\nThen what do you do? Then you say to God, \"Father, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" When you say, \"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,\" you say that you are already in God's image, already illumined, already a son in God's image, already illuminated with the Holy Spirit in God's image. You say that you already are in God's image, you already are illumined, you already are a son in God's image, you already are illuminated with the Holy Spirit in God's image. Then what? When you say, \"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,\" you say, \"Father, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" In other words, you say to God, \"I accept Thy will, as it is in heaven.\"\n\nIf you say to God, \"I accept Thy will, as it is in heaven,\" then you do this: you say to God, \"Father, I want to accept Thy will, as it is in heaven. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" You want to be illumined, you want to be in God's image, you want to be a son in God's image, you want to be illuminated with the Holy Spirit in God's image. That means, you say to God: \"I want to accept Thy will, as it is in heaven.\"\n\nYou say, \"Father, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\" Then what? Then you say to God, \"Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.\" You say to God, \"Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.\" You say to God, \"Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.\"\n\nNow what does this mean? This means that you say to God, \"Father, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.\" You say to God, \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\" What does this mean? This means that in earth your will should be done in the same way as in heaven. This means that on earth your will should be done in the same way as in heaven. This means that on earth your will should be done in the same way as in heaven. What does this mean? This means that on earth your will should be done in the same way as in heaven.\n\nThen what? Then you say to God, \"Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.\" Then you say to God, \"Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.\" Then you say to God, \"Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.\" Then you say to God,"
"While both accounts are true, the explanations you have given are incomplete. The Washington Times, in an article entitled \"3 million \"dead voters\"\", puts the blame on the infamous book \"Subversion of the United States Government\", by Dr. Cleon Skousen. The book outlines the plan to subvert our government and outlines the three types of Communists, Cultural, Economic, and Military. This article also states that it is not only this book, but also three others: The Naked Communist, The Naked Capitalist, and The Naked Communist Goal for a World Government. These books were all written by Dr. Cleon Skousen. These four books are available at www.lrc-online.org/lrc-library/books.htm I highly recommend reading these books and analyzing the evidence.

Det er klart det er en belastning for alle, men vi gjør det fordi vi vil vise at vi tror på det, sier unggutten.\n\nHan mener at det er helt feil å si at datteren ble hentet ut av bordellet mot sin vilje.\n\n- Jeg tror det er litt overdrevet. Jeg tror det er slik det var. Jeg tror ikke noe annet, sier Torp.\n\nHar tro på datteren\n\nTorp har et ekstremt følelsesmessig forhold til datteren.\n\n- Hun har alltid vært en trofast liten pike. Jeg kan forstå at hun kan ha gjort dette, sier 17-åringen.\n\nForeldrene fikk hjelp av Redd Barna til å finne datteren. De tok med seg bilder av datteren til den danske ambassaden.\n\nRedd Barna har ikke tidligere opplevd en slik sak.\n\n- Men vi håper jo at dette bare er en engangshendelse, sier kommunikasjonsrådgiver i Redd Barna i Norge, Vibeke Leithe Høst.\n\n- Tror ikke hun tjente penger\n\nTorp har tro på datteren sin.\n\n- Jeg tror hun har jobbet med oppvask eller stell. Jeg tror hun har tjent penger på det, sier Torp.\n\nVibeke Leithe Høst i Redd Barna sier det er sannsynlig at den danske jenta har blitt presset til å tjene penger.\n\n- De har blitt tvunget til å selge sex for å tjene penger. Så lenge det er lite penger, tror vi at de har blitt tvunget til å jobbe for en annen.\n\n- Jeg har fortalt Torp at jeg tror det er grunnen til at datteren er i Danmark, sier Høst.\n\n- Det har ikke kommet noe oppvask eller stell fordi datteren har måttet selge seg, sier hun.\n\nTorp tror ikke at datteren tjente penger.\n\n- Jeg har ikke sett noe på banken. Jeg tror ikke hun har tjent noen penger, sier han.\n\nDatteren nekter for prostitusjon\n\nDatteren sier hun ikke tjente penger på å selge sex.\n\n- Jeg kan bekrefte at jeg har hatt sex med to menn, men det er ikke snakk om prostitusjon, sier hun til TV2.\n\n17-åringen har vært i Danmark i tre måneder. Nå har hun hatt det bra hos familien.\n\nTorp forteller at han er takknemlig for støtten de får fra familien i Danmark.\n\n- Jeg er veldig takknemlig for det, sier han.\n\nGlad for at datteren er hjemme\n\nTorp er glad for at datteren er hjemme i Norge.\n\n- Jeg er kjempefornøyd, og veldig takknemlig.

"I don't understand what it is that you want to achieve here, I guess. I'm looking at the code that you've written, it seems to be a valid expression. Your first program seems to work. And, it does indeed take less time than your second program. So, I'm wondering what it is you are trying to achieve here, with these two different approaches. It seems like you're doing exactly what you should be doing, from a coding perspective, in each case. If it takes less time to execute a valid expression than an invalid one, it's because of the way that the evaluator works. And, it will take exactly the same amount of time for each execution, since the time is due to the very expression you are evaluating. If it were more expensive to evaluate one expression than the other, then you would not get exactly the same execution time for each execution of the program, but the one that you have written seems to be producing the same execution time for each execution.\n\nLooking at the times returned by the timing subroutine, I think it's time to read your first post carefully again, because the results you are getting with the timing subroutine seem to be a bit surprising. For example, your first program is using a compiled version of your code, since you compile it with -c . But, you have your test cases written as though you were executing the code directly, without any pre-compilation. You get a total execution time of about 2 seconds, and then you call the timing subroutine, and you get the following times for the code that you have written:\n\n(load (compile 'sample)) -> 0.004119s\n\n(load (compile 'valid)) -> 0.003774s\n\n(load (compile 'invalid)) -> 0.003771s\n\n(time (load (compile 'valid))) -> 0.003794s\n\n(time (load (compile 'invalid))) -> 0.003784s\n\n(time (load (compile 'sample))) -> 0.004119s\n\nI'm not saying that this is wrong, but it's certainly not what I would have expected. You say that it takes about 2 seconds to evaluate your code without pre-compiling, and then about 0.1 seconds to execute the compiled version. But, you are timing your un-compiled code to be taking about the same amount of time as your compiled code. I'm trying to understand the sequence of events, from your first post:\n\nEvaluate the code in my head -> ~2s\n\nType the code into the file -> ~2s\n\nCompile the file -> ~0.1s\n\nI guess I would expect that pre-compiling the code would take less time than evaluating it in my head, and I guess I would also expect that the evaluation time for your compiled code would be a lot less than the evaluation time for the un-compiled code. And, if the evaluation time is pretty much the same, then I would expect the pre-compile time to be significantly less than the pre-compile time for the code that you are timing.\n\nI'm just having a difficult time understanding how this is all working, from a code perspective.\n\nI'm just hoping you will explain what you are trying to do. Why do you think that the second version is \"easier to read\"? Why do you think that it is \"easier to debug\"? Is there a reason why you need to run both versions? I don't see how the compiler could make your code any easier to debug, for example.\n\nI'm sorry if I'm not making sense. I'm still trying to figure out exactly what you are doing here, and how you are trying to accomplish it.<|endoftext|>Hoppas du har en bra dag! Jag har ju lovat en sån här grej sedan länge så här kommer den:\n\nEfter att ha spelat WOW i några år så ville jag göra något mer nytt. Började söka efter alternativa spel och där hittade jag Age of Conan.\n\nJag började först spela som Priest men efter kanske 20 timmar så ville jag göra något nytt. Funderade ett tag och föll då på hur det skulle vara att spela som hjälte.\n\nJag måste tillägga att jag var lite osäker på vad en hjälte gör, om han har lite ”nördiga” spec som att snabbast byta mellan skjutvapen, jag kände mig lite osäker på hur det skulle vara men föll ändå på att bli Ranger.\n\nOch jag kunde inte vara gladare över det! Jag älskar just att det inte finns några spec utan alla tre skjutvapen är lika bra. Att det går snabbt att byta mellan skjutvapen och att alla tre har skjutvapen som bra skjutvapen. Jag är så glad över valet!\n\nAtt Ranger är som han är ser jag verkligen fram emot. Att spela som Ranger kommer bli riktigt mysigt och en hel del roligt att göra.\n\nEfter att jag själv spelat en del och såg på lite videor på Ranger så har jag bestämt mig för att det kommer vara fullt på aktiviteterna. Det finns så mycket att göra. Jag kommer kunna leka lite på projektet där man bygger om landskapet medan jag spelar, jag kommer kunna leka att hämnas offrens, leka att övertala spelare att vara med i projektet. Det kommer bli en hel del spännande saker att göra.\n\nDet är sånt här som gör en spelare nöjd!\n\nOch det är så här min dag ska gå. En del riktigt jobbigt på ett företag och ett upprop på facebook att kontakta en hel del personer och börja skriva in lite information.\n\nEfter att ha varit ute med T i måndags så träffade jag S ikväll.

They handed out pictures of fetuses and shouted messages such as “No choice, no chance,” “It’s a baby,” and “Hail Mary, pray for us.”\n\nRoberts said her group is concerned that the new abortion restrictions passed by the Legislature last year may cause a shortage of abortion clinics, and with that, clinics could be forced to close and women might have to travel farther to access abortion services.\n\nShe said many abortion opponents don’t want women to be able to access legal abortions.\n\n“They don’t want women to have a choice,” she said. “They are in opposition to the very basic idea of being able to make decisions about your own body.”\n\nShe added, “I think they’re trying to scare women into thinking they have no choice.”\n\nMeanwhile, abortion-rights opponents are optimistic that the recently passed law is going to affect Florida’s abortion clinics.\n\n“It’s going"
"BLOG\n\n10 sep Meat in Cooked Sausages: Are you Eating what you Think you are Eating?\n\nMeat in Cooked Sausages: Are you Eating what you Think you are Eating?\n\nPreparation and cooking of pork, chicken and other meats are not the same, the cooking time and temperature can affect the final product and the amount of fat and moisture retained.\n\nThe processes involved in the making of cooked sausages vary, but there are some key elements that all cooked sausage products should have, such as cooked meat.\n\nThis is the legal minimum in law for the word 'cooked' on sausage products and it must be clearly labelled.\n\nA healthy percentage of pork, chicken or other meat must be retained. For instance, if you buy a chicken sausage product, you should see an appropriate percentage of chicken.\n\nThe meat content in the sausage should be identified clearly on the label, so it is easy for the consumer to identify the ingredients and know exactly what is inside the product.\n\nAre you eating what you think you are eating?\n\nThere are a wide range of cooked sausages on the market and with a little detective work, the sausage meat content can be clearly identified on the pack.\n\nThis is how you can identify the sausage meat content, just have a look at the label:\n\nDoes the label indicate what the meat content is by percentages? If so, this is the best way to find out exactly what is in your sausage product. It's so simple - the lower the percentage of meat, the more processed the sausage. If the sausage is sold as fresh or raw, the label must indicate the actual weight of the meat content (pork, chicken, etc.)\n\nA percentage of pork, chicken or other meat must be labelled on the sausage. It should also have the ingredients listed in descending order. This will give you a good idea of what the product is made up of.\n\nFor instance, if the meat content is specified at 70%, this is a good indication that the product is made up of pork meat. However, you should check the label to confirm this, because there may be small amounts of added water, fat or salt, which can have an impact on the final product.\n\nIf the sausage product is labelled as 'meat product', this is a good indication that it has been cooked in water.\n\nIf it says 'meat product, so must not contain more than 12% moisture. So if you see that this is the case, you can be certain that the product is cooked in water.\n\nIf the sausage product is labelled as 'pre-cooked', this is not a guarantee that the product has been cooked in water.\n\nIt is just a statement to indicate that the meat has been treated in a way that could be described as being pre-cooked, so this is no guarantee that the meat has been cooked.\n\nEven if it has been cooked, it may still be difficult to identify the meat content because of the added water and fat.\n\nIt is therefore important to look for the meat content to ensure that it is sufficient for the product to be labelled as a cooked product.\n\nIf the sausage product is labelled as 'minced meat', 'minced' or 'minced pork', it is safe to assume that the product has been cooked in water.\n\nFor more information and guidance on food labelling, visit www.food.gov.uk/your-consumer-rights.<|endoftext|>Guess The Sport Quiz is a fun sports trivia app, covering the main sports of football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis and other sports.\n\n\n\nFind out what you know about the different sports and teams in your area of expertise.

These include repetitive graphics rendering and compute-heavy simulation tasks.\n\nRay tracing is a traditional graphics rendering technique that uses programmable processors to simulate the physical behavior of light to render lifelike images. This has always been possible with GPUs but the technique has historically been too computationally intensive for real-time rendering. This is about to change.\n\nThe Pascal architecture is the first to support a feature called “ray-tracing acceleration,” which is fundamentally a programmable feature. And with that, our understanding of what’s possible in graphics has changed forever.\n\nWhile there are already highly efficient real-time ray tracing implementations that run on traditional GPUs, they are not programmable and therefore cannot be optimized. The Pascal architecture gives developers explicit control over rays and the ability to implement custom acceleration structures tailored to specific workloads, enabling a level of programmability never before possible.\n\nBecause of this programmability, we expect to see rapid innovation in this area. For example, the architecture makes it possible to accelerate the simulation of a virtual camera system and determine the behavior of a single light ray, enabling light and sound propagation and how they interact with surfaces.\n\nThis can lead to highly realistic computer graphics. For example, these new types of light simulations could let game developers create more realistic and lifelike lighting effects. This new level of realism can have a profound impact across the entertainment industry, from movies and television to games. And it’s not just about how a game or movie looks — it’s about how it sounds, too.\n\nRay-tracing acceleration could be used to create virtual environments that respond realistically to sound, making the overall experience far more lifelike. For example, ray-tracing acceleration could be used to implement real-time reflections of sound in a scene, creating the acoustic ambience of a room or concert hall.\n\nBecause of ray-tracing acceleration, it’s now possible to produce images and sounds that were not previously possible in real-time graphics. With the power of Pascal, developers can now build applications that can realistically render and simulate the physical behavior of light. We’re looking forward to the amazing graphics and audio experiences this is going to enable.\n\n© NVIDIA Corporation<|endoftext|>Star of Ash by David Kirkpatrick is the gripping and thrilling tale of how, from the midst of despair, the crippled and abandoned Star of Ash rises like a phoenix to the clouds of fame and acclaim.\n\nThis captivating novel tells of a man, his family, and their determination to overcome the many obstacles and trials in their lives.

(L.E. Baskow/AP)\n\nMMA fans were taken aback Wednesday when reports surfaced that the Ultimate Fighting Championship was close to a sale to talent agency WME-IMG for $4 billion. Now, UFC president Dana White has confirmed the news.\n\n“It’s a crazy, crazy deal,” White told Fox Sports Live on Wednesday night. “It’s gonna bring a lot of equity into the company. It’s gonna bring a lot of cash, obviously. The legacy of this thing is big, big, big. This is going to be a great thing for this sport and for this company.”\n\nThe deal, which is still pending approval by the UFC’s owners, will make WME-IMG the majority owner of the UFC, with the promotion’s current owner, the Fertitta family, retaining a minority stake in the company. It will be the second-largest deal in sports history behind WME-IMG’s acquisition of Professional Bull Riders in January for $100 million.\n\nWME-IMG is the same talent agency that represents UFC stars such as Ronda Rousey, Conor McGregor and Jon Jones. White will stay on as president of the UFC, which will remain in its current headquarters in Las Vegas.\n\n“They’ve done a great job with a lot of companies,” White said of WME-IMG. “A lot of the other companies they’ve bought are smaller than this. But this is going to be great for our sport.”\n\nThe UFC has struggled financially in the past year as it moved from a pay-per-view model to a television package. The UFC is currently in the second year of a seven-year deal with Fox that allows it to showcase five fight cards on broadcast television as well as four pay-per-view cards annually.\n\nThe UFC expects to put on more than 40 shows in 2016, which would make it a busier schedule than any year in its history.\n\n“Our new partnership with WME-IMG will provide the UFC with strategic growth opportunities,” White said in a statement. “Our new ownership group is the perfect fit for the UFC and will open doors to take this sport to the next level.”<|endoftext|>Al Jazeera English interviewed the Center’s director, Sarah Holewinski, for a story on veterans’ homelessness in the US.

Si se sabe la hora exacta de la fecundación, a partir de ahí se puede estudiar si hay alguna interacción entre la fecundación y la implantación”, comentó el profesor Agustín Pastor, investigador en la Universidad de Granada.\n\n\n\nComo es conocido, existen diferentes técnicas para la fecundación in vitro, tales como el inseminación artificial con suero de varón, inseminación intrauterina (donde se inyecta el esperma en el conducto genital de la mujer) y inseminación intracitoplasmática de esperma (donde se inyecta el esperma en el interior de la célula que fertilizará a la mujer).\n\n\n\nSin embargo, para la inseminación artificial no es posible medir la hora exacta de la fecundación, ya que está en función de la decisión del varón.\n\n\n\nPara la inseminación intrauterina existen problemas de seguridad por la posibilidad de que el esperma sea rechazado, mientras que la inseminación intracitoplasmática puede dar lugar a dificultades en el caso de que el esperma se quede atascado dentro de la mujer.\n\n\n\nDe ahí que la investigación vaya orientada a aplicar la inseminación intracitoplasmática en mujeres con restricción ovular, mediante el ultrasonido y una cámara láser.\n\n\n\n“Para la inseminación intracitoplasmática se usa la técnica de inseminación in vitro, que consiste en esperma y óvulo. Estos se colocan en una placa de vidrio que se conecta a una maquina que se llama centro. Se realiza una primera fase que consiste en medir el tiempo de la inseminación”, explicó Pastor.\n\n\n\nEn el caso de las mujeres con restricción ovular se hace una segunda fase en la que se conecta la placa con un ultrasonido que permite medir la tasa de número de embarazos de una paciente, “ya que la paciente tiene un porcentaje muy bajo de tener embriones, de ahí que sea necesario controlar que la inseminación tiene lugar”.\n\n\n\nUna vez realizada la fase de ultrasonido, la placa se conecta con la cámara láser y en función del tiempo de inseminación se inyecta el esperma.\n\n\n\nEsta novedosa técnica “facilita mucho la implantación y nos permite estudiar el tiempo de implantación y tener un control más eficaz”.\n\n\n\nPara determinar si el esperma se ha implantado correctamente, se analiza si se produce una reacción celular en el útero, es decir, si se detectan más células que las originales, que es lo que suele ocurrir.\n\n\n\nInvestigadores como el profesor Pastor trabajan con diferentes centros de investigación en España y en el extranjero para aplicar esta técnica en diversos casos, “para aplicar la investigación al tratamiento del envejecimiento, en la fertilidad y en la reproducción asistida”.\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>List of Websites and Forums that you are free to use for the giving of personal ads.

"Yearly Meeting clerk David Chappell, who joined us in the studio in January 2018, will be meeting up with the members of the House of Bishops, who are due to visit Tyneside in February 2019. He reports back on the latest news and details of the 2019 event, the tenth of its kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year, the Bishops visit the meetings of the Methodist Church in their Province to listen to the stories of our work and witness the work of God in the lives of our local communities. It's a great opportunity for us to hear the stories of others and share in what God is doing in our churches.\n\n\n\nIt's a great honour for Tyneside to be chosen as one of the 2019 stops for the Bishops' visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Bishops visited parts of the North East of England, and heard a wide range of stories, from St Kentigern's, Burnmoor, Whitley Bay, to Monkton Stadium, Sunderland, and also saw the work of our Youth and Children's departments, which both won national awards.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Tyneside will host the Bishops at Bishop Middleham School in Durham, and at John Gladstone School, Newcastle. It will also be our opportunity to celebrate our work in being awarded Christian Schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bishops will then meet for lunch at the Masonic Lodge, on Tuesday 13th February, before travelling back to London.\n\n\n\nThe Committee which is organising the event has been working hard to arrange transport and travel for all the Bishops, their wives, and the lay members of their staff. They have already had several meetings to arrange and confirm the details. We have arranged a coach to collect the Bishops from Bishop Auckland, and the next step is to sort out all the details for the visit to Durham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year we are also celebrating the 400th anniversary of the birth of George Herbert. The Bishop of Durham, Rt. Revd Paul Butler, will be leading a service at Durham Cathedral to celebrate the life and ministry of George Herbert on the evening of Monday 12th February. It would be great to have as many people as possible attending, as it's a chance to be a part of something which will have a big impact in Durham, and also across the country.\n\n\n\nWe hope to see you in Durham and for the visit to Bishop Middleham School, Bishop Auckland, on Tuesday 13th February, for a great time of fellowship.\n\n\n\nClick here to find out more about the 2019 Bishops’ Visit to the North East.\n\n<|endoftext|>+ --------------------------------------------------------------------- + | Ultimate Guitar Tabs Archive - your #1 source for tabs! | | http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/ | | | | Over 1,000,000 guitar, guitar pro and bass tabs!

"Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story (マリオ&ルイージRPG ボスの肉球) is a role-playing video game in the Mario & Luigi series, developed by AlphaDream for the Nintendo DS. It was published by Nintendo and was released in Japan on January 29, 2009, in North America on January 12, 2010, in Australia on February 11, 2010 and in Europe on February 19, 2010. A remake, titled Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey, was released in 2019 for the Nintendo 3DS as a 3D remake.[4] The story revolves around Bowser, who is knocked unconscious and awakens to find himself kidnapped by the mysterious Vacuum Mushroom Fiasco.[5] In the process of searching for Bowser, Mario and Luigi become absorbed into his body, causing them to travel through his body to retrieve the cure.[5]\n\nThe game utilizes the Nintendo DS's dual screens to present battles with a top-down view on the bottom screen and the area players are in on the top screen. While traveling through Bowser's body, the players solve puzzles and fight enemies, with Mario and Luigi sharing an HP bar.[5] The game was positively received by critics, who praised the story and humor, and was a commercial success, selling over 2 million copies worldwide by May 2010.[6]\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nMario and Luigi travel through Bowser's body solving puzzles.\n\nThe game has traditional role-playing video game gameplay with an overworld-style map on which the player navigates. Bowser's body is shown in the top screen, with the touch screen presenting an isometric view of the area that Mario and Luigi are exploring. Battles take place on the top screen, with the touch screen showing a close-up of the characters, allowing the player to touch the stylus to perform attacks.[7] Mario and Luigi can choose commands from a list of action commands in order to fight enemies; for example, a coin can be thrown at an enemy, or a hammer can be used to hit them. These abilities can be leveled up for increased power and range.[5] Mario and Luigi share an HP meter, which decreases if one is hit; after a character is hit, he loses the ability to jump and dodge, and the player must direct him to an area that restores health.[5] HP is restored by collecting crystals dropped by enemies, as well as by getting hit by a heart dropped by a defeated ally, though if both Mario and Luigi's HP reaches 0, the game ends.[5]\n\nThe story progresses through minigames and puzzle-solving. Bowser can find and eat special Mushrooms that grant the player special powers for a limited time; for example, the Vacuum Mushroom allows Bowser to inhale enemies.[5] These powers are required to complete some puzzles; for example, the Vacuum Mushroom is used to clear away fog that is obscuring the player's view, while the Spring Mushroom allows Bowser to reach high areas.[5] Throughout the game, the player will need to use Bowser to participate in minigames; for example, the Microgames minigame, which consists of quick minigames that award players coins.[8] The coins collected from these minigames are then used to buy things such as new attacks and life restoration items from the in-game shop.[9] Some of these minigames involve using the microphone of the Nintendo DS.[10] The player can also train Goombas and Troopas in the \"Goomba Town\" area, in which they become stronger and sometimes find better treasure when defeated in battle.[5]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nPrincess Peach writes a letter to Mario and Luigi, who are relaxing at home with Princess Peach and Toadsworth, and encloses a mysterious map of a faraway land. Mario, Luigi, and Toadsworth decide to go on an adventure to the land on the map, which is the Beanbean Kingdom. Meanwhile, Princess Peach's voice actor, Pianta, is recording a song at Sunshine Coliseum when she is kidnapped by a talking, dog-like tree named Giogio, along with her bodyguards, Mack and Bowletta. Princess Peach is dragged into a whirlpool that was created by the tree, and is transported to the Beanbean Kingdom.\n\nMario and Luigi's ship is suddenly sucked into the whirlpool, sending them and the ship falling into the Beanbean Kingdom, right in front of the tree. The tree informs Mario and Luigi that he had kidnapped Princess Peach to make her his wife, but she managed to escape. After Mario and Luigi confront the tree, they eventually meet Bowser, who had been sleeping in the nearby Mushroom Kingdom until the tree awoke him. Bowser is attacked by the tree and swallowed by him, sending Mario, Luigi, and the ship plummeting to the ground. Mario and Luigi survive the crash, but the ship is destroyed, forcing them to travel through the body of the tree and search for a way to defeat the tree. They soon find Bowser, who is running away from the tree, and help him escape, using a vacuum device built by the Stromboli Brothers.\n\nThe three set off to find the tree's weakness. The tree attempts to stop them by creating multiple Peach-bots to trick Mario and Luigi, but they defeat all of them. They then encounter Prince Peasley, who, after being defeated in battle, informs them that they must find the Great Fiery, Mushbert, to learn about the tree's weakness. After fighting their way through Fungitown, they find Mushbert, who reveals that the tree is vulnerable when attacked from within. The group then battles Queen Bean, and heads to the Starch Factory to attempt to gain access to the tree's brain. However, they find that they need a disguise to enter, so they head to Joke's End to buy disguises.\n\nBowser and the Mario Bros. after reaching the tree's brain\n\nAt the Joke's End shop, they are unable to find any disguises. Mario finds a strange, small, one-eyed creature named Fawful, who informs the group that they must meet his master, the \"Dark Mage\" Cackletta. Bowser immediately hates Fawful, and attacks him. Mario, Luigi, and Bowser eventually manage to defeat Fawful, who is crushed by a rock. While searching for Cackletta, they find an area in which Bowser is needed to progress; in the area, they encounter Prince Peasley, who has been driven insane by Cackletta's magic. After defeating him, Bowser gains the ability to become Giga-Bowser by eating a Vacuum Shroom. The group heads to Chucklehuck Woods to find Cackletta, but is unable to find her.\n\nMario and Luigi meet Cackletta, disguised as a fortune teller named Sybil. She takes the brothers to the part of Bowser's brain where the tree resides. There, they find Princess Peach, who was saved by Cackletta earlier. Bowser then attempts to protect Peach, but is knocked unconscious by Cackletta. Cackletta uses her magic to turn Luigi into a zombie; the transformation is reverted when Mario gives Luigi a Vitamins. Cackletta then attacks Mario with a magical spell that is unleashed from a machine she has. Bowser is revived by Princess Peach, and she and Bowser travel with Mario and Luigi to confront Cackletta. Bowser, Mario, and Luigi battle Cackletta and her assistant, Fawful, and defeat them. Bowser then swallows Cackletta, but Cackletta attacks Mario and Luigi with a spell while still inside Bowser. The brothers are turned into babies. Peach, shocked at seeing Bowser unconscious after the attack, approaches him. Bowser wakes up and attempts to kidnap Peach again, but then he sees that Mario and Luigi are no longer themselves, and changes his mind. He agrees to help the brothers defeat the tree.\n\nThe group heads to the tree's brain, where they discover that it is guarded by Broggy. After they defeat Broggy, the group enters the tree's brain and begins battling the tree's internal organs. Bowser starts destroying the tree from the inside by consuming the Vacuum Shroom he had earlier. After the group finds Princess Peach, they battle Cackletta and Fawful again, and defeat them. The brothers revert to their adult selves, and Mario and Luigi celebrate by dancing and singing. However, the celebration is interrupted by a sudden attack from the tree, and everyone falls to the ground. Bowser appears to be unconscious, and Mario and Luigi are turned into babies again. Princess Peach is missing, and a now-insane Prince Peasley kidnaps her. The three then discover that the tree is attempting to destroy Beanbean Castle Town.\n\nThe brothers, with the help of Peasley and Peach, battle the tree. After defeating the tree, Peach and Bowser leave the area to check on the castle. Mario and Luigi chase after Cackletta and Fawful, who have returned to the castle ruins. They fight Cackletta and Fawful once more and defeat them. Cackletta then revives Bowletta with her magic, who, while wearing a dark helmet, attacks the brothers. After Bowletta's defeat, the brothers learn that Cackletta has revived Queen Bean. Cackletta and Bowletta then fuse with the Queen, becoming the Beanstar. Mario and Luigi battle the beanstalk, and manage to destroy it by attacking the part of the Beanstar that contains Cackletta and Bowletta. The Beanstar falls to the ground and lands on Queen Bean, destroying the Beanstar and killing Queen Bean.\n\nAfter defeating Cackletta and Bowletta, Bowser goes to the castle, and"
"I had a wonderful stay at Casa Para, and can’t wait to go back! Not only was it a beautiful place with an awesome view, the staff is amazing. The hosts were incredibly accommodating, with good communication from the time of booking to arriving in the house. The house was very clean and organized, with all the amenities one could need and more! The area was wonderful and we were able to get to the nearby town of San Marcos in 10 minutes, and it was a really lovely town to explore! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!<|endoftext|>Centuries ago the Aral Sea was a vast freshwater lake with no outlet. Today, it has been almost completely reduced to a couple of brackish lakes. But now this disappearing ecosystem is the site of a huge experiment on the possibility of using natural processes to undo environmental damage. An effort is under way to reflood a part of the Aral Sea that has been dry since the 1960s.\n\nThe Aral Sea, in central Asia, has long been known for its commercial fish. But since 1960, its waters have been steadily drying up. First, the Soviet Union diverted water from the two rivers that fed the sea, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya. The aim was to grow wheat on the newly irrigated land. Then the U.S.S.R. did the same with what was left of the Aral Sea.\n\nThe Aral Sea has been reduced by 50 percent. It is about one-third of its former size. With no fresh water flowing in and only brackish water flowing out, the Aral Sea has become a big lake, minus the life in the lake.\n\nBut now a joint effort is under way to reflood the part of the sea that was once part of Kazakhstan. That project, the largest-ever ecological restoration, is led by the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas, or I.C.A.R.D.A.\n\nNizami Toloyan, director of I.C.A.R.D.A. in Uzbekistan, says that restoring the Aral Sea's ecosystem is extremely important for the region.\n\n\"It is very important to save this unique nature,\" said Mr. Toloyan. \"We have to save it. The only chance to do this is to restore the sea. There is no other way.\"\n\nFrom the air, it is apparent why there is only one way to save the Aral Sea. From space, you can see the vast desert, spread over almost 250,000 square kilometers, as well as the network of canals and fields irrigated with brackish water.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, the then-independent Uzbekistan took over the lower part of the Aral Sea. But in the past few years, the dam at the mouth of the Syr Darya, which is the last remaining source of water, has developed leaks.\n\nExperts believe the volume of water is about to decline further.\n\nIn the past decade, the sea has been gradually disappearing, as its water evaporates, leaving the salinity behind. So far, only about a meter of water has evaporated from the sea, but further shrinkage could leave the bottom dry.\n\nAn unusual alliance of government and nongovernment groups is working to reverse the Aral Sea's decline.\n\nWater from the Syr Darya is being diverted to its upper section, which is partly reflooded and partly maintained as a river. The Amu Darya is being diverted as well.\n\nSpecial channels have been dug to reduce the salinity of the Aral Sea's outflow. They are meant to protect the sensitive lower part of the sea and slow its shrinking.\n\nOfficials hope that within a few years the sea will be stable. A reservoir, which will be filled by rivers and the waters of the Aral Sea itself, is being created. This reservoir, which is expected to be some 400 kilometers in length, is meant to help restore the Aral Sea ecosystem.\n\nUzbek officials say that about $300 million has been invested in the project so far. An estimated $20 million is needed each year for the next several years.\n\nWith the help of experts from Russia, Kazakhstan and the United States, Uzbekistan has decided to restore a lake the size of 20,000 square kilometers, more than half the size of Lake Superior. But this will not restore the Aral Sea as a whole.\n\nSome scientists believe that what has been done so far is not enough. They argue that it is not enough to restore just one part of the Aral Sea.\n\n\"The way the rest of the Aral Sea is shrinking, in 10 years the shoreline will be very close to these lakes,\" said Chris Reij, director of the World Wetlands International. \"We do not think that in the long term this is a way to save the sea. The sea needs to be restored. It needs to be reflooded.\"\n\nI.C.A.R.D.A. agrees, but it says the challenge of bringing water to the entire Aral Sea is greater.\n\nOne of the main problems is that the Amu Darya River, which is the main water source, flows through politically unstable countries and is polluted with industrial waste. Experts say the water quality must be improved before it is used for the Aral Sea restoration project.\n\nOfficials say the sooner the Amu Darya is brought back to a natural state, the better. But they say that will take decades.<|endoftext|>There’s no denying that cats can be evil. And cute. Sometimes you want them to be cute and not evil. It’s one of the many paradoxes of feline ownership. But I’m pretty sure that if a cat is being really, really cute and precious, then it must be plotting to kill something, if not you, then a house plant.\n\nCase in point: This cat being super sweet to a pillow. I mean, a cat on a pillow! Cuuuute. Oh, and that cat is also licking its own butthole.\n\nI like to imagine that the cat in the picture is watching over a shelf full of all his past victims.

The study is based on the responses to a questionnaire filled out by the asylum seekers themselves.\n\nAccording to the survey conducted by the Economist, people from poor countries, in their attempt to flee from the political and economic conditions of their native countries, pay thousands of pounds to make the dangerous sea journey to Britain. They travel in small boats that are overcrowded and not seaworthy. This leads to accidents at sea where many asylum seekers lose their lives. Once they reach Britain they live in small, overcrowded hostels. They live in very difficult conditions. Their only source of income is state aid. As their life is very difficult and as they have no means to improve their financial position, many of them suffer from mental illness. This leads to an increase in crime rate, theft and prostitution. They also suffer from abuse by landlords, the police and the local population.\n\nAccording to the survey, most of the respondents stated that they wanted to stay in Britain. They stated that they have received proper education in their native countries and as such are very keen to go back to their native countries. The respondents were of the opinion that their situation is a temporary one and they wish to go back to their home countries when their country is safe for them to go back. Many asylum seekers are already married and their families are in their native countries. They wished that they would be able to get jobs and stay in their native countries, rather than live in the poor conditions of Britain. The asylum seekers have stated that they wish to have a better future and as such are willing to go back to their home countries. The asylum seekers are of the opinion that the British government should support their effort to go back to their native countries.\n\nAccording to the survey, the respondents were worried about the future of their children. The children of asylum seekers, like their parents, suffer from poverty and are unable to get education. They feel ashamed as they cannot afford to buy clothes and books. They feel that their situation is unfair as they do not have the same rights as the other children.\n\nThere are many people who are willing to work in order to support their families. As many of the respondents were highly qualified and highly educated, they would like to work for their families, for the British government or for their country. The respondents stated that their experience, skills and knowledge would be of great use to the British economy and government.\n\nThe asylum seekers are keen to be able to live with their families and are keen to work in order to contribute to their families. Their main concern is the fear that if they leave Britain they would be tortured by their own government. They stated that the British government should provide them with documentation in order to enable them to go back to their countries. They believe that if they are able to get passports and official documents from the British government, it will enable them to return to their countries.\n\nAccording to the survey, the asylum seekers are aware of the fact that Britain is at war with Iraq. They believe that the government should intervene to stop the war. They do not want to be caught in the crossfire. The respondents are aware of the fact that many people are taking up arms against the British forces. They stated that the British government should do something to prevent such activities and they believed that the British government should work towards peace. They also stated that the British government should"

These expenses include the cost of transportation, meals and lodging while away from home overnight.\n\nWhile on a business trip, you can deduct the cost of lodging (including hotels, motels, and resorts) if it is reasonable and you pay for it yourself.\n\nIf you travel for the employer, the employer will pay for your lodging. But to deduct the lodging expense, the lodging must meet the IRS definition of a “taxable fringe benefit.” The tax law gives special treatment to employer-paid lodging in an employee’s home city or town or in another area where the employer requires the employee to sleep. But the employer-paid lodging does not qualify as a “taxable fringe benefit” if it is for lodging outside these areas, even if the employee must sleep in the lodging.\n\nHowever, if the employee stays in a hotel, motel, or resort while working at a temporary job location away from home, the IRS will allow you to deduct travel expenses as a business deduction. You can deduct travel expenses even if you pay them with money the employer gave you.\n\nTravel expenses that you deduct for work-related travel away from home are also subject to the 2% limit on miscellaneous itemized deductions. So be sure to keep all your receipts and records.\n\nWe’re here to help you.\n\nCall us today at (702) 468-4444. We are located at 9333 W.

Cooper said that he believes the research firm is using “cherry-picked” clips.\n\n“I just don’t think it’s fair. And I think it’s ridiculous. It’s so obviously not true,” he said.\n\nStelter said that Cooper’s coverage had been far more negative in previous months but appeared to turn more positive in recent weeks.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the improvement in Trump’s numbers is seen in the shows where the tone has improved,” Stelter said.\n\n“When you cherry-pick stuff and you say, ‘here’s two seconds where he said something negative,’ and then you take a 30-second segment and say, ‘Look how negative he is.’ It’s just not true,” Cooper replied. “It’s ridiculous. It’s absurd.”\n\n“No, it’s not,” Stelter replied.\n\nStelter said that the organization showed more clips that were more negative toward Trump than positive.\n\n“I’m not going to continue to argue with you,” Cooper said.\n\n“If you’re right, then, why did the tone improve on the air?” Stelter asked.\n\n“The tone improved on the air because it was more interesting to show the diversity of opinion that was out there,” Cooper said.\n\nThe media analyst said that Cooper was wrong and that the “tone has improved” on his show.\n\nCooper appeared baffled and disagreed with Stelter.\n\n“I think you’re cherry-picking clips,” he said.\n\nYou can Follow Nick on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Only two states—New Hampshire and New Jersey—expressly prohibit the practice, but New Jersey’s law is not clear if it extends to autonomous vehicles, according to the SAE.\n\nMore than half of the states also require drivers to be seated while operating a vehicle, but the existing laws vary widely in whether they are enforced for autonomous vehicles. For example, at least 12 states specifically exempt autonomous vehicles from such regulations.\n\nMeanwhile, some rules that apply to drivers are difficult to enforce when there is no person behind the wheel.\n\nNearly half of the states, for example, prohibit drivers from using a mobile device while parked on a highway. And a similar number of states ban a person from riding in a vehicle’s bed while the vehicle is in motion, according to the report. But it would be difficult for a law enforcement official to spot a person in the back of a vehicle, for example, without a camera mounted on the vehicle, the report noted.\n\nSuch a problem could arise if a vehicle is occupied only by an autonomous vehicle operator"
"A constipação infantil pode ser classificada em três grupos: normal (transitória, durante o período de esvaziamento gástrico), aguda (resultante de uma obstrução mecânica do trato intestinal, na maioria das vezes por sujeira fecal) e crônica (devido à falta de higiene).\n\nO processo inflamatório na musculatura do esôfago e do estômago pode levar a alguns outros problemas como a gastroenterite, no caso dos menores de 12 meses e infecções nos ouvidos, nasais e oculares (nos de maior idade).\n\nEntre os recém-nascidos, a causa mais comum é a obstrução mecânica ocorrida na formação da primeira dentição. Isso ocorre devido a uma falta de acúmulo de proteínas solúveis e consequente absorção de alimentos para que a criança mantenha um bom metabolismo.\n\nNa criança mais velha, a obstrução mecânica pode ocorrer por desequilíbrios do sistema imunológico, fatores genéticos e, principalmente, falta de higiene. As consequências da constipação vão muito além de um apenas incomodo e podem causar problemas cardíacos, vômitos frequentes, prisão de ventre, sangramentos, perda de peso e até o problema mais grave: morte.\n\nDiarreia aguda: novos desafios\n\nNa diarreia aguda, também conhecida como cólica, a maior preocupação dos pais é a quantidade de líquidos que devem ser oferecidos para evitar a desidratação. Essa séria situação pode surgir em qualquer idade, mas costuma ocorrer em crianças de 12 meses ou menores, quando ainda não têm hábito de uso de papinha, que pode levar a um alto número de diarreia.\n\nAlém disso, os novos cuidados com a diarreia, como uso de antitérmicos e líquidos de hidratação, exigem uma mudança na maneira como os pais administram a criança.\n\nÉ necessário acompanhar com mais frequência a frequência de evacuações e usar exames de urina para determinar o teor de ureia e sódio.\n\nAssim como o uso de antibióticos, os diuréticos e líquidos para hidratação, podem causar complicações como hipertensão arterial, infecção urinária, acidose metabólica e aumento de volume sanguíneo.\n\nAssim, é necessário que os pais realizem tudo isso de forma criteriosa e até pedir orientação médica para o diagnóstico e tratamento, em caso de problemas.\n\nJá em um recém-nascido ou de colo, a higiene deve ser ainda mais rigorosa.\n\nAs chances de a diarreia causar complicações são maiores e, quando não diagnosticadas, podem causar perda de água e de sais minerais, sangramento, não crescimento e, em casos mais graves, morte.\n\nAqui, a situação costuma ocorrer com frequência entre os bebês que fazem uso do leite artificial. Como os alimentos desse tipo são de origem industrial, têm alto nível de amido, que aumenta o trânsito intestinal, o que causa a diarreia.\n\nCrianças mais velhas, como os de até um ano, costumam ter como causa da diarreia a ingestão de sujeira, temperos e gorduras, além de uso de alimentos fora de prazo, carne crua e alimentos contaminados.<|endoftext|>Description\n\nDesigned by Catherine Kerr, The House of the Nightwalker began as an endeavor to get some of the most obscure texts in the history of the English language into the public domain. At present, Catherine Kerr has released a collection of texts and fragments written by the infamous Charles d’Hocquincourt (died 1463). D’Hocquincourt was a great collector of magical texts and owned some of the most significant collections in the history of Western occultism. D’Hocquincourt’s House of the Nightwalker is a collection of magical texts and fragments written and collected by d’Hocquincourt during his lifetime.\n\nThe House of the Nightwalker comprises two parts. The first part is a facsimile of d’Hocquincourt’s Book of the Nightwalker, a collection of rituals and alchemical processes attributed to Edward Kelley, a 16th century alchemist and spiritualist. In this volume, d’Hocquincourt includes the texts translated from a variety of sources in Latin, English, Italian, German and French.\n\nThe second part is an English translation of d’Hocquincourt’s Notebooks, which comprise works written in his own hand and works copied from the works of others, all of which he found interesting and valuable. This section includes a wide variety of subjects and is composed of alchemical and astrological texts, rituals, and fragments on the ars notoria, and other topics, including talismans, conjurations, spirits, incubi, and sabbats.\n\nThis work is important as a source for the study of alchemy, ceremonial magic, and the early history of the European Hermetic tradition.\n\nThis book is featured in our selection of 101 Books that Shaped Magick.<|endoftext|>Shawn Ashmore, the brother of actress Danielle (aka Anna Paquin, star of “The Piano”), played mutant Iceman in the first two X-Men movies and has signed up to appear in two more. Now he’s returning to television in “Two and a Half Men” opposite Ashton Kutcher.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been around that show for so many years,” Ashmore tells PopcornBiz, “and it’s been a great ride. We’ve all seen a lot of changes happen, and I think it’s all very cool.”\n\n\n\nThe role is the first he’s taken in a long time, which the 29-year-old says was a deliberate decision: “I wanted to take a little break from acting and try something new, and this was a great opportunity.”\n\n\n\nHe says he’s excited to work with the Two and a Half Men ensemble, particularly the comedy king himself, Ashton Kutcher: “He’s a really nice guy and very humble. It’s great to have him on set.”\n\n\n\nIceman returns for two more X-Men movies\n\nThe first X-Men was filmed almost four years ago, but now that it’s finished shooting, what is Shawn Ashmore’s favorite memory?\n\n“Getting to play a superhero. That’s the biggest memory, I think, that’ll always stick with me,” he tells PopcornBiz. “I don’t think I’ll ever be in a film that big, where I get to be a superhero, so I’m looking forward to the next one. I think they’re gonna do a really good job with it. I’m excited.”\n\nAshmore’s brother Aaron, as well as his twin sister Kate, also appeared in the X-Men movie, as Pyro and Marrow, respectively. Did they advise him to take the role?\n\n“They were encouraging. They said, ‘It’s the biggest movie you’re going to be in,’ and I had to really think about it,” he recalls. “But in the end, I thought it was a great role to play, and I wanted to do it. I thought the character was really interesting.”\n\nAshmore was only 20 when he started work on the film. Does he remember his first meeting with director Bryan Singer?\n"

It was announced on May 12, 2014, as the first game in the Tony Hawk's series since 2012's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD, and was released on September 29, 2015, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with a Microsoft Windows release on October 30, 2015. The game features a similar style of gameplay from previous Tony Hawk games, as well as supporting both online multiplayer and local split screen.\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was originally set to follow a heavily story-driven approach similar to its predecessors, featuring a sandbox-type open world environment.[4][5] However, the game underwent several changes during development and was panned by critics and fans alike upon release due to gameplay issues, with the sandbox style levels being omitted entirely.[6]\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is primarily a skating video game, similar to the previous games in the series. The game is a sandbox-style game, in which players are free to skate around levels with various missions to complete. There are a number of gameplay modes in the game, including single player, online multiplayer, and local multiplayer.[7]\n\nThe game features nine worlds and forty levels.[8] Unlike previous Tony Hawk games, it does not include a story mode. Instead, the game's story is told through cutscenes, between levels.[9] In a similar fashion to previous entries in the series, players are able to complete missions in levels to progress through the game. New to the series are Combo Quests. Completing these will result in a special Combo Meter being activated, with rewards being awarded for a high combo score.[10] The game also allows players to access most levels in any order.[11]\n\nControls in the game have been modified from earlier entries in the series.[12] The left and right sticks are used to perform basic tricks, while the right trigger is used for manual (revert) and the left trigger for special, a new type of move that allows players to perform aerial tricks with more precision.[13] The left and right triggers are also used to ollie, depending on whether the player is using the left or right stick.[12] A control scheme called \"Simple controls\" has also been introduced, which allows players to perform tricks using a single button, simplifying the gameplay.[14]\n\nDevelopment and release [ edit ]\n\nOn May 12, 2014, Activision confirmed that a new entry in the Tony Hawk's series was in development, the first since 2012's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.[15] A teaser trailer was released later that month, showing gameplay footage from the new game, along with confirmation that Robomodo was developing the title.[16] In July 2014, Activision confirmed that the game would also be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms,[17] with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions being announced soon after.[18]\n\nIt was revealed that the game was set to use a \"brand new graphics engine\",[19] though later reports suggested that it would instead be using an engine previously used in the mobile game Tony Hawk's Shred Session, developed by Canada-based developer Toys for Bob.[20][21] Activision initially refused to reveal what developer was working on the game,[22] though the developer was later revealed to be Robomodo, who previously developed 2012's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.[23][24] The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were cancelled in January 2015, with no plans to release those versions.[25] The PC version was released in October 2015.[26]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was met with negative reviews. It holds an aggregate score of 27 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 55 reviews,[1] and a 33% approval rating on GameRankings, based on 34 reviews.[2] Many critics cited the lack of game modes and poor quality graphics as the main reasons for the game's low score.["
"My plan was to drive from San Francisco to Portland, OR in 3 days with a couple of stops along the way. My primary goal for this trip was to shoot Mt. Shasta. Unfortunately, it was a rainy day in the Pacific Northwest when I arrived. I wasn’t able to drive up the mountain and had to do my hike around town.\n\nOn the first day of my trip I had visited Mt. Shasta in the morning and drove to the city of Medford, OR in the afternoon to stay the night. I had a lot of thoughts going through my mind when I stepped into the hotel room in Medford. For the first time in a long time, I was totally alone, there was no one around me, no distractions.\n\nMy day started with a beautiful sunrise above the clouds, which was nothing new, but it was what came later that really got me thinking. For a few minutes I walked through town and I saw several stores that were closed because it was a Sunday, or the employees were just taking a long lunch break.\n\nI’ve been living in San Francisco for a few years now and I’m used to the busy city life. There’s always something going on, and I love that, but at the same time it also seems exhausting to me.\n\nThere’s so much activity in the city, so many people, so much noise, and so many things to do, but you also get stressed out because you can never take a break.\n\nSometimes I just want to be alone for a while and be in the nature. Being alone in the wilderness can really change your perspective and make you rethink things in your life. I know that it has changed my perspective in a big way.\n\nThe next morning, after waking up, I went outside for a walk in the park near the hotel. I wanted to take some photos for a self-portrait project that I’m working on. There was a beautiful stream and I decided to take a walk through it.\n\nThe weather was great, the sun was shining and the air was warm. When I walked down to the water, the birds were chirping around me and I felt a bit stressed and anxious. But as soon as I submerged myself in the cold water, the sounds around me faded away and I was in my own little world.\n\nAs I laid down in the water and tried to float, I started to think about my life and my future. There’s a lot of stuff going on in my life right now, and I know I have to make some important decisions that will have a big impact on my future.\n\nIt’s easy to be distracted with things going on in your life, but once you slow down and try to focus on the things that really matter to you, you can start making some important decisions and steps in your life that will help you move in the right direction.\n\nAfter a few minutes I got out of the water, dried myself off, and decided to continue my walk in the park. I love it when the water is so cold that you can’t really stand it at first, but you keep going anyway. The first couple of seconds in the water are really hard, but after that, you can’t feel anything anymore and you feel completely relaxed and refreshed.\n\nSometimes you have to push through those first couple of seconds and make it past the point of no return, and then you’ll be rewarded with some of the best moments of your life.\n\nI went back to the hotel, took a shower and packed my things to continue my journey. Driving from Medford to Eugene, OR takes about 3 hours. I spent the entire ride thinking about my future and taking some notes.\n\nI didn’t have a concrete plan or goal when I started out on this trip, but I knew that I wanted to shoot some epic landscapes. I thought about how many images I had taken and how many photos I have stored on my computer, but I still felt unsatisfied.\n\nMaybe I was chasing the wrong thing? Maybe I’m not shooting the type of photos that I like to shoot, or I’m not shooting enough photos?\n\nBut after going through a few tough weeks recently, I realized that I’m shooting the type of photos that I want to shoot, and I’m shooting a lot of photos too. I just needed to look at the bigger picture and think about what’s important to me.\n\nThis is the point where a lot of photographers will ask themselves “Am I happy?”. I’m really happy with the life I have right now. I have a beautiful girlfriend, a good job, a supportive family, and amazing friends. I have a nice car, a big apartment and a bunch of cool cameras.\n\nBut at the same time I felt something was missing. I needed something else to get myself to the next level.\n\nWhat’s next for you and your photography? What are your next steps? What are your plans?\n\nI have no idea what’s next for me, but I know that I will continue to pursue my photography and continue to improve my work.\n\n“What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” – JK Rowling\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nMore\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n<|endoftext|>With millions of voters still casting their ballots in the United States, presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made last-ditch appeals Monday to people wavering between them.\n\nWith so many voters saying they are undecided, Clinton and Trump made a final effort to convince them that they are not making a wasted vote by choosing them.\n\nVoting rights have become an important issue in the campaign. In states with large minority populations, some voters complained they were still waiting for their names to be called after hours in long lines.\n\nClinton has pressed her supporters to seize on the opportunity to elect the first woman as president.\n\nShe acknowledged that not all voters are pleased with their choices.\n\n\"I know you may still have questions for me. I respect that. I want to answer them. I want to earn your vote,\" she said.\n\n\"I am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, everyone who is as optimistic as I am, and as anxious for change as I am,\" she added.\n\nBut the woman she hopes to replace, President Barack Obama, asked Americans to give Clinton a chance.\n\n\"The American dream is something no wall will ever contain,\" he said, addressing Hispanic voters.\n\nSpeaking in New Hampshire, he said, \"I'm betting that tomorrow you will reject fear and choose hope.\"\n\nIn addition to Obama, Trump has been struggling to get support from key Republican figures.\n\nEven if he does, Trump's immediate problem is to win over the voters who backed Senator Bernie Sanders in the primaries.\n\nIn a New Hampshire rally, Sanders told supporters that he would vote for Clinton. But his endorsement came with a warning.\n\n\"The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated, and defeated badly, and I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time,\" he said.\n\nEven if Trump wins the election, Sanders said, \"it is incumbent upon [Trump] to tell the American people that he will listen to them and their needs.\"\n\nWhile Sanders spoke, protesters from the group Code Pink interrupted his speech, but were quickly escorted out.\n\nSome Republicans also said they are not going to vote for Trump. The campaign of Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte said she would not vote for either Trump or Clinton. Ayotte is locked in a tight race in New Hampshire against a Democrat.\n\nMeanwhile, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to lawmakers on Sunday, informing them that investigators had discovered emails that \"appear to be pertinent\" to an earlier probe of Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\n\nComey said that the FBI is taking steps to determine whether the newly discovered emails \"contain classified information.\"\n\nVoters were still heading to the polls in many states on Monday, including Virginia, Indiana, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nEarly voting also continues in states such as Illinois, Texas, Florida, Arizona and California.\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that would require voters to show identification before they can cast a ballot. The ruling was a victory for the Obama administration and voting rights activists, who argued the law was discriminatory against Hispanics and other minorities.\n\nRepublican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton promised an immediate appeal of the ruling, saying \"the integrity of the voting process is at stake.\"\n\nAt a news conference Monday morning, Trump said his rival's \"under-handed tactics\" could cost her victory in the presidential election.\n\nClinton's campaign said it is \"pleased\" the court \"voted to reject efforts to disenfranchise [people of color] and women.\"\n\nWith a record number of Americans registering to vote, officials are expecting a record turnout of more than 130 million ballots.\n\n\n\nThe race for the White House is also close in states considered to be battlegrounds, which have enough electoral votes to potentially swing the election. Polls suggest that they are too close to call.\n\nVoters on the eastern U.S. seaboard will be among the last to cast their ballots.\n\nPolling shows Clinton is maintaining her lead in the traditional battleground state of Florida. She is also holding on to a slim lead in North Carolina"
"Murphy looked down at the ring.\n\nHe had considered talking to God for some time now, even contemplated it, if only to tell him what he thought about his life, but he never felt that God would actually talk back, and he certainly wasn’t sure that he wanted to hear what God had to say. Besides, who was he? He was just a jerk that had been born into the wrong era. Why would God want to listen to him?\n\nBut in the middle of a quiet moment, where he wasn’t doing anything except sitting in the living room with the family, his eyes drifted to the ring, and suddenly the words came out.\n\n“God, I don’t know if you’re there, or if you’ll listen to me, but I’ve got a bone to pick with you.” Murphy said.\n\nThe family members looked at each other, completely surprised that their father would start talking to himself.\n\nMurphy waited a few moments for a response, but there was none.\n\n“You took my family from me and left me to raise them alone. You made it so that my daughter could see into the future, and that my son had the ability to control electricity. You left me a broken man. You might as well have just killed me.”\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n“And then you put me here. You told me that this is where you wanted me to be, but I’m not so sure. You took me away from the thing that made me happy, and I’ve been miserable ever since.”\n\nMurphy sat in silence for a moment, waiting for a response. He heard the wind blow, and he knew that it was nothing more than the wind, but for a second, he thought he heard a voice.\n\n“Do you hear me?” Murphy asked. “Are you going to talk to me?”\n\nMurphy closed his eyes and heard a voice. It wasn’t the voice of God. It was more of a hum, like a song that you don’t know the name of. It was just there, humming away. Murphy couldn’t make out the words, but it sounded a little like singing.\n\n“What is that?” Murphy asked. “Is that you? Are you going to speak to me?”\n\nHe didn’t hear anything more than the hum.\n\n“Okay, fine. I’m just going to keep talking then. You were right. I have been miserable. I’ve never been able to find someone that I was happy with. I’ve never been able to get a job that I liked. You made my life difficult, and you’ve made my family miserable. You’ve done nothing but cause pain to everyone around me. And for what? You were the one that decided to make me a special child, to make me into something that I’m not, and I can’t even begin to fathom why.”\n\nThere was no response.\n\n“I wish I could blame you for everything that’s happened, but I’m not going to lie to myself. I’m just as much to blame as you are. I’m the one that killed my wife. I was so caught up in trying to make her feel like she wasn’t alone that I didn’t see the pain that I was causing. You see, I had promised her that we would have a family, that I would love her and care for her for the rest of her life. But I let that slip away, because I was too selfish to see how much I was hurting her. It’s my fault that she died, and it’s my fault that the boys grew up without a mother. I didn’t even think about it. I never thought that I would lose her, and I thought that she would be there forever. I should have fought harder for her, but I didn’t, and now she’s gone.”\n\nMurphy’s eyes began to fill with tears.\n\n“That’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to admit. I’m a horrible father, and I’m a horrible husband. I’ve never been able to hold on to anything that I love. I’ve always been weak, and I’ve always allowed the people that I love to walk away. It’s my fault that they’ve gone, but it’s not all my fault. You’ve had your hand in this, too. You’ve made sure that I always have a reason to hate myself.”\n\nHe closed his eyes, and he started to feel dizzy. He had been sitting in the same position for so long, but he couldn’t bring himself to move.\n\n“What do you want me to do?” Murphy asked. “What do you want me to do now? I have no idea what to do, and I don’t know what my life is supposed to be. I never got to have the childhood that I should have had, and I’ve never been able to live up to the things that people expected of me. I’ve never been able to live up to the standards that everyone else has.”\n\nMurphy stopped talking and listened to the humming. It was there, again, just humming away. It sounded so peaceful. It was a song that he couldn’t quite place, but he could almost remember it. It was just out of his reach, though. It sounded familiar, but he just couldn’t place it.\n\n“I’m not asking for your forgiveness,” Murphy said. “I know that I’m not worthy of it. I know that I’m a horrible human being, and I know that I don’t deserve anything. I just don’t know what to do. I know that I’m a burden, and that I’ve never lived up to the expectations of anyone around me. I’m just asking you to show me what to do. I don’t know how to live this life. I don’t know how to do anything. I need to know what to do next. I need some kind of sign that tells me what to do. Please.”\n\nMurphy waited for a response. He waited for a few minutes, but nothing came.\n\n“Please,” Murphy said. “Please give me a sign.”\n\nHe looked down at the ring. It was glowing a little bit. The humming had stopped. Murphy held his hand up and stared at the ring.\n\n“Do you know what you want?” Murphy asked. “Do you know what you want me to do?”\n\nMurphy held his hand up and looked at the ring.\n\n“Do you want me to take the ring off? Is that what you want me to do?”\n\nMurphy looked at the ring and waited. There was no answer.\n\n“Or do you want me to do something else?” Murphy asked.\n\nMurphy closed his eyes and listened to the sound of the birds outside of his house. He waited for a response, but there was none. He waited for a few minutes, but he still didn’t hear anything.\n\nMurphy took a deep breath and opened his eyes. He looked down at the ring and slowly slid it off of his finger. He closed his eyes and waited. He didn’t hear anything, but he felt his chest tighten a little bit. He opened his eyes and looked down at the ring. He opened his mouth to say something, but he didn’t know what to say. He closed his eyes and held the ring in his hand.\n\nHe didn’t know what to do.\n\n“I’m so sorry.” Murphy said. “I’m so sorry for everything that I’ve done. I’m so sorry that I didn’t fight harder for you. I’m so sorry that I couldn’t keep you here with me.”\n\nMurphy held the ring for a few more seconds and then threw it on the table. He leaned back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\nHe waited.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he got up and left the room. He walked up to the bedroom, closed the door, and took a nap.<|endoftext|>Ayn Rand fans, here's the special bonus episode you've been waiting for!

"The goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of mapping poverty rates using simple statistical methods to improve upon existing efforts to do so. We found that the methods used to map poverty are based on population and economic data that were available to the Census Bureau as far back as 1960. While the full census decennial process now includes the collection of additional socioeconomic data, as well as improvements to administrative data, the basic steps required to produce a poverty map are the same. We have also demonstrated that alternative methods, such as an ordinary least squares regression method, provide estimates of poverty rates that are quite similar to the estimates produced by the method employed by the Census Bureau. The major difference is that the alternative method has the potential to be improved and more accurately used over time.<|endoftext|>Is bad luck is an illusion that helps us think positively about our lives?

Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.<|endoftext|>This spring, The New York Times and ProPublica reported on the deaths of 10 patients who received unnecessarily aggressive cancer treatments at a major cancer center, based on a tip from one former doctor at the center.\n\nWhat’s worse, the former doctor, Dr. Omar Malik, was fired in 2012 after a complaint from a nurse, and sued for defamation by the cancer center, Columbia University Medical Center, in 2013. A federal judge dismissed that case, and Malik sued for the right to tell his story, and won.\n\nIn May, Malik told the story of his firing and his subsequent lawsuit on the NPR show This American Life. The crux of Malik’s argument was that he was doing his job as an oncologist by giving patients the best shot at survival—even if that meant recommending more aggressive treatment.\n\nAccording to Malik, at Columbia, there was a difference between clinical care, which is based on the evidence, and “institutionalized oncology,” which is dictated by institutions. He said it’s hard to explain to patients that, while he is treating them, “I have to do it within this framework of institutionalized oncology.”\n\n“They just don’t want to hear that.”\n\nMalik said this bureaucratic dynamic led to a situation in which more patients with cancer are given more treatment than is actually helpful. “It’s not that we’re being intentionally unethical. We just got sucked into it. And there’s very little you can do. It’s so bureaucratic that it’s so hard to say no to anything,” he said.\n\nTo explain why this happens, Malik talked about the incentives of the healthcare system, in which doctors are reimbursed for treatments, not for following clinical guidelines or listening to patients. He also talked about how hard it is to say no to treatment and admit that you don’t have the right treatment for a particular patient.\n\nMalik said that one of the biggest barriers to treating cancer patients more effectively is that we think of cancer as a one-size-fits-all disease, and we don’t think about it as a group of different diseases. “They’re different,” he said. “There’s multiple different types of breast cancer, there’s multiple different types of colon cancer. And just because one person has colon cancer doesn’t mean that everyone else has colon cancer.”\n\n“These aren’t little, trivial details. They are major, major details.”\n\nThe fact that each type of cancer is different is not new. But until recently, when it came to cancer treatment, doctors were often encouraged to treat them the same, despite all the evidence that that doesn’t work. A study published in the journal JAMA Oncology last year found that, based on five different types of cancer, 80% of patients could have been spared chemotherapy had their treatment been tailored to their tumor’s characteristics.\n\n“If you think about it, it doesn’t make any sense. Why would you not take into account the type of cancer that a person has? Why would you treat all lung cancer the same way?” Malik said.\n\n“These aren’t little, trivial details. They are major, major details.”\n\nMalik said one of the challenges of being a doctor is that it’s easy to get sucked into the idea that the treatments we have now are the best that we can do.\n\n“We assume that all this is correct and all these ideas are correct. We assume that there’s nothing better,” he said. “And what you realize is that that is not true.”\n\nMalik also talked about how, before he was fired, he got a rude awakening about the reality of working in cancer medicine.\n\n“There was a point where I had to start using the books, and I had to start looking into things,” he said. “I thought I knew everything.”\n\nAfter Malik left Columbia, he went on to write a book called “A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental Illness.” The title refers to the idea that many great leaders, like Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt, suffered from mental illness.\n\nThe concept of “First-Rate Madness” comes from the book Leaders on Leadership: Conversations with America’s Best Leaders, published by the Harvard Business School in 2007.\n\n“The premise is that for every great leader that exists, there’s a real chasm between the apparent qualities that they have and the real qualities that they have. And in many cases, their strengths come from their very unique weaknesses,” Malik said. “I was really intrigued by that idea, and I thought, well, we have so many examples of these.”\n\nMalik also talked about the link between mental illness and leadership. “In many cases, it’s actually an advantage. So Abraham Lincoln’s depression enabled him to be a great leader,” he said.\n\nFor this reason, Malik’s conclusion about the way cancer medicine works is in some ways a hopeful one: “Cancer isn’t a battle to be won. It’s a condition that you can live with. And that’s a really empowering thought, that cancer is something that’s not a win-lose situation. It’s a way to live with this condition.”<|endoftext|>https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3gauo6/wp_it_has_been_just_over_a_year_since_you_and/\n\nWarning, this story is NOT a one-shot. That being said, I may or may not finish it. I don't know, so don't ask.\n\nAnyways, this is my first official original story, and I've been meaning to post it for a while. Enjoy.\n\nI woke up with the sunlight pouring into my eyes, a low groan leaving my lips as I rolled onto my side, my arm finding a warm, soft body. I smiled to myself as I closed my eyes and laid there for a minute, remembering the events from the night before.\n\nJust over a year ago, I was a very different man. I had a wife, three kids, a job, and a house. Now, I am a one-man rebellion, fighting for the rights of the genetically impaired. I've found a good group of people to travel with, and even better, I found a girl.\n\nI smiled as I opened my eyes again and looked over at her sleeping face, running my finger down her smooth cheek. My wife was always my rock, she knew what to say and do, and when she had her babies she knew exactly what to do to make me happy.\n\nMy wife, or should I say my ex-wife, was perfect, or so I thought. I couldn't stand her, but she was perfect. So, I told her I was taking her on a 'staycation'. I booked the hotel, the flight, and even got the room upgraded to the biggest suite.

The Raptors have to earn their points in a way that seems impossible, but would be most welcome: through winning the \"possession game\".\n\nThe problem the Raptors face this season is that their margin of error is very small. While they can theoretically make up for poor shooting with offensive rebounding and easy points at the rim, the big men need to score in order for that to be a viable option. So, if Bargnani and Valanciunas struggle with their shooting and are unable to get easy baskets in the paint, the Raptors will struggle to score. This means that the entire team has to shoot very well, play great defense and rebound the ball with extreme efficiency in order to score at a high level.\n\n\n\nGetting the ball in the paint with great frequency and using quick ball movement and penetration to get high-percentage shots is the path to success for this team. The problem is, the Raptors' options on offense have become somewhat limited by the available personnel.\n\nAs things currently stand, Bargnani and Amir Johnson are the primary frontcourt scorers, but their main offensive moves are a jump-hook and a turnaround jump-shot. Yes, these shots are very effective in the post, but the Raptors will have to find ways to get the ball inside to these players or else they will struggle to score.\n\n\n\nA perfect example of the challenges this poses is seen in the Raptors' win over the Boston Celtics. In this game, the Celtics did a good job of defending the pick-and-roll, which meant that penetration was difficult for the Raptors. While this isn't surprising for a team that relies heavily on its post players, the Raptor big men just aren't able to get their shots in a team setting.\n\n\n\nBargnani is not a good cutter, and when he does cut it looks awkward and unnatural. Valanciunas is much more active in finding a place to set-up for a post-up, but the guards can't be counted on to get him the ball in a position where he can score with any degree of efficiency. So, the Celtics are able to do a decent job of defending Bargnani and Valanciunas by collapsing their defense and giving them only one place to get the ball.\n\nWhen this happens, the Raptors are left with very few options to get a good look at the basket. They are forced to put the ball in their big men's hands, and have them take long shots over taller defenders. This is not a situation in which the Raptors have the personnel to succeed.\n\nThey simply can't use the players they have to get the ball to the big men, and this limits their ability to score.\n\n\n\nGetting the ball inside to their big men requires that the guards be able to drive to the basket and kick the ball out to the big men. With the current personnel, this isn't an option. Lowry and DeRozan are very good penetrators, but the frontcourt is simply too short for them to take advantage of their skill-set.\n\n\n\nThis means that the guards must look for their own offense, and the Raptors offense can become very stagnant. The current options are for Lowry and DeRozan to settle for jumpers, or get the ball to DeMar in the post. Either way, the offense tends to stop moving, and scoring opportunities become very limited.\n\nThis brings us to one of the main takeaways from the first two games of the season: the Raptor big"

At the end of 2015, the German government announced it would cut its subsidies for renewables, and the country’s policy on the environment was put under review by the newly-elected government.\n\nDespite that uncertainty, the German team pressed on with the project. At the project’s completion, it has led to three demonstrators that are ready to enter the market and will be the first battery energy storage systems for utility scale in Europe.\n\n“The technology is ready and our manufacturing partners are waiting to sell this product,” said Stephan Keese, managing director of Siemens’ business with storage systems. “Now the technology has to be tested in practice.”\n\nBy “tested in practice,” Keese means that these BESS systems will have to prove that they can work well in the field and perform in real-world applications. To do that, they will have to face challenges like over-voltage and overheating in real-world situations.\n\n“You can do this in a lab, but you cannot simulate all the phenomena that you have in real life,” Keese said. “The first step will be to get feedback from customers to understand how these systems work in practice.”\n\nAccording to the research director at Fraunhofer ISE, Martin Hofmann, the demonstration is well-designed to meet those real-world challenges. He said that the project provides a good opportunity to learn more about the technical challenges of batteries for the electric power grid, and that the results from this project will be valuable to the developers of storage systems, be it for grid or for commercial buildings.\n\n“It’s an excellent project,” Hofmann said. “It’s important that the tests are done with different grid codes and different regions.”\n\nHofmann also highlighted that the project is the first of its kind in Europe, and will provide an opportunity for other countries to learn from Germany’s experiences.\n\nThe Energy Storage Systems project is led by Siemens, supported by partners Eaton, Ford, Bundesnetzagentur and BSW and implemented by the Fraunhofer ISE.\n\nIn the field of electricity storage, Siemens and Eaton are the only manufacturers in the world that are ready to sell their products today. Together, they are a formidable force in the field, with the combined sales of their battery systems reaching a value of more than $1 billion in 2013.\n\nAfter the demonstration phase, the three battery energy storage systems will be offered to the market. Eaton’s system will have a nominal capacity of 2 megawatts and a maximum output of 6 megawatts, while Siemens’ two systems will have a nominal capacity of 2.4 megawatts and a maximum output of 8.8 megawatts. The name of the storage systems, however, are not yet known.\n\nThere is not yet a price tag for the products, but they will be installed at wind farms and solar power plants, the same way batteries are used for energy storage in homes and businesses. The difference is that the systems will have a capacity of 2.4 to 8.8 megawatts, which is the equivalent of 10 to 35,000 kWh.<|endoftext|>What was supposed to be a funny video was released on a national TV program over a year ago and yet it still doesn't make me laugh. In fact, it makes me want to throw up. This was supposed to be funny.\n\nOne of the biggest issues for me is that it was done with a child. A child that has no voice. If she is the girl I think she is, then she is probably just a teenager and was embarrassed by her mother's stupidity. A lot of the time I have seen these type of videos done by mothers (or sometimes fathers) to embarrass their kids and they usually don't end well. They don't do it to make the child laugh. They do it to make themselves laugh.\n\nThe fact that this mother is in this video says a lot. She is probably the most immature person in this video. I also don't understand how she is teaching her daughter about being \"modest.\" What if the little girl said \"I want to be a stripper when I grow up?\" Would she have recorded that too? How is she supposed to explain this to her friends and how is she supposed to feel good about herself? This child is not on the verge of adulthood. She is still a child. Her mind is like a sponge.\n\nIf the little girl did in fact ask for a belly button piercing, then I can understand the mother's need to make a video to show her child that she can't do anything she wants. She should have spoken with the little girl about why she doesn't want her to get one and then explained the consequences. Instead she decided to humiliate her in front of the world.\n\nWhen my son was little, he came to me and asked me if he could get his belly button pierced. I didn't answer him right away. Instead, I took him for a walk and explained to him that he was only four years old and I didn't think he was old enough to make that decision on his own. He was OK with it and it never came up again. There was no video made.\n\nThe child in the video may have asked for the piercing and she may not have. No matter what the reason was, I think the mother handled it"

Elle s’étonne de l’autorisation d’allaitement maternel pour des produits chimiques à l’Etat.\n\nSelon les explications du directeur général de la santé, il s’agit là d’une recommandation de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) basée sur des études scientifiques. Ainsi, dans l’autorisation d’allaitement maternel, les produits chimiques et les produits chimiques, notamment les fongicides, désherbants, l’herbicide, insecticides et les précurseurs de la mycobactérie, seront énumérés comme pouvant entrer dans l’alimentation.\n\nLes résultats de ces études scientifiques ont été produits à partir de la concentration moyenne de certains composants en Europe. Ils n’ont pas été confirmés par la CEM. Ainsi, une fois que les produits sont reconnus comme pouvant être ingérés, le ministère de la Santé est autorisé à autoriser l’allaitement maternel.\n\nLa CEM estime que cette recommandation ne prend pas en compte la résistance aux médicaments dans les produits, en particulier les antibiotiques, dans le lait maternel.\n\nSelon la CEM, il est donc nécessaire de contrôler la sécurité des médicaments par rapport aux détenteurs de licence, la génération du vaccin, le taux de contamination dans l’alimentation et les autres paramètres.\n\nLa CEM recommande également au ministère de la Santé d’accélérer le processus de retrait des produits chimiques de l’alimentation.\n\nSource : Radio Ndeke Luka\n\n(Avec le Bulletin d’information du Gouvernement, le Ministère de la Santé publique)\n\nPartagez cette actualité\n\nOpérations liées :<|endoftext|>Sailing through the dark, narrow tunnels under the pyramids and reaching the Nile.\n\nBy Gregory Scruggs\n\nAs we motored under the Nile, the stench of the sewage flowing into the river filled the air and a flock of flamingos swam past the motorboat’s bow. Passing under two massive stone tunnels, ancient sewage pipes constructed more than 4,000 years ago, and soon we entered the dark, earthen tomb of Queen Henuttawy.\n\nAs part of a three-week Nile cruise from Aswan to Cairo, we embarked on an evening excursion under the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, to explore the ancient Queen Henuttawy’s tomb.\n\nThe Nile cruise is one of the most unique ways to see the country, especially the ancient sites, and avoid the intense heat. While most tourists see the pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinx from a tour bus, we were actually on the river next to the famous monument.\n\nAs the captain slowed down the motorboat and steered toward the eastern bank, a line of three dark shafts could be seen on the western bank of the Nile. These shafts, or openings in the ground, lead to the tombs of ancient Egyptians, who were interred in the tombs with their belongings, such as furniture and jewelry.\n\nThe tomb of Queen Henuttawy is a good example of a New Kingdom shaft tomb, which were constructed during the 18th Dynasty (1550-1295 BCE). It is believed that this was the first royal burial chamber ever to be built in the area of Giza, where the great pyramids of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure were constructed. In fact, these three tombs have more in common with each other than with those of earlier kings. This is also the first time a woman, Queen Henuttawy, was buried in the vicinity of Giza.\n\nThe shaft tombs are created by digging a long, narrow, oval-shaped shaft (or hole) about 20 feet deep. They are located on the western bank of the Nile, along what was called the “road to the fields,” because this was the direction that farmers and travelers would walk toward the fields outside of the area of Giza.\n\nThe only other shaft tomb on the western bank is that of Khaemwaset, which was built more than 200 years after the Queen Henuttawy shaft tomb. The Queen Henuttawy tomb consists of a single, 5.5 meter (18 foot) long chamber cut into the rock, the walls and ceiling of which are decorated with a series of hieroglyphic texts.\n\nThe chamber is sealed by a pair of black granite blocks. An engraved picture of the pharaoh Ramses II adorns the wall. To the left of the block is the inscription: “in the year 10, the fourth month of summer, day 10, in the morning, the king was in his palace, with the Chief of Works in the House of Khnum, Monthuemhat.”\n\nNext to this is the depiction of the mummy of Queen Henuttawy being carried in a litter. A long inscription then follows, ending with the phrase: “The king did this for her.” There are four more scenes in the tomb, including one with an image of the dead Queen Henuttawy being taken in a litter to the pyramid complex.\n\nOther scenes depict Henuttawy sitting in the midst of women, which includes Queen Nebet. One image shows the goddesses Nekhbet and Bastet being carried on the backs of lions to the tomb. Another scene shows the goddess Nut pouring water from a vase onto the ground in front of the image of Queen Henuttawy.\n\nFrom a statue of a lion that is still in the tomb, it is clear that it originally had a statue of Henuttawy herself sitting on its back, but that has been lost. Another stone block in the tomb depicts two cobras on top of a basket. The snake is associated with the goddesses Isis and Nephthys.\n\nAfter this, the tomb gets very interesting.\n\nAnother block in the chamber shows four male figures standing and a female figure seated. A head of a mummy lies on the right of the seated figure. One figure is standing with his right arm extended and the left hand is on his chest. The seated figure holds a scepter in her left hand and the right arm is leaning on a chair. Behind the seated figure is another figure seated with the right leg crossed over the left and with his hands in his lap.\n\nThis seated figure is shown with a different image from the others. He wears a kilt and is wearing a crown and sitting on a chair with a scepter in his right hand and a basket in his left hand.\n\nAn accompanying inscription says: “the head of the King’s Chief Physician, Khay.” Another figure has the same crown as the first seated figure, but is shown wearing a short kilt and carrying a stick in his right hand. The name of this figure was lost to history.\n\nThe last figure shows the left arm extended and the right hand in his lap. On his head is a short wig and he is wearing a short kilt. The accompanying inscription says: “the Chief Scribe of the Necropolis, Khnumhotep,” who was also the grandson of Queen Henuttawy’s father, who served as the Chief Priest of the god Khnum, and was also known as Khnumhotep.\n\nThe only other instance in which all four male figures are depicted is in the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and they are all believed to be images of the king. These figures have been said to represent King Khufu, his son Djedefre, and his grandsons, Khafre and Menkaure.\n\nThe final block depicts the image of Queen Henuttawy being carried by two women. It shows her head and body to be wrapped in a cloth, while the arms are free."

The PSoC hardware itself is very capable and has its own UART for programming. The only problem with this method is the lack of a cable to connect the PSoC to a computer. There is an option of programming the PSoC using a special serial device, but it's not a complete solution as far as interfacing the PSoC master with other hardware is concerned.\n\n\n\nAs far as the hardware platform is concerned, I think I have decided to use the Particle Photon. It's a development board that can be purchased in kit form (i.e. with a small, low power controller board called a \"Core\") or as a ready-to-go device. It is possible to upload sketches to the Photon using a Particle development environment that runs in a web browser and uses a cloud service to program the devices, which is an interesting approach that reduces the time and effort required to setup the development environment. The boards can be purchased online from the Particle web site. I'm still researching this option, but I'm leaning towards using the Photon due to the flexibility of the development environment.<|endoftext|>Design a Logo for one of the most popular minecraft servers in the world\n\nStatus: Closed\n\nClosed Præmier: $25\n\n$25 Modtagne indlæg: 53\n\n53 Vinder: thekalex\n\nWinner\n\nKonkurrence Instruktioner\n\nI have a really small budget.\n\n\n\nI need a logo for a minecraft server, it is called [login to view URL]\n\n\n\nIt is a 24/7 hardcore server.\n\n\n\nIt will be for a steam application as well as a website.\n\n\n\nThe logo will be used for a few platforms so please take this into consideration when designing.\n\n\n\nMake it look professional.\n\n\n\nPlease keep the fonts to a minimum.\n\n\n\nThe winner will also get paid extra for the next project.\n\nAnbefalede Evner<|endoftext|>Abstract\n\nNAMED ANNE for the woman whom he fell in love with at Cambridge in England, Antaeus was published anonymously by Ronald Firbank in 1921. The novel’s title refers to a mythological giant of the earth who, after killing his father, Poseidon, god of the sea, received a temporary life-extending power by touching the ground of his native land. Antaeus is at once a pastoral, a philosophical novel, and a novel of ideas, written in a highly subjective style, alternately whimsical and solemn, with little narrative plot. The philosophical dialogue at the heart of the novel is, in Firbank’s own words, “unquestionably the most serious” discussion of the meaning of human existence. The heart of the novel is its chapter-long philosophical dialogue, set in June 1909, in the “small octagonal bedroom” of a country house in the English countryside. Firbank’s dialogue contrasts two ways of thinking about life: the skeptical, unappreciative way of Bernard, and the intellectual way of Ronald. While Firbank provides a general philosophical perspective, the characters express their own views. Bernard does so quite unconvincingly. His thought process is episodic, and he characteristically responds with clichés and hasty platitudes, rather than with carefully considered thought.\n\nBut Firbank’s major work, which he completed in 1920, was the novel Inclinations. First published in the United States in 1924, Inclinations is a sensualist novel, and an example of what Firbank calls “new sensualism,” a novelistic genre that—like its eighteenth-century prototype, Richardson’s Pamela—affirms the place of physical attraction in human relations. The four characters in Inclinations are: Michael, a civil servant; Michael’s mother, Lady Mary; Margaret, Michael’s fiancée; and Catherine, the female protagonist. Firbank provides much physical detail, but he leaves sexual activity to the reader’s imagination. Michael’s mother and Catherine are the two central characters in the novel. Lady Mary is an unhappy, frustrated woman who gives the novel its title, “Inclinations.” An unhappy wife to a man who was old enough to be her father, she had a brief but passionate affair with a young Russian countess, whom she subsequently envied and reviled. Lady Mary is a sensualist in a more important sense: She cannot bear to be without pleasure. In particular, she cannot bear to be without sensual pleasure. After her husband’s death, she lives alone in the family mansion. She travels the countryside and surrounding villages, in the summer and at other times, seeking romantic adventures. She is too old for physical pleasure, but she takes enormous pleasure in relating to other people. Her house is full of pictures of her adventures. She finds pleasure in listening to Michael and Catherine tell their love story. The house is like an Aladdin’s cave of sensual pleasures. She gives them an enthusiastic welcome and sets about making their home into a sensualist haven. Catherine is Michael’s wife. She is about twenty-two years old, and she is a sensualist in the most ordinary, everyday sense. “Her sensuality was deep and complete,” Firbank says, “like that of a child or a dog” (37). Catherine’s sensualism is the sensualism of passion, and in her case, as in so many others, the passion takes a sexual form. Michael is a sensualist, but not in the most ordinary, everyday sense. He and his mother are close, and Firbank presents them as loving one another. Firbank’s theme is their relation, rather than the sexual relation between them. But Firbank’s novel has a second theme. He has another focus. He is fascinated by the relation between Catherine and Lady Mary. He has a second sensualist couple, which is a parallel couple. The relation between these two women is central to the novel, and is highly erotic. As with Lady Mary’s and the Russian countess’s relation, so the relation between Catherine and Lady Mary is highly sensual. The relation between the two women is physical. When the three of them live together, Lady Mary “stands very near” Catherine (34). Lady Mary “cuddles” Catherine. Catherine sleeps in Lady Mary’s room. Lady Mary “eats her food at the same table as Catherine.” She takes Catherine to a dressmaker, and sits in on the fitting. “‘How lovely you look!’” she says to Catherine (34–35). Firbank carefully portrays the sensual side of their relation. “Catherine had been happy. She had felt as if she were in love with Lady Mary.” The relationship “was like a very long succession of touches” (32). In Inclinations, the relation between Lady Mary and Catherine is the most physically erotic relationship in the novel, and it is the most sensualist.<|endoftext|>\n\nPliny The Elder Car Seat Cover By Go Seat Covers\n\n[CS-SCLINEDEPLINYTHEELE] $74.99\n\nProduct Description The best seat cover on the market, the Go Seat Covers Pliny The Elder design for the car seat.

Nauert said the US had not been able to determine “which individuals or entities were responsible for these attacks.” But she said the move was “not a definitive response to the attacks,” suggesting more actions could be taken against Cuba.

I know that there's a large chunk of the community that follows the series and I really want to give them something to enjoy and appreciate. I'm going to try to be as fair as I can about rating a series, and I'll even include the manga to show just how different the two media can be. To start off, we're going to talk about one of the biggest names in the business: Dragon Ball Z.\n\n\n\nI'm a big fan of Dragon Ball Z, and it's not just because it's popular. I just find it a lot of fun and quite amusing to watch. I started reading the manga when I was 11 years old, and watched the show when it came out in America. I even have a few friends who say that DBZ is the reason that they got into anime and manga in the first place. I can understand where they're coming from; Dragon Ball Z is quite the show. It's a very entertaining and quite unique story that you don't see very often.\n\n\n\nDragon Ball Z (DBZ) is a sequel to the original Dragon Ball manga. The Dragon Ball manga was created by Akira Toriyama and ran from 1984 to 1995, having 42 volumes. The manga ran for such a long time, that the time-skip in the anime was only about three years. This gave Toriyama a chance to re-work some of the characters and re-introduce some of the Z-Warriors.\n\n\n\nDragon Ball Z is one of the most successful anime in history, but it had a very weird start. It started out as a continuation of the original Dragon Ball series, but the series creators decided to change the main character from Goku to the evil Goku clone named Son Goku (Vegeta's son), so they could take the series in a darker direction. Since the series started out as a comedy, a lot of people weren't really sure what to think of the series.\n\n\n\nDragon Ball Z was a huge hit in America, but the whole thing with Goku being replaced by the more dastardly son did confuse people. There were a lot of people who wanted to know what happened to the hero that they loved. Dragon Ball Z was never as popular in Japan as it was in America. A lot of people in Japan didn't know how to react to the series, and didn't like the fact that Goku wasn't the main character. The series was a hit in the US, but it didn't do very well in Japan.\n\n\n\nWhen the second season of the anime was released, the Japanese fans decided to boycott the show, so the series wasn't very popular. This caused Dragon Ball Z to be cancelled after only two seasons, leaving the fans and anime watchers in the US with a lot of questions. Toriyama would later re-visit the series and give the fans some of the answers, but it took a while.\n\n\n\nThe first Dragon Ball Z movie was released in Japan in March of 1990. This movie would later be released in America under the name of \"Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone\". Toriyama created a new story that would show the fans what happened after the series ended. This is where the first movie leaves off. It isn't until the fourth movie, that Toriyama takes the fans back to the original manga storyline. This is where the series continues to be played out.\n\n\n\nThe second movie, \"Super Saiyan Son Goku\", picks up where the last movie left off. It then goes on to show the events of the first part of the Buu Saga. The third movie, \"Super Saiyan Son Gohan\", is about Gohan's return to the series after he was \"killed\" in the Majin Buu Saga. The fourth movie, \"The World's Strongest\", picks up with the events of the Cell Saga and ends with the \"Freeza\" saga.\n\n\n\nThe fifth and sixth movies go over the Androids Saga. The first movie shows Androids #17 and #18 in action, while the second movie shows the rest of the Androids in action. The seventh movie, \"Super Saiyan Trunks\", covers the Cell Games. The eighth movie, \"Super Saiyan 3 Son Goku\", is about the fusion of Goku and Vegeta to form Vegito. The ninth movie, \"Burn Up! A Red-Hot, Raging, Super-Fierce Fight\" covers the Majin Buu Saga. The tenth movie, \"A New Hero is Born\", shows the events of the Majin Buu Saga in a different light.\n\n\n\nThe eleventh movie, \"Bardock - The Father of Goku\", takes us back in time to the beginning of the Saiyans' attack on the planet earth. This movie fills in a lot of the gaps that Toriyama left out in the original series. The twelfth movie, \"The Battle of Gods\", covers the events of the Battle of Gods. The thirteenth movie, \"Bojack Unbound\", is about the events of Bojack, and shows how he was able to escape from the prison that he was in. The fourteenth movie, \"The History of Trunks\", shows the events of the \"Trunks\" story arc.\n\n\n\nThe fifteenth movie, \"Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan\", shows the events of the original Broly movie. The sixteenth movie, \"Broly - Second Coming\", is a re-hash of the original Broly movie. The seventeenth movie, \"Bio-Broly\", is a re-hash of the original Bio-Broly movie. The eighteenth movie, \"Bojack Unbound\", is a re-hash of the original Bojack movie. The nineteenth movie, \"Bojack Unbound\", is a re-hash of the original Bojack movie. The twentieth movie, \"Cooler's Revenge\", is a re-hash of the original Cooler movie.\n\n\n\nThe twenty-first movie, \"The World's Strongest\", is a re-hash of the original movie, \"The World's Strongest\". The twenty-second movie, \"Dead Zone\", is a re-hash of the original movie, \"Dead Zone\". The twenty-third movie, \"The Tree of Might\", is a re-hash of the original movie, \"The Tree of Might\". The twenty-fourth movie, \"Lord Slug\", is a re-hash of the original movie, \"Lord Slug\". The twenty-fifth movie, \"Cooler's Revenge\", is a re-hash of the original movie, \"Cooler's Revenge\".\n\n\n\nThe twenty-sixth movie, \"The Return of Cooler\", is a re-hash of the original movie, \"The Return of Cooler\". The twenty-seventh movie, \"Super Android 13\", is a re-hash of the original movie, \"Super Android 13\". The twenty-eighth movie, \"Broly - Second Coming\", is a re-hash of the original movie, \"Broly - Second Coming\".

"The $5.1 billion Formula 1 circuit that has divided Miami-Dade’s political elite for years is not dead yet.\n\nA lawsuit against the property’s developer, California billionaire Tilman Fertitta, and the City of Homestead will be heard by an appellate court later this year.\n\nThough a judge earlier this year ruled the property must remain as a speedway until the suit is resolved, developer Fertitta and the City of Homestead say the judgment was made in error and they’re pushing back.\n\n“This has been one of the most complicated and complicated transactions in all of Miami-Dade County,” Homestead Mayor Jeff Porter said. “But it will be an even bigger deal to win on appeal.”\n\nRelated story: Developer plans major changes to Miami Formula 1 track\n\nDeveloper Fertitta and city officials say they are planning a major overhaul of the circuit and want to redevelop some of the land as shops and restaurants.\n\n“It would be a shame if we had to kill the golden goose because some activist attorney out there wants to force us to do something we don’t want to do,” Fertitta said.\n\nOpponents of the circuit, however, say the appeal is just a step in Fertitta’s plan to keep the track from reopening.\n\n“They’ve spent more money to keep it closed than the value of the property is,” said Michael Anderson, a former Homestead City Council member. “They just keep filing motions and filing motions. It’s absurd.”\n\nThe circuit was built with great fanfare in 2009, but ran for just two seasons and closed in 2011. The recession and a worldwide slump in racing attendance hurt the circuit. It also faced stiff competition from the $4.6 billion Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.\n\nRelated story: Report: Miami F1 track in $100 million hole\n\nThough the circuit never made money, city officials say it will still be economically beneficial.\n\n“The track will open,” said Homestead Mayor Jeff Porter. “I’ve been very public on this. The question is what’s the best use of the property. And the best use is for a motorsports park.”\n\nThe circuit had several potential uses. It was discussed as a possible casino site and would also have made a good venue for large-scale entertainment concerts. But Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez and a handful of local lawmakers wanted it to become an international auto racing track.\n\nThe county agreed to buy the property for $13.1 million to give Fertitta control over the facility.\n\nRelated story: Miami racetrack too costly to operate: F1\n\nLast year, Fertitta filed for bankruptcy, claiming the property was costing him too much money to maintain. The bankruptcy filing put a halt to the foreclosure process that was started by a lender, Kowaliga Country Club, after it claimed Fertitta failed to make good on a $13.5 million loan. The foreclosure process was halted when a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Fertitta.\n\nJudge Michael Moore ruled that the property must be held as a racetrack until the bankruptcy proceedings are concluded. That could take years, since Fertitta and Homestead have said they plan to appeal the judge’s decision.<|endoftext|>Maryland DMV - Driver Licensing, Registration, and Car Services\n\nFind information about Driver Licensing, Registration, and Car Services in Maryland including services such as:\n\nDriver Licensing - Commercial Driver License Information,\n\nRoad Tests, and Driver License Services.\n\nIn Maryland, the Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration (MDOT MVA) manages the following:\n\nLicense to drive,\n\nVehicle registration,\n\nTraffic laws and regulations,\n\nVehicle inspections, and\n\nTraffic crash investigations.\n\nWe will provide you with information on applying for a driver's license and the process to register a vehicle.

Jean-luc godard's breathless, one of the most influential movies in the history of cinema, first came to the united states in 1963 as a midnight movie at the morris moore movie theater in new york's village. List of breathless characters is a list of characters in the 1960 film, breathless in order of appearance (click to sort) main characters main characters michel gallois - the man accused of murder jean-paul belmondo - the man on the run. During the 1960s, jean-luc godard was known for using subversive techniques such as jump-cutting and placing characters within illogical and metaphorical scenarios in his films the success of these stylistic techniques and his political stances often overshadowed the commercial success of his movies.\n\nBreathless (french: a bout de souffle) is a 1960 french film written and directed by jean-luc godard the film was inspired by the us american film noir genre, and is now considered a classic example of the french new wave movement. Like hitchcock, godard’s films were known for their thrill and this was arguably the film that launched the french new wave movement with its semi-improvised, almost documentary style this influenced many other filmmakers around the world. Breathless (1960) synopsis breathless is a film about an american criminal named michel who is on the run in paris after killing an oafish american tourist in the process of trying to avoid the police, michel picks up a prostitute named.\n\nJean-luc godard, was one of the forefathers of the french new wave cinema in 1963, godard was the director of one of the most influential movies of the 20th century, breathless (a bout de souffle. If the ending of a bout de souffle seems like a random blip, in the movie itself, it doesn't come across that way godard is clearly building to something. A bout de souffle (english title: breathless) is a french new wave film released in 1960 the plot follows a criminal on the run who tries to find refuge in the house of a beautiful and mysterious woman.\n\nThe man in question is jean-paul belmondo, godard’s frequent collaborator, an italian-american actor who’d make his first appearance on screen as the male lead in 1959’s fanny o’capet, but who, with breathless, would make his name as one of the original french new wave stars and would go on to star in godard’s 1963. Just as godard’s appropriation of classical technique is one of the defining features of a bout de souffle, the film’s very dialogue is a precursor to the type of free-flowing, often aimless chatter that was at the heart of the french new wave. A bout de souffle (breathless), starring jean-paul belmondo and directed by jean-luc godard, defined the spirit of the french new wave movement, capturing a world of empty young people, more interested in pursuing personal relationships and artistic creativity than in the concerns of the world.\n\nA bout de souffle: a beat-the-clock breathless breathless, directed by jean-luc godard, is one of the most influential and innovative films of the twentieth century the film is a melange of genres - a crime story, a romance, and a heist film all at once. A bout de souffle is a french film directed by jean-luc godard, released in 1960, which in turn influenced other directors and films, notably the filmmaker terrence malick, who cites it as an inspiration for the film badlands.

Housing manages more than 200 unused properties, most of them acquired in recent years.\n\nIt makes sense to invite the province to take on a social-housing role.\n\nBut what about a better idea: invite all municipalities to take ownership of these properties and manage them with an eye to developing them for nonmarket rentals.\n\nThat way, mayors and councillors can at least take credit for moving forward on a key social issue.\n\nThey can point to a series of successes, in other words.\n\nIn Vancouver, where Mayor Gregor Robertson has proclaimed that homelessness is an issue of \"public safety\" and that the city is doing everything it can to solve the problem, it could result in a genuine breakthrough.\n\nAs long as the mayor can't get his mind around the idea of the city owning and developing social housing, Vancouver will continue to lag behind many North American cities that have embraced social housing.\n\nBut that's a political reality that will not change as long as the Vision Vancouver party controls the mayor's office and council.\n\nFor the record, I'm not naive about the obstacles that exist in Vancouver and other B.C. municipalities.\n\nThe economics of redevelopment make it extremely difficult for cities to generate the capital necessary to finance social-housing projects.\n\nHousing authorities, meanwhile, face the same financial and political constraints as other government agencies.\n\nThe B.C. government has no money to help with the costs of new social housing, though its minister responsible for housing has pledged to meet with housing activists.\n\nPremier Christy Clark is totally disinterested in the plight of the homeless.\n\nAs a consequence, politicians don't even talk about the idea of taking control of B.C. Housing properties and developing them for nonmarket rentals.\n\nAll that makes a lot of sense, but that doesn't mean it isn't the best option available.\n\nThe province could always decide to sell the properties if it determines that it can't manage them for social purposes.\n\nThat would be one way to meet the immediate demands of homelessness.\n\nThe B.C. government could also get involved by making them available for nonmarket rentals to senior levels of government, as has occurred with a number of Canadian Forces bases.\n\nGiven the costs of maintaining B.C. Housing properties, it could be financially viable for the province to use them as an investment fund for nonmarket rentals.\n\nWith the federal government unwilling to provide money for new social housing, cities should at least be allowed to take advantage of the empty properties that the province is now sitting on.\n\nHere's a twist that might appeal to Robertson and Vancouver council.\n\nImagine if it's made clear to Robertson and Vision Vancouver councillors that their role is to approve developments that don't displace low-income residents.\n\nThat would certainly be an incentive to do something to ease homelessness.\n\nIf the province and the city take responsibility for the two million square feet of B.C. Housing property, that could be a major step forward for both housing and homelessness.\n\nAnd it could be done with minimal investment by both levels of government.\n\nI realize that's not going to happen, but it's an idea worth raising for discussion.<|endoftext|>Share Pinterest\n\nEmail\n\nLet's try to clear something up once and for all: No, the Mercedes-AMG C63 is not underpowered, or too expensive, or a step down from the C63 S. It's simply the C63 you buy if you aren't all that interested in hard driving. It's still an excellent sports sedan, but it's not a monster.\n\nThink of the C63 as the love child of a Honda Accord and a Porsche 911. That's a weird sentence, but it sums up this car perfectly: This is an old-school luxury sedan that can go around corners but would be just as happy plowing through rainstorms as getting down on a dance floor. It has an engine that you would expect in a performance car but can also be ordered with a seven-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWe spent a week with the 2017 Mercedes-AMG C63 S Coupe (and believe us, we were just as confused by that name as you are) and the one thing we know for sure is that this car makes us smile. It's not a high-strung, fuel-frugal rocket. It's just a car that makes us happy to be driving.\n\n\"It's a sedan!\" you might say. \"You're not supposed to like it!\"\n\nReally? Let's try this: Remember the BMW M5? That super-sedan that offered everything from a 500-hp twin-turbo inline six to a 5.0-liter V8 to a 7.0-liter V12? Sure, they all had monstrous power, but none of them made us smile.\n\nThis AMG makes us smile.\n\nThis is the same basic engine that was offered in the C63 S, but the C63 uses the Mercedes-AMG 4.0-liter V8 that makes 469 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque, whereas the C63 S uses the hand-built AMG 4.0-liter V8 that has two turbochargers and is rated at 503 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque.\n\nThat's still plenty for most of us, but it also means that the C63 is heavier and a little slower. The coupe we tested had a seven-speed automatic transmission, which is a shame, but we're happy to report that the eight-speed transmission in the sedan is still a very good gearbox, with quick, precise shifts.\n\nThe engine has the old-school AMG whine to it, but there's no shortage of low-end torque, and it's so smooth that we didn't have to shift much during our test drive. All of this made for plenty of smiles, even though we can't say we would be in a hurry to buy the car if we had a family. With an EPA rating of 17 mpg city and 24 mpg highway, it's the thirstiest member of the AMG family.\n\n\"It's so smooth that we didn't have to shift much during our test drive.\"\n\nThat's because the suspension in the C63 isn't tuned for serious cornering. It's too soft. It was so soft, in fact, that we thought we had accidentally picked up a C43 Coupe.\n\nIt's great for cruising on a Sunday morning, and the grip is there for high-speed cornering if you want it, but the suspension setup feels like it's more interested in keeping the car's occupants comfy and the ride quiet than it is in hard driving.\n\nThe C63 Coupe we tested had the Performance Package, which adds bigger wheels and tires, more aggressive suspension tuning and improved steering, but it was still too soft for us. The only people we can see who might be interested in the C63 Coupe are those who want to make it more like the C63 S.\n\n\"The only people we can see who might be interested in the C63 Coupe are those who want to make it more like the C63 S.\"\n\nSo the coupe was a bit disappointing, but the sedan is a very impressive car. It's not as fast as the C63"

Two-time Emmy winner, Jayne Trcka, an instructor in Oregon State’s College of Public Health and Human Sciences and a professor in the College of Agricultural Sciences, has spent the last five years attempting to figure out a better way to harvest soybeans in Asia.\n\nTwo-time Emmy winner Jayne Trcka and OSU undergraduates Jeremy Williams and Andrew O’Shaughnessy (left to right) spend time with farmers in China and Vietnam. Photos courtesy of Jayne Trcka\n\nWith the production of soybean meal in China and Vietnam expected to increase 70 percent by 2020, Trcka’s task is daunting. It means she must figure out how to collect and use all of the soybeans and use them to help impoverished people in those countries.\n\n“There’s a lot of waste from soybean harvesting,” Trcka says. “Right now, most of the waste is burned. If you burn it, you create air pollution. But we’re also looking at creating a more sustainable, cleaner crop.”\n\nTo that end, Trcka, who holds an Oregon State master’s degree in human nutrition, was awarded a $450,000, five-year grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to study alternative uses for soybean harvest waste. Her work was recently featured on the OSU Research & Discover magazine Web site, http://researchdiscover.oregonstate.edu/archive/soybean-waste.\n\n“Soybean waste is actually a very valuable crop nutrient,” Trcka says. “In the United States, we just burn it, but in Asia, they actually use it as a nutrient for their crops. There are tremendous opportunities to use it as a food supplement or fertilizer. We’re trying to find the best way to harvest and process it.”\n\nTrcka is a professor of food science and human nutrition. Her project will involve a multi-disciplinary effort, including undergraduate and graduate students, and a team of researchers from Oregon State, Washington State, the University of Washington, Cornell University and the University of Illinois.\n\n“Part of this research is going to include Oregon State students,” Trcka says. “We’re going to look at the use of soybean waste in Vietnamese and Chinese diets, and how we can get more value from the waste. We’re also looking at developing a better process for collection.”\n\nThat process, Trcka says, would include how to make better use of the soybean waste through some type of fermentation process.\n\n“What we’re doing is providing food security, and also helping to reduce pollution,” she says. “And we’re helping farmers grow crops that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly.”\n\nContact:\n\nJayne Trcka, 541-737-7160, jayne@cohn.oregonstate.edu<|endoftext|>WOW!!! 2 BEDROOM WATERFRONT HOME WITH DIRECT LAKE ACCESS.

First, the bike is somewhat unique in the market. Not only is it the smallest and most nimble of all the bikes it’s pitted against (Honda CBR650F, Kawasaki Ninja 650, Suzuki GSX-S750, and KTM 690 Duke), it’s also probably the least expensive bike in the comparison. And that’s just the beginning of the story.\n\nAfter riding this bike for a month, it’s clear that there’s a pretty unique market for this bike. First, this is a bike for the younger crowd. This is not a bike for anyone over 30. It’s too small and low-slung and while the seat height is good (the same as a KTM 690 Duke), it’s still too small for someone our age to really enjoy. But that’s not the main reason why this bike is a niche bike.\n\nThe main reason is the lack of displacement. The FZ-07 makes just 113 horsepower. Even the Honda CBR650F, the least powerful bike in the comparison, makes 13 more ponies than the FZ-07. So it’s not so much the bike is underpowered, it’s just not as powerful as the other bikes in the comparison. But, as we’ve already learned, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThe FZ-07’s purpose isn’t to take you on the highway at speeds of 80 mph or even take you to the local Starbucks. This bike is about the fun you have on a twisty road, not the highway. And while it’s fun to take to the highway and carve the corners at 80 mph, this is a bike that really thrives on the twisty roads.\n\nThis is the smallest bike in the comparison and the one that is easiest to chuck into corners and weave through traffic. The narrow seat and low seat height make it a great option for a newer rider. This is an easy motorcycle to just jump on and ride.\n\nThe bike is super nimble and eager to turn. That makes it a great choice for someone looking for something a little more agile than a standard middleweight bike. But, to be honest, the FZ-07 really felt like the perfect size for us. We can’t imagine anyone who would fit this bike and not really enjoy it.\n\nOn the power side of things, the FZ-07 has a sort of pseudo-Twin character. While the engine is definitely not a Twin, the throttle response and overall power character of the bike are very Twin-like.\n\nIt’s an easy throttle and it always feels like the power comes on pretty hard. This makes the bike a fun bike to ride. But, it also makes the bike a pretty easy one to over-rev. It’s pretty easy to wind it up and get it to the limiter. But that’s part of what we enjoy about the bike. It’s sort of like the FZ-09, but smaller.\n\nOn the FZ-07, you get a bunch of engine power to help you go fast and a bike that’s not nearly as intimidating as the FZ-09. The power delivery feels almost like a smaller, less-intimidating version of the FZ-09.\n\nFor a rider who isn’t looking to go incredibly fast, but who enjoys a little excitement, the FZ-07 is the perfect bike. And the bike is fun. Not only is it fun to ride, but it’s also a pretty practical option for a lot of people. It’s small enough to maneuver through the urban jungle, but it’s big enough that the rider will feel comfortable and not like they’re on a child’s toy.\n\nWhile we’re not saying that this bike is a child’s toy, we will say that it’s a pretty easy bike to throw around. And the bike is probably the one that we’d recommend for the casual rider looking for a good, fun, sporty motorcycle.\n\nNow, there are some things that we don’t like about this bike. And they’re mostly the same things we didn’t like about"
"Dwyane Wade apparently went to bed early and slept through the Miami Heat’s loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday.\n\n“I missed it?” he asked. “Why?”\n\nBecause the Heat are playing terrible basketball, he was told.\n\nDigital Access For Only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.\n\n“Oh, they are,” Wade said. “Well, they had their shots to win the game. We didn’t come out and make shots. We had a lot of opportunities to make plays and didn’t make them. It’s like that sometimes.”\n\nThe Heat has lost eight of its last 11 games and eight in a row at home, where it will be for four of its next five games. This is the first time Miami has lost eight in a row at home since the 2007-08 season, the last time Wade played with Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nSHARE COPY LINK Dwyane Wade scored 18 points in the Miami Heat's 103-91 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. March 18, 2016. Video by Manny Navarro\n\n“It’s never a concern,” Wade said of losing eight in a row at home. “I mean, if it goes on and on, then it becomes a concern. But for us, we’re at a point right now where we have to figure some things out.”\n\nAfter a furious start, Miami trailed by as many as 19 points and lost to the NBA’s second worst team by two. The Heat is now a game under .500 (23-24) and barely holding onto the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nIt is the first time Miami has been a game under .500 since March 11, 2009.\n\nMiami shot 38.2 percent from the field and was 6 of 20 on threes. The Heat scored 17 points in the first quarter and finished with 91, the fewest since the 1993-94 season.\n\n“It was a poor performance by us,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “You have to compete in this league.”\n\nHere are our five takeaways from the Heat’s loss:\n\nNo adjustment\n\nIt is amazing that the Heat hasn’t figured out that Hassan Whiteside has to play in the second half if the team wants to win. Whiteside has to play in the second half, even when he’s not scoring or having a big impact, to at least give Miami a chance. Whiteside has been so bad offensively the last two games, you’d think Spoelstra would adjust his second-half rotation to at least put Whiteside on the court for the entire fourth quarter. But he didn’t. The Heat played one of its worst offensive halves of the season in the second half Friday and Whiteside watched the game from the bench, where he sat for the last seven minutes. Whiteside has played the fourth quarter in each of the last three games and in the loss to the Memphis Grizzlies he scored three points on 1-of-6 shooting and grabbed one rebound. The Grizzlies outscored the Heat by 13 in the second half and Wade was the only player who made an impact offensively in the fourth. He scored 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting.\n\nBackup big man\n\nMichael Beasley had one of the best games of his career Friday, scoring 23 points on 9-of-13 shooting and grabbing five rebounds. Beasley is one of Miami’s better shooters, but he’s only averaging 6.5 points per game. He hasn’t been a significant contributor this season.\n\n▪ What’s going on with Beasley?\n\n▪ What does Michael Beasley have to do to earn more minutes?\n\nCan’t hit a shot\n\nThe Heat’s field goal percentage has dropped each of the last four games, from 51.9 percent to 47.2 percent. In this eight-game losing streak, Miami is shooting 43.8 percent from the field and 29.4 percent from three.\n\n“It’s tough,” Goran Dragic said. “We didn’t make a lot of shots. It’s not like we can blame the game on that. We played good defense. We were trying to come back in the game. We just didn’t have a lot of open shots.”\n\nMaintaining possessions\n\nMiami has one of the worst offensive ratings in the league. It is only 24th in the NBA in fast-break points per game. Miami got very little out of its guards in transition Friday, scoring just six points in transition. Goran Dragic led the Heat with two fast-break points.\n\nThe Heat is in a bit of a transition period with Dwyane Wade leaving. It is in a search of a new identity. But if it can get good, efficient production out of its young guards, it could get off to a good start. But that didn’t happen Friday.\n\nYou have to make shots\n\nEven if the Heat isn’t making shots, it needs to shoot the ball better. The Heat was just 6 of 20 on threes and its shooting percentage dropped below 30 percent. If Miami is going to have any chance at getting a shot to make the playoffs, it has to find a way to improve its field goal percentage.<|endoftext|>Start 'Em & Sit 'Em is the ultimate look at the weekly NFL matchups and how they'll affect your fantasy football team. All starts and sits are based on standard scoring leagues. Obvious fantasy starters like Cam Newton and Antonio Brown will not be featured. For your final lineup decisions, check our lineup rankings.\n\nSelect An Option... Quarterbacks Running Backs Wide Receivers Tight Ends Defense Kickers\n\nByes: Browns, Chiefs, Lions, Packers\n\nStart 'Em vs. Start of the Week - Aaron Rodgers vs. Tennessee Titans Rodgers has put up at least 25.8 fantasy points in all but one game this season, and he's been a top-five fantasy option in five of his last six starts. This week, he faces a Titans defense that has allowed two touchdown passes and one QB to throw for more than 300 yards in four of its last five games. vs. Andy Dalton vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Dalton has been on a roll of late, scoring at least 24 fantasy points in four of his last five games. He's also thrown multiple touchdown passes in four of his last five contests. A favorable matchup against the Buccaneers awaits this week, and this franchise has allowed an average of almost 22 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks on the road. vs. Kirk Cousins vs. San Francisco 49ers Cousins and the Redskins head into a Week 11 matchup against a 49ers team that has allowed at least 19 fantasy points to every quarterback it has faced this season. Cousins has averaged 23.5 fantasy points in his last three starts, and this game has the makings of a shootout between two of the NFC's top teams. vs. Derek Carr vs. Green Bay Packers Carr has been underwhelming in recent weeks, scoring a combined 25.1 fantasy points in his last two games. A road matchup against the Packers doesn't appear to be an easy one on paper, but Green Bay has allowed two or more touchdown passes to five of seven quarterbacks they've faced. vs. Ryan Tannehill vs. New York Jets Tannehill has posted solid numbers in recent weeks, scoring 17-plus fantasy points in four of his last five games. A matchup against the Jets this week sets him up to be a low-end QB1 or solid streaming option. New York has allowed two or more touchdown passes to six of eight quarterbacks they've faced on the road. Sleepers:\n\nMarcus Mariota at GB, Tyrod Taylor at DET\n\nSit 'Em vs. Sit of the Week - Matt Ryan vs. Seattle Seahawks Ryan has been fantasy's most popular start at quarterback over the past three weeks, but a tough matchup against the Seahawks makes him a serious risk this weekend. In fact, Seattle has allowed just one QB (Russell Wilson) to throw for more than 300 yards against them. Ryan is best suited for a QB2 slot. vs. Joe Flacco vs. Houston Texans Flacco has put up big fantasy numbers in his last two starts, but this week's matchup in Houston makes him a risky option. The Texans have allowed just one touchdown pass and have an overall stingy defense, making this a game where I'd avoid the Ravens signal-caller. vs. Marcus Mariota vs. Green Bay Packers Mariota has been on fire of late, scoring at least 22.3 fantasy points in five straight games. But a matchup in Green Bay against the Packers makes him a difficult fantasy option. Aaron Rodgers and this unit have been tough on quarterbacks at Lambeau Field, allowing a combined eight touchdown passes in seven games. vs. Derek Carr vs. Washington Redskins Carr is coming off his best fantasy performance of the season, scoring 22.4 points against the Chargers last week. I'd avoid him, though, in a road matchup against the Redskins. In seven games, this unit has allowed just two touchdown passes and the second-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. vs. Eli Manning vs. Buffalo Bills Eli and the Giants face a Bills defense that has allowed the fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, including just two touchdown passes in seven games. Manning has also averaged 13.4 points over his last four games, so he's not a great option for fantasy owners. Busts:\n\nMatt Ryan vs. SEA, Blake Bortles at CLE\n\nMichael Fabiano is an"
"While the true identity of the picture of a dog wearing a baseball cap, trying to peer over a high fence at a tennis court has not yet been confirmed, a good story has been shared across the internet. According to the Huffington Post, a man named Michael at a Las Vegas community association, who goes by the username Lionhart28 on Reddit, says he and his dog Storm, seen in the picture, are both avid tennis players.\n\nMichael says he got Storm in June 2013, after he'd had a lot of difficulty finding the right puppy, and claims the dog has a \"massive personality and plays with just about every dog she meets,\" according to the Huffington Post.\n\nStorm, a little over a year old, is a high-energy dog that loves to run, as Michael says. Storm is also \"hyper,\" according to the Daily Mail.\n\nMichael says Storm often goes for runs with him, but that sometimes Storm becomes \"too rambunctious\" and causes trouble.\n\nStorm had been in one of these \"troublemaking moods\" on Wednesday when Michael was playing tennis. He brought the dog with him to the tennis courts, but when she saw a dog playing tennis in the park, she tried to bolt for it.\n\nMichael was able to grab her collar, but the next thing he knew, he saw the picture, which he called \"kind of crazy.\"\n\nAt first Michael thought the picture was \"cool,\" but later he said it felt like he was \"showing off\" his dog.\n\nThis may or may not be the actual identity of the picture, but Storm is a tennis-loving dog with an almost otherworldly ability to jump. Her personality, according to the Daily Mail, is also described as \"full of life,\" and she likes to run and chase tennis balls.\n\nStorm also loves Michael, and he says he couldn't have asked for a better dog.<|endoftext|>Aloha, Hawaii! You're the first state in the union, the 49th state and oh, yeah, the one that's had a fight going on for years about whether to allow GMOs to be grown on the islands.\n\nBut first things first, to the rest of the world Hawaii is known for its pineapples and beaches, but you should also know that the Hawaiian culture is steeped in aloha (love, compassion and joy). When I was a kid and got sick, my mom would bring me aloha soup. She made a big pot of it and brought it to me in bed. It was chicken soup, but it wasn't so much the chicken that I loved but the love.\n\nI felt better.\n\nLove isn't a panacea, but it can go a long way toward healing. If you're an herb lover you know that the first thing most physicians did when they couldn't fix an ailment was to send you to a local wise woman. If your plants are failing, it's likely that the problem is some kind of nutrient deficiency or toxicity, so the first thing you should do is give them love.\n\nHow to give them love? Plant them right, keep them growing at their best and follow the wisdom of gardening. (Wisdom is a hard thing to quantify, but often it can be summarized in some simple phrase or teaching.)\n\nPlant them right\n\nWhen it comes to planting, give your plants plenty of space to stretch their roots. Yes, that means you'll need more pots, but that's why the gardener in Hawaii, and elsewhere, was (and is) paid so well. It takes many days to plant one pineapple or banana tree. With plants that take a while to grow, plant your seeds far enough apart that each seedling will be able to grow big and strong. With smaller plants that don't grow to be tall trees or vines, you can plant them close enough to share their roots and feed off of each other.\n\nYou might be familiar with the practice of placing a stake next to each new plant, holding a length of twine and running it between the stakes to create a trellis. In some areas of Hawaii this is called the Hawaiian strawberry fence.\n\nGive your plants plenty of water. During the dry season they will need water at least once a week. If you're fortunate enough to live in an area where you get rain, that's not enough water. When it comes to watering your plants, think \"deep watering.\" Water your plants slowly over an hour and water them at the same time each day. This ensures that the roots get plenty of water and that the salts that have leached out of the soil are washed away.\n\nYou can make a rain gauge out of an old container (like a gallon milk jug) and a stick to mark the water level. Place it at the top of the container, hold the stick in place, turn it upside down and make your mark on the side. Repeat this once a week and you'll know how much water your garden gets.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are some native Hawaiian plants that grow under rocks on mountainsides and that only get rainwater. One of these is the Hawaiian red fern, which is an invasive and does well in rainy zones. In other words, it's one of the plants that will grow best in wet zones.\n\nIf you're looking for a plant that requires minimal care, you can try the kalo (taro). A member of the Araceae family, it grows best in wet zones. This is the staple food of Hawaii and its watery and starchy roots are eaten and made into poi, which is the traditional Hawaiian dish. You can also wrap the cooked roots around meat and it's considered a healthy way to eat your meat. The starchy leaves are eaten too. They are steamed or boiled and eaten as a vegetable.\n\nThis isn't a plant that needs a lot of fertilizer or extra water. It also takes a long time to grow.\n\nIf you're planting an area where it gets warm, you can try the century plant, which is also called agave or maguey. This member of the Asparagus family grows fast and will need lots of water to keep it happy and thriving.\n\nKeep them growing at their best\n\nIn the garden, love is all about care and tending. Give your plants lots of water, but not too much. Every time you fertilize a plant, remember that the fertilizer will run out. When it does, the soil will need to be remineralized. Adding the right fertilizer is important to keeping the plants growing at their best.\n\nFertilize the plants at the same time each week. In Hawaii, this is called the \"Rule of Sevens.\" So, when you're adding the fertilizer, fertilize the plants on Sunday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\nFertilize your plants to promote big root systems. If your plants have well-developed roots, they'll be able to get water, fertilizer and minerals and to push out a healthy harvest. You can fertilize your plants with fish emulsion and water or bone meal and water. It's a good idea to make a mix and apply it on a weekly basis, following the Rule of Sevens. (To mix your own, follow these instructions.)\n\nIn Hawaii, gardening is a constant battle against parasites and disease. These threats to your plants' health will affect their production. A good way to protect your plants from pests and disease is to cover them with floating row covers. Row covers will protect your plants from insects, parasites and wind. They will also keep your plants warm at night. They're especially helpful for plants that need lots of sunlight. You'll know they're getting enough light if they're flowering.\n\nFruit is not the only way that you can tell that your plants are thriving. You can grow veggies too. You can plant squash, onions and other vegetables that will thrive in hot zones.\n\nFollow the wisdom of gardening\n\nGardening is an art form. It's also an old tradition. I've always found that the best advice on gardening is the simplest. Give your plants the love they need and follow the wisdom of gardening. That means to plant them right, give them lots of water, fertilize them, watch out for parasites and disease and give them a break when it's cold outside.\n\nA great resource for Hawaiian gardeners is Growing Hawaiian Plants. The book, written by Cyndi Crawford, is a collection of interviews with 10 experts in Hawaiian plant conservation. The interviews are illustrated with historical images. If you're looking for more inspiration, take a look at David Trigg's TED talk on how to grow the world's most perfect fruit.\n\nResources<|endoftext|>I am not sure where to post this so here is hoping it is okay for this section, but I am about to make a cake and I know nothing about it and I am so excited!\n\nSo I am making a cake for my friend's 21st birthday party, and I am making it in the shape of an ice cream cone with a chocolate cake and strawberry filling. I need some advice though because I have never done anything like this before!\n\nI would like to put white chocolate chips on the cone, and I was thinking of doing white chocolate mixed with green food colouring, to match the cake decor (i.e. white chocolate to make the 'chocolate', green food colouring to make it the 'mint' colour), but I am not sure if that will be okay!

The small bar was full of smoke and packed with about 20 people, mostly young men in their late teens and early twenties. The pub, near a notorious housing estate, had been recommended by a local resident as a good place to meet a white supremacist, a man who goes by the nom de plume of H finbar and who claims to have been in the British National Party (BNP) for about 15 years.\n\nI was following in the footsteps of David Berridge, a social psychologist at Oxford University, who conducted a controversial experiment to test how far racial prejudice could be reduced. Berridge selected 12 men from the BNP and told them that he was developing a computer game in which they would play the part of a house-buyer and have to make decisions on the best place to live. Berridge altered the outcomes of their choices to make it appear as if the men were rejecting homes in areas with high proportions of ethnic minorities.\n\nWhen they were told that their choices would result in them ending up in a house in a predominantly ethnic-minority neighbourhood, the men \"didn't bat an eyelid\", Berridge said. The research found that the men had strong, negative feelings towards ethnic minorities and some of them were, according to Berridge, \"as extreme as any I've seen\".\n\n\"You could see it in their eyes and the way they reacted,\" he said. \"They really believed that they were right and everyone else was wrong.\" Berridge had expected to see an initial show of outrage from the men but he was disappointed by the apparent ease with which the racist beliefs were accepted.\n\n\"If I hadn't known what I was looking for, I wouldn't have seen it,\" he said. \"I had to point it out to them. They were very gracious about accepting it.\"\n\nBerridge found that only a few weeks after the training, when they were asked about their attitudes, their beliefs were \"considerably less extreme\". The men had accepted that there was a racial minority living among them, although they continued to harbour negative feelings towards them. The white supremacists didn't completely change their views on immigration, as the results of Berridge's research were controversially revealed on BBC Two's Newsnight in January 2009.\n\nAs a social scientist, I had mixed feelings about the experiment. The men were racist and their beliefs needed to be challenged, but it seemed inappropriate to train them to be less racist. Berridge said that this wasn't the point of his experiment. The aim was to test whether it was possible to reduce the extent of their prejudice. It was important to know the limits of the possible, he said.\n\nAttitudes, whether towards ethnic minorities, women, disabled people, fat people or the rich, influence what we do and how we act towards others. They can manifest themselves in the workplace and in the wider community and, as in Berridge's experiment, they can also be reduced.\n\nOur attitudes are influenced by our experiences, the people we associate with and what we see in the media. If we are surrounded by positive attitudes towards a particular group, we are more likely to develop positive attitudes towards them. If, however, we are surrounded by negative attitudes, we are more likely to share them.\n\nAttitudes can be improved or challenged. Is there a tipping point beyond which attitudes cannot be changed? Or can they be changed by someone without your consent? What can you do to change someone else's attitude?\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines attitudes as \"one's personal view of another or others, especially when based on bias or prejudice\". It is a psychological term that has grown out of social and cultural anthropology. In the early 1970s, it was often used to refer to the combined set of behaviours, body language and non-verbal cues that communicate a person's attitudes to the outside world.\n\nWe use the word \"attitude\" when we discuss our personal beliefs and our views on society and politics. \"What is your attitude to same-sex marriage?\" \"Should a woman be allowed to go topless in public?\" \"How do you feel about the war in Iraq?\" \"Do you support the war on drugs?\" \"What's your attitude to the death penalty?\"\n\n\"The attitude of the work force is a constant source of concern to the management.\" \"The standard of behaviour is all too often lacking, and is a cause for great concern among the general public.\" These are three examples from the Guardian newspaper illustrating how the term has been used. It is a term that captures a feeling about something or someone, as well as the thinking and emotions that lie behind our thoughts and feelings.\n\nWe think that we can infer what a person is thinking from their attitude. The roots of this are contained in the word itself, which comes from the Latin attitudināre, meaning \"to make an attitude or assume an attitude\", from attitudinis, meaning \"of the attitude\". Attitudes can also be unconscious. We might not be aware of our attitudes but they nevertheless influence our behaviour.\n\nWhen we discuss attitudes, we are describing \"a combination of cognition and affect (feeling or emotion)\", according to Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, a social psychologist at Ohio State University in the US. She describes attitudes as an integrated cognitive and affective state that influences how we think about and behave towards other people. Our attitudes, Knobloch-Westerwick says, also influence our values, which are \"enduring beliefs about what is desirable\". Our attitudes and values reflect what is important to us and affect how we respond to the world around us.\n\nPsychologists and social scientists have attempted to determine how attitudes are formed and how they are changed. They have explored whether there is a tipping point beyond which attitudes cannot be changed.\n\nAttitudes can be revealed through the process of attitude measurement. A set of statements is used to assess an attitude. These statements are designed to elicit the respondents' attitudes, and they are commonly called attitude measures. The respondents are asked to agree or disagree with these statements.\n\nThe respondents are likely to change their responses if the statements are modified. Attitude measures often use pairs of statements. One statement in the pair will tend to support a particular view and the other will tend to oppose that view. For example, in the classic attitude measure known as the \"four-point Likert scale\", a series of statements is given and the respondent is asked to pick the one that comes closest to their attitude. The statements are then given in pairs and the respondent is asked to pick which one comes closest to their attitude. This method is also known as the semantic differential technique.\n\nThe best-known attitude measure is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, which was originally developed to test for psychopathology. It consists of statements in which the respondent is asked to choose between two options and pick the one that comes closest to their attitude. Other measures have been developed to measure opinions on a variety of issues, such as gender roles, political and moral opinions, personality characteristics and personality disorders.\n\nOne such measure is the so-called authoritarian scale. This was first developed in 1958 by the US psychologist Bertram Raven. It consists of statements that are asked to assess a respondent's support for a hierarchical and conformist society. In this measure, the respondent is asked to say how much they agree with a series of statements.\n\nOne example is: \"Sometimes other people have ideas that are dangerous and bad for everyone. I have an obligation to put my ideas in the proper place, so people won't get them and follow them.\" Another example is: \"There will always be people who are so lazy and disorderly that they cannot be trusted to have the same rights as others. They should be helped, but they cannot be trusted to do what is best for them.\"\n\nThe statements are also divided into those with a democratic orientation (such as \"Children should be allowed to say anything at all in school\") and those with a non-democratic orientation (such as \"Children should be seen and not heard\"). The measure has been used to assess the authoritarian attitudes of police officers and judges.\n\nAttitude measures have been used to determine the level of support for the political parties. The UK Labour Party, for example, has used them in its efforts to change the public's views.\n\nIn the 1980s, a Labour Party councillor in West Yorkshire, David Blunkett, thought that it would be a"
"A controversial topic among many pet owners and animal rights advocates is whether it’s acceptable to feed dogs or cats with a plant-based diet.\n\nHowever, as more people are becoming aware of the potential for a plant-based diet to benefit their own health, more pet owners are considering vegan options for their pets.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the potential benefits and potential risks of vegan pet diets.\n\nWhat Is A Vegan Diet?\n\nAlthough there are a number of differences between humans and pets, the following are some of the similarities between the way humans and animals use nutrients and protein in their bodies:\n\nHumans and animals both need carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nWe both need vitamins A, C, D, E, and B12 to prevent deficiencies.\n\nWe both need calcium and phosphorous to prevent bone disease.\n\nWe both need amino acids to keep our muscles healthy.\n\nHowever, there are many differences between humans and animals when it comes to food choices. Animals eat all of their food raw. Humans, however, cook their food.\n\nHumans are omnivores, which means we eat a variety of foods. Pets are carnivores, which means they eat raw meat, bones, and organs. This is why we tend to look to animals for examples when it comes to nutrition:\n\nAnimals like dogs and cats thrive on high protein diets.\n\nAnimals don’t eat grains, starchy vegetables, or vegetables high in sugar.\n\nIf you feed a vegan diet to your dog, you’ll feed a diet of plants and plant-based proteins.\n\nHow Can A Vegan Diet Benefit Your Dog?\n\nOne of the major concerns people have about vegan pet diets is the potential for malnutrition.\n\nIf you’ve been feeding your dog the same diet for years and are concerned about a vegan diet, you’ll want to talk to your veterinarian about what options you have to keep your pet healthy and well-nourished.\n\nIs It Better For The Environment?\n\nDogs and cats aren’t the only animals that can benefit from a vegan diet. If you look at the amount of grains and livestock used in our diets, you’ll find that the resources needed to produce that food would be better used to feed the billions of people who are currently starving.\n\nPlant-based diets are more environmentally friendly than animal-based diets, which is why many people who make the switch to veganism feel that it’s a better way to treat our planet.\n\nIs It Healthier?\n\nWhen you look at the way meat is produced, you’ll see that animals are often treated with antibiotics and growth hormones.\n\nWhile this doesn’t pose a risk to humans, it’s certainly not good for the animals.\n\nAccording to a recent article on Modern Farmer, approximately 60 percent of antibiotics used in the United States are used in food-producing animals.\n\nWhen you switch to a plant-based diet, you’re avoiding meat that has been treated with antibiotics and growth hormones.\n\nVegan Pet Diets Are Free Of Toxic Ingredients\n\nJust like humans, pets can be affected by the toxins in their food.\n\nThe World Health Organization has found that processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, and ham, are carcinogenic and are not safe for human consumption.\n\nProcessed meats are potentially just as bad for your pets.\n\nIn addition, feeding a vegan diet can eliminate many toxic foods for your dog, such as grains.\n\nGrains are often genetically modified. The way they’re produced can lead to more allergies, digestive problems, and diseases.\n\nMany pet owners have found that dogs and cats do better on a vegan diet. It’s healthier for the animals, and you can feel good about your choice to do what’s best for the environment.\n\nShould I Feed My Dog A Vegan Diet?\n\nIf you decide to feed your dog a vegan diet, you’ll want to make sure that you’re doing it correctly.\n\nAnimals can survive with fewer nutrients than humans. It’s possible for your pet to get all of the nutrition they need from vegan sources, but it’s also possible for your dog to develop health problems from a vegan diet.\n\nThe most important factor is to make sure you’re getting your dog the right amount of vitamins and nutrients.\n\nIt’s also important to get your dog the right type of plant-based protein. Dogs are carnivores, so their diets should consist of protein from animals.\n\nIf you decide to go vegan for yourself, you should also consider the benefits of a vegan diet for your pets.\n\nDo you want to feed your dog a vegan diet? If so, how do you plan to make sure they get all of the vitamins and nutrients they need?<|endoftext|>Hibiscus Tea, Just For You!\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever wanted a Hibiscus Tea gift basket? We did. So we created one. With a good assortment of Hibiscus Tea. Some of our favorites and some you may have never heard of before. The possibilities of tea are endless and that is why we just can't seem to get enough of it!\n\n\n\nHibiscus tea has been around for centuries, but it wasn't until it began to show up in the United States in the last few decades that it has really become popular. The plant that it comes from is native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. This wonderful and delicious tea was said to be a favorite of Don Carlos, King of Spain, in the 16th Century.\n\n\n\nThe flavor of the tea depends on how it is prepared. There are a few different ways to brew this tea, from its basic form of dried petals, to the more complex methods like a floral infusion.\n\n\n\nYou can make a simple Hibiscus tea by placing 1 tablespoon of dried Hibiscus flowers into a tea infuser and steeping for about five minutes. If you would like a cold version, then you can mix the dried Hibiscus flowers with water and let it steep overnight. Then put the liquid in the refrigerator until it is cold. Another way to enjoy a cold Hibiscus tea is to use a commercial version, such as our Hibiscus Lemonade Tea.\n\n\n\nThere are different ways to make a floral infusion. To make a floral infusion, place 1 tablespoon of dried Hibiscus flowers and 2 cups of hot water into a quart jar. Let it steep for 10-15 minutes and then strain it. Hibiscus tea is delicious on its own, but you can also add a little bit of sugar and lime juice to the infusion.\n\n\n\nThe tea can be consumed either hot or cold. There is no right or wrong way to drink Hibiscus tea. You can make a basic infusion and let it steep overnight, or you can make a more complex floral infusion, or you can just make a basic cold infusion. No matter what your preference, you will find that this tea is quite delicious.\n\nNote: this is a customer favorite, we'll take a 12 pack!<|endoftext|>The US Census Bureau has just released the latest data on commuting to work. In 2010, the average travel time to work was 25.5 minutes in the US, which is just a bit higher than in 2000, when it was 24.5 minutes.\n\nThe top five states with the longest commute times were:\n\nWest Virginia, with an average commute time of 34.2 minutes.\n\nDelaware, with 33.7 minutes.\n\nMaryland, with 33.4 minutes.\n\nPennsylvania, with 33.2 minutes.\n\nMissouri, with 32.8 minutes.\n\nThe top five states with the shortest commute times were:\n\nSouth Dakota, with 19.1 minutes.\n\nSouth Carolina, with 20.3 minutes.\n\nMontana, with 20.8 minutes.\n\nArkansas, with 20.8 minutes.\n\nNevada, with 20.9 minutes.\n\nThe graph below compares the average commute time in 2010 with the US average for 2000 and 2005.\n\nA quick look at the map of commute times in the US suggests that higher commuting costs aren't quite as widespread as you might think. Looking at the top ten counties with the highest and lowest commuting costs, we see that the East Coast tends to have higher commute times, while the West Coast has lower costs. This is consistent with the data I posted back in September, which showed higher commute times along the coasts.\n\n[Source: Table 11]<|endoftext|>We did it!

He played very well for Leinster on Friday night.

In addition, the organisation holds two annual meetings: the European Athletics Convention, a forum for the European athletics community, and the European Athletics Annual General Meeting, where the budget and activities for the upcoming season are decided upon. It also has two age group meetings (the European Junior Championships and the European Youth Championships) which are used for the development of the sport, the qualification for and entry into other competitions.\n\nThe first major competition organised by European Athletics was the European Athletics Championships, first held in 1934. This meeting was held in Turin, Italy and was won by Finland.\n\nCompetition rules\n\nEuropean Athletics runs the annual European Team Championships, first held in Stockholm, Sweden in 1966, the year after the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) recognised it as the continental association for Europe. Each year the organisation holds a number of competitions which athletes gain points for their team for. The biggest event is the European Athletics Championships, first held in 1934, and also known as the European Championships (after the IAAF started a separate event in 1990). This meeting is held two years prior to the Olympic Games, and incorporates competitions in athletics, the IAAF World Race Walking Cup and the European Cross Country Championships. The only annual competition between European Athletics and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics is the European Team Championships.\n\nThe European Team Championships was held 22 times, first in 1966 and most recently in 2013. Since 2010 the European Team Championships and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics are organised in the same year, held in the same stadium.\n\nAthletes\n\nSome of the most successful athletics countries are:\n\nAthletics Team\n\nControversy\n\nThe appointment of Svein Arne Hansen as President of the European Athletics is seen by many as contentious, as his country Norway has fewer than 100 members of European Athletics, and would therefore have little say in the governance of the organisation.[3]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\n^"

Try this instead: What happens to the environment when a company goes bankrupt?\n\nThe answer, according to ERI Economic Research Institute: On average, the environment will get significantly worse.\n\nERI compared the performance of companies with poor environmental, social and governance records against companies with strong records. The numbers are stark: If a firm is poor on those metrics, it is more likely to fail over the following five years. And once a company goes under, ERI's numbers show it's more likely to destroy more natural resources than it would have while operating.\n\nWhy does it matter? It shows that an ESG approach to investing can affect financial outcomes. \"We did this study to look at ESG risk in a new way. While a lot of research has looked at ESG performance, few have really looked at ESG risk,\" said Jim Hall, director of corporate engagement at the National Christian Foundation, which sponsored the study. \"And even fewer have looked at the impact of ESG on risk in the context of market returns. While we're not the first to do this, we are the first to do it in the context of ESG investment.\"\n\nHall presented the findings at a roundtable event in New York last week. Participants included a mix of investors, researchers and foundation officers. Hall said that NCF's goal was to understand the link between ESG performance and financial performance, and whether ESG management makes a difference in that context. ERI had already done some work on this issue. Now NCF wanted to take the analysis one step further, and fund the research, said Hall.\n\n\"While the results are unsurprising, they're quite interesting. What we've done here is develop a new metric that can be used to better understand ESG risks. And the result is that companies with poor ESG practices are more likely to go out of business,\" he said.\n\nAnd when a company goes under, ERI found that on average it's more likely to have destroyed more natural resources. ERI's analysis uses an estimate from the U.S. Bureau of Mines of the amount of resources companies use over the life of their business. For example, a paper mill would be likely to consume more natural resources than an office building.\n\n\"Companies with poor ESG practices are more likely to go out of business.\"\n\nBased on its data, ERI determined that when a company fails, it consumes roughly 20% more natural resources, on average, than it did while in business. And that's just over five years, said David Loomis, ERI's managing director of ESG research. Loomis presented the findings to the participants in New York.\n\n\"We're certainly not the first to look at this, but we were the first to be able to do it in a way that's scalable,\" Loomis said. \"We're able to do this analysis across thousands of companies. It's not just a handful of companies.\"\n\nLoomis said that the extra 20% of natural resources consumed by companies that go under could be anything from copper to water. \"It's not just that they're doing more mining, but they're using more natural resources, and it's generally by making themselves less efficient,\" he said.\n\nThe analysis is based on bankruptcy filings from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court's Electronic Research Filing System, which includes bankruptcy filings from all U.S. courts. ERI's research focuses on publicly traded firms. Loomis said the results are generally representative of publicly traded firms in general, although it's more focused on small companies. \"They're representative of the entire universe of bankruptcies, but there are very few mega bankruptcies,\" he said.\n\nERI also has data on roughly 300 companies that went bankrupt and didn't destroy any natural resources. ERI was able to determine what that sample looked like when it was healthy and when it was in bankruptcy. \"What was striking was that a number of these companies were performing really well in their ESG practices before they went bankrupt,\" said Loomis. \"They had good governance and social and environmental policies.\"\n\nIn that sample, ERI found that ESG performance wasn't that much different from that of companies that didn't go bankrupt. And it found that companies that did better on ESG performance metrics were more likely to go under.\n\n\"We're not suggesting that ESG is the only factor driving this risk,\" said Hall. \"We're trying to show that ESG is a factor. We're not suggesting that the only companies that go bankrupt are the ones that are not performing well on ESG issues.\"\n\nBased on its analysis, ERI determined that investors should use ESG risks to think about their investment strategy. \"Investors should look at this from the perspective of investing in a company,\" said Loomis. \"One might think that ESG performance and bankruptcy risk are correlated because a company that's poorly performing will have poor ESG.\"\n\nBut ERI's data show that's not the case. If a company is poor on ESG performance, there's a risk it will go bankrupt over the following five years. \"That's what we're trying to say,\" Loomis said.\n\nERI's research follows up on work it did last year for the Association of Private Enterprise Education, which is an association of about 400 conservative academics and economics teachers at universities and colleges in the United States and overseas. The group was looking at a different question: How should investors think about ESG risks in their portfolio?\n\nLoomis said ERI's new research found a link between ESG risk and financial risk, but it also raises questions.\n\n\"This research is really trying to understand if and how ESG is driving risk,\" Loomis said. \"We've been able to do a lot of analysis, but I think we need to do more. It's a new metric, and it's worth looking at further.\"<|endoftext|>Joining Alfie Kohn in helping our children grow into happy, healthy adults are Jean Twenge, author of The Narcissism Epidemic, Ken Bain, author of What the Best College Students Do, and Sharon Lamb, co-author of Packaging Boyhood. In an interview with LiveScience, Kohn explains why he is concerned with the way children are being taught in our culture.\n\nDiane Heacox: What are some of the ways we are failing children by pushing them to achieve in ways that leave them stressed and dispirited?\n\nAlfie Kohn: The American school system is doing a pretty good job of educating many children, but it's not doing a good job with others. Many kids are being failed. A study by UCLA's Civil Rights Project concluded that the education of African-American and Hispanic students \"is a national crisis.\"\n\nSome children are being put in the untenable position of having to choose between their self-esteem and their education.\n\nThe latter group may include children who come from families where there is very little interest in education. They may be bright kids who've never had any practice in schoolwork and who aren't naturally motivated. They may be students with diagnosed learning disabilities. They may be students with what in the past would have been considered character or behavior problems, who today may be labeled with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or bipolar disorder or depression. They may be children whose family lives are so chaotic that they can't seem to sit still in class or do homework assignments.\n\nBut it also includes students who are being pushed to achieve in ways that leave them stressed and dispirited. An alarming number of these children, by the way, are at private schools.\n\nYou write that the push to excel is actually hurting kids. How so?\n\nIf you don't learn to cope with stress, to deal with it effectively, then it will get to you. And if it gets to you, it will undermine your achievement. The problem isn't stress, it's how we cope with stress. The problem is that we expect students to be able to cope with stress while failing to teach them how to do that.\n\nSome students experience so much stress in school that their achievement is impaired, not by what they don't know but by what they do know.\n\nHow are we hurting kids by pushing them to achieve?\n\nWe're not paying attention to the fact that many kids are being put in the untenable position of having to choose between their self-esteem and their education. To take just one example: On many standardized tests, students are expected to answer every question correctly. But as any teacher knows, even bright kids sometimes don't know the answers to questions they"

However, in his 15 years as president of basketball operations, the Pistons went into decline.\n\nOn April 9, Dumars was relieved of his duties as the Pistons president. In the subsequent months, Dumars went back and forth about whether he would remain with the Pistons in some capacity, but according to a new report from the Detroit News, Dumars is now prepared to explore other opportunities.\n\nAccording to sources, Dumars has made it known that he is ready and willing to work for another NBA franchise, preferably one that’s closer to his residence in metro Detroit. The Seattle SuperSonics is one of the teams Dumars has been monitoring and, according to sources, the former Pistons president would have interest in serving as general manager.\n\nWhile Seattle has been rumored to be looking for a new GM, they hired former Minnesota Timberwolves assistant general manager, Sam Presti, as the new general manager earlier this month.\n\nAccording to the report, Dumars would also be interested in working as a consultant for the Pistons. The Seattle report comes as Pistons owner Tom Gores has reportedly been looking for a new team president since firing the organization’s vice chairman, Bob Wentz, earlier this month.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Dumars receives a job offer from another NBA team or stays with the Pistons in a lesser capacity. Since his departure from the Pistons, there have been several reports of teams looking to hire him.\n\nIn his 15 years in Detroit, Dumars helped turn the Pistons into a perennial Eastern Conference contender, but in recent years, he has come under scrutiny for questionable trades and poor draft picks. While there have been plenty of bright spots for Dumars during his time in Detroit, the recent years have been anything but stellar.\n\nNevertheless, Dumars’ career cannot be called a failure. Despite the recent years of decline, he helped build the Pistons into a legitimate title contender and championship team. He helped deliver two titles to Detroit and four NBA Finals appearances. As GM, Dumars made shrewd trades and drafted future stars in Grant Hill and Ben Wallace. The Pistons won 50 or more games every year from the 2000-01 season through the 2003-04 season, including two consecutive trips to the NBA Finals in 2004 and 2005.\n\nAfter some rough years at the end of his Pistons tenure, it appears Dumars is ready to return to an NBA front office and further his career.<|endoftext|>The retro look and no-nonsense approach of the workwear and outdoor-inspired 874 jacket from Canada's Rogue Territory provides a simple, timeless design with a few extra flourishes.

Alors que la cérémonie de remise des trophées E3 vient de se clôturer, force est de constater que le système de classification du jeu vidéo est encore loin d’avoir changé, malgré la pression du gouvernement.\n\nDans son discours du 18 février 2019, le président avait ainsi appelé à la « formation d’une commission sur la violence et la destruction en ligne » pour « travailler avec des éditeurs, des développeurs et des fabricants ». Il est aujourd’hui d’actualité de revenir sur cette idée d’une commission qui aurait pu être « nommée par le Président » selon le discours de Donald Trump, mais dont l’existence n’a pas été confirmée par le bureau du vice-président.\n\nLors de la remise des récompenses du E3, le 4 juin 2019, la question s’est régulièrement posée. « Le président Trump souhaite que nous ayons une politique plus sévère pour le jeu vidéo », a d’ailleurs rappelé l’animateur Geoff Keighley. Mais cela n’a pas empêché les studios de célébrer leur gros succès, y compris en sortant des propos offensants. Par exemple, le développeur du jeu de tir Metro Exodus, paru à la fin du mois de mars sur PC, PlayStation 4 et Xbox One, a salué le président, qualifiant sa mise à mort de voleurs et d’assassins de « symbole de puissance et de puissance de feu ». D’après ses développeurs, le système de jeu et de politique de réalité augmentée proposé dans Metro Exodus représente la vision du jeu vidéo américain à venir. Une vision qui semble en contradiction avec la politique du président, pour qui le jeu vidéo représente l’« ultimatum de la culture de la mort ».\n\nDonald Trump affirme que la violence et la destruction dans le jeu vidéo « nuit à la santé mentale des jeunes Américains » et « va à l’encontre des valeurs morales américaines ». Et d’ajouter : « le gouvernement devrait faire de la classification du jeu vidéo son objectif prioritaire ». Cela reviendrait à ce que le contenu de tous les jeux soit évalué à l’avance par des organismes indépendants pour ensuite être validé par le gouvernement américain. L’idée du président Trump n’est toutefois pas si fantaisiste. Depuis 2013, des compagnies comme Electronic Arts, Sony, Nintendo et Microsoft disposent déjà d’une classification des jeux vidéo. Cependant, cette classification ne fait que signaler les possibilités des jeux d’offrir une violence similaire à celle de la vraie vie. Ainsi, le jeu vidéo n’est jamais censuré.\n\nPourtant, cette classification, qui fait partie des exigences américaines en matière de jeux vidéo, est jugée inappropriée. Elle serait ainsi en contradiction avec l’idée d’une classification de l’industrie du jeu vidéo américaine. Cette classification, qui se base sur l’interdiction d’une telle violence, n’est pas ce que le président Trump avait imaginé. Elle n’est donc pas acceptable à ses yeux, et il l’a dénoncée à plusieurs reprises. La commission qu’il veut créer devrait donc avoir un rôle plus important et serait placée sous le contrôle du gouvernement. Elle s’assurerait donc que les compagnies respectent la classification, et non que les jeux respectent les interdictions.\n\nEt la commission d’affiner ses recherches\n\nLa première sélection des candidats à la présidence de cette commission pourrait être annoncée en juillet. Cette commission précisera ensuite ses objectifs et ses recherches d’un point de vue scientifique. Une étude du Center for Behavioral and Social Sciences in the Health à l’université de San Diego a cependant déjà été conduite par un chercheur de l’université de New York. Cette étude, publiée le 27 mai 2019, a montré que le jeu vidéo n’est pas source de violence, mais qu’il faut plutôt considérer le jeu vidéo comme une pratique sportive, avec les mêmes risques d’apprentissage que la pratique de différents sports. Cette étude a été présentée par le ministre des jeux vidéo, l’élu démocrate Josh Lowenstein, qui a dit vouloir « améliorer la situation ».\n\nLa présence de Donald Trump à la cérémonie de remise des récompenses E3 n’est cependant pas prévue. Il devrait se déplacer à la convention de la NRA, le 27 juin prochain, à Dallas. Mais l’enjeu du jeu vidéo reste une question prioritaire pour le président. Pour lui, « le jeu vidéo est au coeur de la violence et de la destruction ».<|endoftext|>“Bouncing Souls, (otherwise known as the longest running punk rock band,) have played everywhere from Mexico to Malaysia and from Australia to England, and are one of the few bands that have survived the DIY tour circuit of the 80s and the somewhat more commercial independent circuit of the 90s, while still maintaining their fiercely loyal fan base of skaters, punks, and just about anyone else who appreciates a good, fast, loud and melodic song.” – City"

And for all the debate about how he won't be able to take the next step to being a more dynamic NFL QB, I would contend that he never has to take a step at all because he does so much of what is asked of him.\n\n\n\nHis arm isn't going to get a lot better and that's probably the biggest knock on him in the NFL. But with his understanding of where to go with the ball, his accuracy, his football IQ, his footwork and mechanics, his ability to read defenses, his smarts and intangibles... Vandenberg might actually be pretty well-suited for the kind of system that translates well into the NFL.\n\n\n\nA big-armed athlete is fun to watch but they're the ones who get drafted in the 2nd round and are always the one or two missing pieces on a struggling team. Meanwhile, a smart, accurate, tough QB who is still developing could very well go in the 4th or 5th round and may not even be the best QB on his team in college but he could be very, very good.\n\n\n\nThe Saints could use that guy, in my opinion. And, if you're drafting in the 2nd round, it might be hard to not reach for that guy.\n\n\n\nOn that note, what do you think are Vandenberg's NFL-caliber strengths?\n\nThis is how I feel too, Vandy's QB rating is always low and then he turns around and throws 3 TD's. The Saints are a team that needs a QB that has a big arm that can make every throw, and that includes down the field. They have a great offense already, I'm just not sure if it fits Drew Brees well anymore. The Seahawks QB Russell Wilson, a QB that isn't a great pocket passer, can be good. I think the Saints have to address the QB situation even if it's through the draft.<|endoftext|>Dec 2, '12\n\nI know when I was pregnant I was extremely worried about getting a spinal tap, but it wasn't that bad.

But if you don’t enforce it, it’s useless.”\n\nFor instance, the CRA is only authorized to conduct a total of 1,100 audits of international companies per year.\n\n“To think you can audit hundreds and hundreds of companies in a few years is unrealistic,” Meunier said.\n\n“It would take decades to complete such a project.”\n\nAnother expert says Ottawa should also be looking at the tax treatment of stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation.\n\n“Stock-based compensation is one of the greatest contributors to the use of offshore entities,” says Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.\n\nThe government may also be underestimating the amount of money that companies are hiding in offshore accounts.\n\n“We’re looking at tens of billions, not $7 billion to $10 billion,” says Meunier.\n\nDespite the fact that Canada has been trailing the U.S. and Britain in cracking down on tax evaders, the federal government is under increasing pressure to deal with the issue.\n\nLast fall, the Conservatives’ own backbenchers took to Twitter to express their outrage over the offshore dealings of the Bronfman family, which owns the Claridge empire and has been associated with the party for decades.\n\nA recent report by the Commons finance committee also recommended Ottawa find new ways to collect money from international tax cheats.\n\n“The government is missing out on billions of dollars of revenue,” said New Democrat MP Peter Julian.\n\n“When you talk about tax cheats, they cheat us all.”\n\nThe NDP is also pressing the government to launch a major study of tax evasion.\n\nThat report would look at how much money the government is losing to people who aren’t paying taxes, and what can be done to reduce the problem.<|endoftext|>Moran S.S. and Castro J. (1999). In Situ Conservation of Genetically Modified Organisms (in the Brazilian Context)”. Center for Environmental Research and Conservation (CERAC), Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.\n\n\n\nThis study was conducted by the Center for Environmental Research and Conservation (CERAC) of Columbia University, New York. The study was conducted to assess the need for further regulation of the environmental risk of GMO's and to develop proposals for strengthening the regulation of GMO's in Brazil. The project was funded by a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented in collaboration with Brazil's Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). This paper describes a survey of selected academic and policymaking opinion makers in Brazil on the level of awareness, understanding, and concern with GMO's, both in terms of their own country and other countries. This was a follow up study to an earlier one that the author conducted in 1994 (Agostinho and Castro, 1994). The 1994 study was conducted at the request of the National Council of Genetic Engineering (CONEG), an organization created by the Federal Government of Brazil to study the issue of genetically modified organisms in Brazil. The 1994 study was a small survey of 34 individuals from federal and state government agencies, universities, scientific research centers, and NGOs. This later study, conducted in 1999, was conducted by a group from CERAC. It involved 49 individuals from 18 federal, state, and municipal agencies, 25 universities and scientific research centers, and 5 NGOs. CERAC used a pre-test questionnaire in the 1994 study and the results of this study are included in this paper.\n\nThe questions addressed in this survey included: what are their backgrounds, what are their current positions and the length of time they have held these positions; their level of expertise and training; their opinion of the level of concern over GMO's among the general population, among scientists, and among scientists in other countries; whether there should be further regulations, what agencies should be involved in regulating GMO's, and what the appropriate levels of involvement should be; what would be the best way to regulate GMO's; what are the major concerns with GMO's, how can they be solved, and what are the technical/scientific concerns with GMO's; what would be the benefits of GMO's, what are the risks to the environment, to human health, and to food security; whether there should be labeling of GMO's; what the labeling requirements should be, who should enforce the labeling, and what the penalties for violating labeling requirements should be; whether they are aware of"
"The latest numbers from the Manpower group find that most managers don't feel their employees are at the top of their game. In fact, only 40% of managers rated their employees as performing at a \"world class\" level.\n\nInterestingly, the percentages were quite similar across industries and job levels. There was a noticeable difference, however, in the quality of employees at large and small companies. Fifty-one percent of employees at large companies rated themselves as world class, compared to just 31% at small firms.\n\nThe difference between small and large companies is consistent with the ongoing trend toward organizational downsizing and pressure to reduce headcount. The benefits of downsizing are generally viewed as lower costs and greater efficiency, but this is typically accomplished by reducing the level of resources allocated to the employees that remain, and a less than stellar employee experience. The results from the Manpower group's research suggest that while downsizing can help organizations achieve short-term cost-cutting goals, long-term productivity will suffer. In fact, the costs associated with poor employee morale can be very significant.\n\nHiring the right people, creating a good culture and atmosphere, and ensuring employees receive proper training can help avoid the potential downsides of downsizing. These measures can also help foster the growth of a \"world class\" organization. It's clear that it's possible for smaller organizations to provide world class service to their customers and business partners, but the message from this research is that only a small percentage of small firms are achieving that goal.\n\nDo you think the quality of the employees you work with is important? Do you work for a small company? Would your performance rating be different if you were at a large company?\n\nLearn more about what it takes to be a world class employee at the 10 Simple Rules of World Class Customer Service blog.<|endoftext|>hondacivic93\n\nSwamp Butt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook out kid, they keep it all hid\n\nJoined: January 2012\n\nPosts: 120\n\nSwamp Butt\n\nAnyone else have an old fart for a roommate?

It also had questionnaires on various demographic variables like age, gender, parental occupation, previous illness and hospitalizations, medical problems like obesity, hypertension, diabetes and any previous problems with binge eating. The statistical analysis was carried out by the Pearson Chi Square test.\n\nResults:\n\nMost of the students in the study had a positive attitude towards obese patients. The problem of obesity in the student's families was quite high and most of them belonged to lower socioeconomic class. There were also a large number of medical students who themselves had faced obesity in their childhood. The males reported more difficulties in dealing with obese patients than the females. But this difference was not statistically significant. The students felt that their families had the greater difficulty in dealing with obesity. The mean score on the EAT-26 was 22.64±8.75 indicating that the students were obese themselves and had personal experience of obesity and this was statistically significant. Also the frequency of being fat as a child was very high in the students which was highly significant.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThere is a perception that obese patients have poor prognosis and this is not true.

"There is an attitude that many people have that if something is new and different, it must be better. I have always thought that this was a stupid attitude. That is why I think I am such a difficult consumer to sell to. People think that I want the latest and greatest, but that really is not true. I want a product that is reliable and works the way I want it to. I want something that I can rely on to do the job for me. I have this attitude because I really hate a product that I buy and then has to be replaced a short time after I buy it because it breaks. I want to buy something and know that it is going to last for a long time. That is why I like Apple. The old Macs used to last for a very long time and still work great. I liked that. They would be older, but they worked great. They had a long life, so it was a good value.

But what I found most interesting is the number of places where the median price for an existing home is in the $250,000 range, which would be considered mid-priced. But it's far, far more than most folks can afford in those markets.\n\nAnd I would argue that's a big part of why the U.S. economy is sluggish, and that's why so many of us in the U.S. and Canada are holding back on our spending plans.\n\nIn those markets shown below, it's a problem for anyone earning less than $200,000 a year. The first couple that jumps out at me is Washington, DC, where even if you earn $200,000, your home payment for a median priced home is going to be around $1,100 per month, and your income would be too high to qualify for a conventional loan for anything under $600,000.\n\nIt doesn't even have to be DC. In San Francisco, the median price for a home is about $760,000, while the average salary is $111,000. The median price for a home in Seattle is $550,000, and average salary is $87,000.\n\nSo people are getting stuck. They are only able to buy a place in a city they can't afford. Or, they're paying well over $200,000 in cash, and are now unable to afford to sell their home and move. Or, they have to move, and in doing so, are now stuck paying rents that are far higher than the same people were paying on their home, and making less money to begin with.\n\nNow, people can debate all day on whether supply is low or demand is high, but in the end, the average income for households is nowhere near the median price for a home in a lot of those places shown below. The markets have grown up around a lack of supply. This is why the D.C. metro area is by far the highest, with an average income of $96,000 and a median price of $420,000.\n\nAnd it's not just one issue. I can't help but think this is a real big factor behind why the U.S. economy isn't really doing all that well, and I think it's something we've got to start addressing as a country. You have very few markets that are both affordable and accessible to most people.\n\nSource: Demographia<|endoftext|>NuSTAR has discovered the farthest-away black hole yet.\n\n“We’re seeing black holes in the distant universe for the first time. Up until now, we’ve only detected them in the nearby universe,” NuSTAR principal investigator Fiona Harrison of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, said in a press release. “We hope to figure out how the black holes in the distant universe grow to masses much larger than any black holes we see nearby.”\n\nThe black hole is located inside a galaxy cluster known as RX J1347.5-1145, located 9.9 billion light-years from Earth. This cluster also contains several galaxies with “hyper-luminous” centers, which are galaxies that have supermassive black holes at their cores.\n\nBut, the black hole discovered by NuSTAR has an especially “hyper-luminous” center, meaning it is significantly larger than any other black hole yet observed in the distant universe.\n\n“We are starting to see the variety of black holes that exists in the universe,” said Christian Wolf, a member of the NuSTAR team and an astronomer at the Australian National University in Canberra. “They’re not all the same. Some are bigger or smaller. Some are bluer or redder. Some don’t give off much radiation at all.”\n\nThe discovery of this black hole is the first result from the NuSTAR survey of distant galaxies. Using NuSTAR’s high-energy X-ray capabilities, the mission has discovered about 20 distant black holes and supermassive black holes.\n\nHowever, NuSTAR isn’t the only telescope observing distant black holes. Another mission, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR’s sister satellite), also discovered a black hole on July 4, 2018.\n\n“We’re going to find hundreds of them.” — Stijn Wuyts, a NuSTAR co-investigator at the University of California, Berkeley\n\n“We’re going to find hundreds of them,” said Stijn Wuyts, a NuSTAR co-investigator at the University of California, Berkeley. “This is a field where we’ve only just started.”\n\nAccording to Wuyts, the NuSTAR survey of distant black holes and supermassive black holes will last about two years. This will allow scientists to map black holes and their host galaxies, learning about the evolution of both.\n\n—\n\nBy Olivia Harvey, Earth.com Staff Writer<|endoftext|>In this day and age, a lot of people have taken to reading ebooks on their devices rather than traditional books.

"Today I went to Paddington Markets for the first time!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was fantastic! Lots of stalls selling all sorts of food, clothes, trinkets etc. And we were there at the right time, as they were packing up for the night. So we were able to buy a whole bunch of food from various stalls, so we had dinner already planned for tomorrow night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't really find anywhere to sit down and eat our food. There was lots of seating available, but everyone was waiting for friends, so there were no spare tables for us to have a sit down at. The result? Half our food ended up being eaten on the floor, as it was just so busy that we couldn't find anywhere else to sit. Not a huge problem, but I'd have preferred it if I could have had a proper sit down with the food.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, though, it was an awesome experience, and I'm excited for our next night out to the markets!<|endoftext|>This article was first published in German in Die Internationale (United Secretariat of the Fourth International) No.35-36, Autumn 1979\n\nThe Spartakus League of Germany (Spartakusbund) was founded in 1916 by the revolutionary Karl Liebknecht, together with the other members of the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) who voted for the party’s break with the Kaiser’s war policy. Spartakus was the name of the ancient Greek rebel army led by the slave Spartacus who fought against Roman oppression and became one of the early symbols of working-class revolution.\n\nDuring the war, Spartakus published a number of pamphlets, notably the Open Letter to the Central Committee of the German Social Democracy on the Tasks of International Socialism (December 1916). This Open Letter discussed the tasks of the German working class in connection with the war and the fate of the International. Lenin referred to it as ‘a magnificent, very important, very serious and very timely document’. Spartakus was also the first to develop the strategy of the Workers’ Councils, which was later taken up by the Russian Bolsheviks. Liebknecht even called for an immediate overthrow of the government and the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat. He began to agitate among the German soldiers and in July 1917 was arrested and sent to the front, where he took part in a number of clandestine activities.\n\nThe Spartakusbund was able to organise various clandestine publications. With the beginning of the revolutionary movement in November 1918, its membership increased dramatically and it soon became a mass organisation of the German working class.\n\nIn the revolutionary crisis of November 1918, Liebknecht published the appeal of the Spartakusbund, which stated that ‘it was the duty of the workers to overthrow the government and the generals who were responsible for the war. It was necessary to end the anarchy which existed in Germany and put in its place a Workers’ and Soldiers’ Councils system which would really organise the whole of economic life in the interests of the working class’. The Spartakusbund was the first organisation to publish a pamphlet on the organisation of the Workers’ Councils (Workers’ Councils and the Revolutionary Struggle) and to advocate the formation of workers’ militias to defend the councils. It also began to publish the newspaper Die Rote Fahne (The Red Flag).\n\nAt the beginning of January 1919, the Spartakusbund took part in the workers’ uprising in Berlin which was led by the communist Karl Liebknecht. This was the beginning of the German Revolution, which lasted until 1923 and in which the Spartakusbund played an important role.\n\nAfter the abortive Berlin uprising, the Spartakusbund initiated the formation of the German Communist Party (KPD). Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg participated in the first congress of the KPD, which took place from 30 December 1918 to 2 January 1919. The first national conference of the KPD, which took place from 28 March to 1 April 1919, had 26 delegates present, including five delegates from the Spartakusbund.\n\nRosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and other leading members of the Spartakusbund were members of the Central Committee of the KPD. On 5 January 1919, Rosa Luxemburg became editor of the paper Die Rote Fahne, and Liebknecht became deputy editor. The paper became the central organ of the KPD. Liebknecht and Luxemburg also edited and contributed to other publications of the party.\n\nIn the Reichstag elections of January 1919, the Spartakusbund, along with the Communist Party of Bavaria and the Communist Party of Hessen, were affiliated with the Communist International.\n\nAt the Second Congress of the Communist International, held in Moscow in July 1920, a decision was taken to reorganise the German Communist Party into the KPD (of Germany), with a membership of 40,000. At this Congress, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were elected to the ECCI. In addition to their positions in the KPD, Liebknecht was elected a member of the Executive of the Communist International, and Luxemburg was a member of the Presidium of the KPD. At this Congress, Liebknecht took an active part in the debate on the role of the revolutionary party in the International, and the relationship between the Executive and the Congress of the International.\n\nOn the basis of the work of the Congress, the KPD published its Theses, Resolutions and Decisions, a document that became the theoretical basis of the Communist International and which in particular outlined the role of the party and of the Executive.\n\nDuring the years of the German Revolution, Liebknecht and Luxemburg continued their campaign for the unity of the working class, for the unity of the social democrats, the communists and the anarcho-syndicalists. They worked together with a number of left social democrats, including Julian Borchardt, Willi Eichler, Hermann Greulich and Wilhelm Pieck, to defend the unity of the working class and the revolutionary movement in Germany. However, despite their efforts, the left of the German Social Democracy remained divided and the question of the revolutionary unity of the working class could not be resolved in practice.\n\nLiebknecht and Luxemburg fought for the workers’ councils, and were opposed to the centralisation of the revolutionary power into the hands of the executive committees of the councils, which formed the basis of the later Bolshevik party system in Russia. They advocated the widest democracy in the councils. During the German Revolution, Liebknecht, Luxemburg and the Spartakusbund fought for a strong, centralised, unitary Communist Party and for a strong, centralised Workers’ International.\n\nDuring the German Revolution, the Spartakusbund launched a number of armed actions, including the demonstration on 1 May 1919 in Berlin, the struggle for the defence of the first revolutionary district, the struggle against counter-revolutionary General Walther von Lüttwitz, the attack on the building of the Central Executive Committee in Berlin, and the struggle against the reactionary forces of Kapp in March 1921. Liebknecht and Luxemburg were both seriously injured during these struggles. Liebknecht was seriously injured in the attack on the Central Executive Committee of Berlin and died on 15 January 1919. Luxemburg was seriously injured in the Kapp putsch of March 1921 and died on 15 January 1919.<|endoftext|>The board was an item he got from a neighbor that he could not give away, he said, and the bird was the same model that flew in the 1970s.\n\n“So I came up with the idea, let’s put the bird on the board,” he said.\n\nThe sign went up three days ago, and Lalli said he was impressed by the attention it was getting.\n\n“Everybody knows this,” he said of the bird. “It’s a part of our lives.”\n\nHe was unsure of the future of the sign.

Kavanaugh denies the allegations.\n\nThe vote comes a day after both Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, testified at a dramatic Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\nMcConnell said a vote would occur this week, adding, \"I'm not going to play three-card Monte with this.\"\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is calling the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser \"compelling.\"\n\nThe Iowa Republican senator says the panel will vote on Kavanaugh's nomination Thursday.\n\nGrassley says \"nothing that has been presented corroborates\" allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.\n\nKavanaugh denies the allegations.\n\nFord told the committee that Kavanaugh attacked her and tried to remove her clothing while he was drunk at a party when they were teens in the early 1980s.\n\nShe said she's 100 percent certain it was Kavanaugh.\n\nThe GOP chairman repeatedly refused to call other witnesses who Ford said were present during the attack.\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is \"totemic,\" and he says the choice will be a test of the moral leadership of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nSchumer said Tuesday that \"everything\" in American politics is riding on the choice.\n\nThe New York Democrat says he hopes senators will \"rise to the moment\" and reject Kavanaugh because of what he called serious questions about the nominee's temperament and impartiality.\n\nSchumer also said that a \"thorough and complete investigation\" by the FBI of Kavanaugh's past will show that he is \"very much like\" Justice Clarence Thomas, for whom Schumer voted against confirmation.\n\nKavanaugh said under oath Monday that he believes the 1993 Thomas confirmation hearings were \"a high-tech lynching.\"\n\n11:10 a.m.\n\nAnita Hill says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh appeared to be pushed by President Donald Trump's team to \"move beyond\" the sexual misconduct accusations that have threatened his nomination.\n\nHill was testifying on Capitol Hill alongside other witnesses who spoke to lawmakers about sexual misconduct. She says that as a result, \"we are missing the real opportunity\" to address sexual violence.\n\nHill testified in 1991 about her allegations that Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her when they worked together. Thomas denied the accusations and was confirmed.\n\nHill spoke Tuesday alongside victims of sexual abuse, sexual assault and harassment.\n\nHill says there was \"no way to redo 1991, but there are ways to do better\" in the treatment of sexual misconduct allegations.\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nTwo women who say they are survivors of sexual assault have called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nRachel Crooks of Ohio and Maria Gallagher of Maryland described their experiences during a news conference on Capitol Hill.\n\nCrooks says that as a 22-year-old she was attacked by an \"entitled man\" in an elevator in Trump Tower. She says she is alarmed by the memory of having to \"fight off his attempts to choke me.\"\n\nGallagher says she was sexually assaulted as a teenager. She says she was assaulted by a boy who went to her Catholic high school and that the assault has had a \"lifetime impact\" on her.\n\nGallagher says the assault weapon \"was the power that he had over me\" and that \"to this day I remember that moment.\"\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators have expressed concern about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying he has appeared to be dismissive of claims of sexual assault against him.\n\nSens. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island questioned Kavanaugh's judicial temperament during Tuesday's hearing.\n\nHirono said Kavanaugh is \"a wonderful nominee,\" but says it's his \"judicial temperament\" that has been at issue.\n\nHirono cited the \"way that he approaches the bench, the demeanor that he has.\"\n\nLeahy says Kavanaugh is a \"good man,\" but added that he doesn't \"think he's the right man\" for the job.\n\nWhitehouse says he has \"real concerns about this being in character from what we've seen.\"\n\n10:55 a.m.\n\nThe hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has begun.\n\nChairman Chuck Grassley says the panel has received \"the results of the FBI's supplemental background investigation\" into Kavanaugh.\n\nGrassley says he'll be giving the first hour to Kavanaugh to make his opening statement, and then he'll give the first hour to an unnamed female lawyer to question the judge about his views on various legal issues.\n\nDemocrats have objected to the plan, saying it's an \"unprecedented\" process for the Judiciary Committee to have the attorney question a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThe panel is set to vote on the nomination on Thursday.\n\nKavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nAnita Hill says the 1991 Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas were \"a difficult time for me,\" and says she thought it was \"in the best interests of the country\" to testify at the time.\n\nHill testified Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault and harassment in response to the recent accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nKavanaugh and Thomas were both nominated to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThomas was confirmed after Hill testified. He has denied Hill's allegations that he sexually harassed her when they worked together.\n\nHill says she has \"been asked by many people\" over the years whether she thought Kavanaugh was who he was back then.\n\n10:20 a.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake says the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is \"a difficult decision\" for senators who \"must do what they think is right.\"\n\nFlake was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh's nomination for the District of Columbia Circuit Court in 2006.\n\nFlake, of Arizona, is a key Republican vote in the confirmation battle. Flake tells NBC's \"Today\" show that he is \"still recovering\" from the hearings of Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teens.\n\nKavanaugh denies the allegations.

Lindsey Graham says the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford was \"very compelling,\" and says he thought she seemed to be \"sincere.\"\n\nBut the South Carolina senator says there were \"things that she forgot to address.\" Graham says those include questions about how she got to and from a party in the Washington area where she says a drunken, teenage Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.\n\nKavanaugh denies the accusation.\n\nGraham was a lead questioner of Kavanaugh during Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\n10 a.m.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats want an FBI investigation of the allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but"

Foley is a motivational speaker with a long series of jokes about his alcoholic father, his lack of success with women, and his various unfortunate situations.\n\nThe character was first played by Chris Farley on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1992, and again on \"SNL\" in 1994, 1995, and on the final episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" on May 15, 2000.\n\nThe character of Matt Foley made his debut on \"Saturday Night Live\" during the second season.\n\nHis most famous line is \"Hi, I'm Matt Foley, and I'm gonna put my foot in your ass!\". Other catch phrases include \"No shit!\" and \"Yeah, that's the ticket!\". He frequently refers to his recently deceased father, usually when he is discouraged about his job prospects.\n\nHe is the basis for the character of Al in the film \"Tommy Boy\". The movie \"Tommy Boy\" had started production in 1994, but was delayed after a poor test screening, so Farley reprised the character on \"Saturday Night Live\" for a series of sketches in the fall of 1994 in order to remind viewers of the character and raise awareness of the movie.\n\nIn 1995, Farley's sketches about Foley were released as a direct-to-video movie, \"Matt Foley: You Can Do It\". The character is featured in the 1999 video game \"NFL Blitz 2000\" as a secret character.\n\nIn 2010, Jason Zumwalt played the character in an advertisement for \"Paramount Insurge\", a company which has been described as \"the new division that's looking for films that break out from the typical Hollywood studio fare.\"\n\nIn 2014, David Koechner portrayed Matt Foley on an episode of \"Parks and Recreation\". The character appears in \"Tommy Boy\" as well.\n\nMatt Foley's motivational career is the primary source of his income. In one of his sketches, he is told by his agent that his chances of success are \"one in a million\". Despite his lack of success, he refuses to change his tactics or mannerisms. His speeches are full of poor advice, misanthropic cynicism and just plain rude behavior. He also has a series of anecdotes about his family, most prominently his father, who was also a motivational speaker, but was even more unsuccessful than Matt.\n\nIn the film \"Tommy Boy\", Matt Foley was played by Chris Farley's former \"Saturday Night Live\" castmate, David Spade. Spade's character was named Al and was a truck driver instead of a motivational speaker.\n\nIn the short-lived animated television series \"Drawn Together\", a character named Toot Braunstein was based on Foley. Like Foley, Toot was depicted as a heavy drinker and womanizer, and even wore an outfit very similar to Foley's.\n<|endoftext|>DZRH\n\nDZRH is a commercial news/talk radio station serving Mega Manila market, which serves as the flagship station of the Manila Broadcasting Company in the Philippines.

"Black Bullet episode 13 is another episode to help you understand what’s going on in the plot. After last episode, it seems that almost everyone in the cast has been seen in some way. There are still people yet to be seen, but this is pretty close to the end of the series.\n\nWhat’s odd is that these people seem to all live in Japan. I’m curious as to why these beings are only attacking Japan, or if they attack other countries. It might be that the government has put out some sort of cure for the virus, and so it won’t spread to other places.\n\nThe scenes with the Russian were quite interesting, but then the series fell into the same pacing issue that it had last week. The problem with these scenes is that they feel like filler. Sure, they may be important later, but right now they just feel like they take up time.\n\nThe scene where Rentaro and Tina go to the US was also a bit slow, but it seemed to advance the story. I liked the explanation of the origins of the US now becoming “cursed land”. It gives a little more story to the whole situation, and makes Rentaro and Tina’s mission a bit more meaningful.\n\nThings got a lot more interesting towards the end. That’s when Rentaro and Tina met an adult woman named Kotori. She’s quite an interesting character, and she’s someone I’m sure will have a bigger role in the series.\n\nOverall, this episode was alright. It still felt like the show was missing some information, but I think that may be due to the fact that I haven’t read the manga. Either way, it was nice to see a few more important people be introduced, and the show seems to be coming to a conclusion.\n\nIt’s not really that this show is bad. I’m having a bit of trouble deciding what to rate this. It isn’t bad, and it isn’t really amazing. The thing is, I can’t say I disliked this show. I’ve found myself thinking about it when I was doing other things, so it was interesting.\n\nSo, I’m going to give this show an 7/10. This is because it’s just an alright series. It was fun, but it was just alright. I did like it, but I can’t say that I would say that I loved it. It might be that it’s just not really my style, but that’s okay. There is some pretty big fanservice though, which I’m not really a fan of. That does put me off of the show a bit, and it’s why I can’t really give it a higher score.\n\nAgain, I’m not sure if I want to continue with this show, or just jump straight to the manga. I do feel like I have to keep watching this show though, but we’ll see what happens.\n\nSo, what did you think of Black Bullet episode 13? Did you like it, or are you ready to end this series already? Let me know in the comments, and as always, thank you for reading.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>Tutorials and How to's ‎ > ‎ Creating Custom Types\n\nContents\n\nExtension Methods\n\nReturning Other Types\n\nWorking with Custom Types\n\nThis section will show you how to create a custom type that can be used in R# and add an extension method to it. To follow along with the examples you will need the following code that you will be extending:\n\npublic static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; }\n\nThe extension method will need to be able to take any AppState and determine if it matches any of the strings that are in the enumeration. To do this the extension method will use an operator in C# called Match. To use this operator you will need to import the System.Linq namespace:\n\npublic static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; } using System.Linq; public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; }\n\nNext you can add your extension method to this type by adding the following to the top of the file:\n\npublic static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static bool IsIn ( this AppState state, string value ) { return ( state.ToString ( ) .Equals ( value ) ) ; } } using System.Linq; public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static bool IsIn ( this AppState state, string value ) { return ( state.ToString ( ) .Equals ( value ) ) ; } }\n\nIf you had a lot of different types you could create another extension method for each type.\n\nReturning Other Types\n\nA great way to create a class that can be easily extended is to have it return a new class when you call it. To do this the class will need to have a constructor with at least one parameter that can be passed in from the outside world.\n\npublic static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } }\n\nThe extension method for the custom class will look a little different this time because you will have to specify the type of the state it is trying to return and pass in a parameter of the same type. Here is an example of what that could look like:\n\npublic static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } }\n\nThis type will now be able to return any ErrorPageState from the extension method:\n\npublic static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public const string PageError = \"PageError\" ; public const string ArticlePage = \"ArticlePage\" ; public static class ErrorPageState { public ErrorPageState ( ) { } } } public static class AppState { public const string HomePage = \"HomePage\" ; public"
"Racial profiling: It happens in America. Not just in the street. Not just in police cars and trains and buses. Not just in \"The Jerk\" and \"Death Wish\" and \"Police Academy.\" It happens in the federal judiciary system, where judges have used every device at their disposal to arrest, convict, imprison and punish young African-American men.\n\nA new report by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, based on painstaking, voluminous research, quantifies the impact of this kind of race-based sentencing, showing that the racial disparity in federal drug prosecutions over the past 25 years has been massive. A young black man has been almost four times as likely as a young white man to be prosecuted in federal court for a drug offense.\n\n{snip}\n\nThe disparities were so great that during the 1990s, in all but a few of the federal judicial districts, the rate of prosecution of young black men for drug offenses actually exceeded the rate at which these men were committing drug crimes in their home communities. In some districts, the LDF report found, \"if young black men were prosecuted at the same rate as young white men, drug possession prosecutions of young black men in those districts would drop by more than 50 percent.\"\n\nThe report focuses on prosecutions in the 1990s. But in some districts, it noted, the level of drug-crime disparity is actually getting worse. In Richmond, for example, the drug arrest rate for young black men was 2,043 per 100,000. The arrest rate for young white men was 477 per 100,000. In Philadelphia, the numbers were 2,248 per 100,000 and 730 per 100,000.\n\n{snip}\n\nA black man in his mid-20s or 30s who has not gone to college is, in the eyes of the federal government, a first-rate criminal.\n\nOriginal Article<|endoftext|>Best Wishes to all\n\n\n\nMy first love\n\n\n\nSo hard to resist\n\n\n\nWith this I mean to say\n\n\n\nHope it isn't in vain\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day\n\n\n\nIt's still the same old game\n\n\n\nEvery now and then\n\n\n\nI pretend it's just a game\n\n\n\nBut we're always in a war\n\n\n\nSo give me something\n\n\n\nI can hold on to\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nGive me something\n\n\n\nTo believe in\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nGive me something\n\n\n\nTo believe in\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nBest Wishes to all\n\n\n\nI'd love to thank you all\n\n\n\nFor the wonderful things you've done\n\n\n\nMay I make a small suggestion\n\n\n\nHave a nice life, have a nice life\n\n\n\nHow can I ignore the warning\n\n\n\nWhen I'm still in love with you\n\n\n\nAnd every word you say to me\n\n\n\nSeems to echo in my mind\n\n\n\nAnd I can't stop thinking\n\n\n\nAnd I can't sleep at night\n\n\n\nAnd when it's all gone by\n\n\n\nWe'll never be the same\n\n\n\nAnd so I put the blame on you\n\n\n\nCause we've never been so in love\n\n\n\nAnd I need to feel you\n\n\n\nEvery little thing you do\n\n\n\nHow can I ignore the warning\n\n\n\nWhen I'm still in love with you\n\n\n\nAnd every word you say to me\n\n\n\nSeems to echo in my mind\n\n\n\nAnd I can't stop thinking\n\n\n\nAnd I can't sleep at night\n\n\n\nAnd when it's all gone by\n\n\n\nWe'll never be the same\n\n\n\nAnd so I put the blame on you\n\n\n\nCause we've never been so in love\n\n\n\nAnd I need to feel you\n\n\n\nEvery little thing you do\n\n\n\nHow can I ignore the warning\n\n\n\nWhen I'm still in love with you\n\n\n\nAnd every word you say to me\n\n\n\nSeems to echo in my mind\n\n\n\nAnd I can't stop thinking\n\n\n\nAnd I can't sleep at night\n\n\n\nAnd when it's all gone by\n\n\n\nWe'll never be the same\n\n\n\nAnd so I put the blame on you\n\n\n\nCause we've never been so in love\n\n\n\nAnd I need to feel you\n\n\n\nEvery little thing you do\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be there<|endoftext|>Written by Andrew Pollard Thursday, 14 August 2014\n\nComics\n\nTwo of our favourite creative teams from across the pond are joining forces in a six issue mini-series for Image Comics and if you’re a fan of dark, intense crime stories then this one is right up your street.\n\nAs part of Image Expo in San Francisco last week, Brian K Vaughan and Marcos Martin announced that they would be teaming up once again, this time for a new mini-series entitled Barrier. The pair worked together previously on “Ex Machina”, a modern retelling of Frankenstein, which won them both Eisner Awards. That run is quite rightly regarded as a modern classic, but now they are going it alone again with a brand new story. The pair will also be joined on the series by Muntsa Vicente who will be colouring and lettering the book.\n\nSet in a dystopian future where the United States is now divided into two distinct nations, one of which is completely landlocked, Vaughan will pen the series, with Martin providing the art. In the story, a father attempts to cross a dangerous barrier to see his daughter. “It's a story about what it means to be a father and a man and a human being and it's a story about trying to do the right thing when everything goes wrong,” said Vaughan. “I've been so lucky to have worked with so many of the best artists of our generation, and Marcos is certainly one of them. This book is really going to be beautiful.”\n\nVaughan also praised the brilliance of his friend and collaborator, stating, “ Marcos' work on this book is really going to blow people away. It's a story that he and I really connected on and it's just going to look spectacular.”\n\nExpect to see “Barrier” arrive in stores in the second half of 2015.\n\nSHARE YOUR COMMENTS BELOW OR ON TWITTER @STARBURST_MAG\n\nFind your local STARBURST stockist HERE, or buy direct from us HERE.

"Herreshoff was born on 5 December 1869 in Nova Scotia, Canada to Robert and Emily (née Doughty) Herreshoff. He was one of nine children, three of whom became notable. His brother, Nathanael Greene Herreshoff, was a naval architect and his younger brother, Albert Julius Herreshoff, was a yacht designer. Herreshoff was first employed as a machinist with the New York Shipbuilding Company. He began his own engineering company, but with his brother, Nathanael Greene Herreshoff, left for Newport, Rhode Island in the early 1890s to start another. In 1892 he married Pauline Robinson and they had two sons and two daughters. He was elected a member of the American Society of Naval Engineers in 1897.\n\nHerreshoff invented and patented a number of devices, including a differential gear, a gyrocompass, and a gyroscopic compass, among others. His wife's uncle, the Reverend Charles Doughty, invented the horse tread wheel and his father Robert Herreshoff, who was a prolific inventor, held many patents, including one for the screw propeller.\n\nAfter several years of successful yacht building, Herreshoff and his brother, Nathanael Greene, bought a former frigate, USS Wyoming, from the United States Navy, and converted it into a yacht for Alfred G. Vanderbilt. The boat won the America's Cup in 1895.\n\nIn 1903, Herreshoff designed the popular 12 Metre class sloops Gladiator and Mayflower. This was followed by the 12-Metre class Sweet Briar, and later by the 15-Metre class Solace.\n\nIn 1907 Herreshoff moved his shipyard to Bristol, Rhode Island, where he built several large yachts, including the 1907 Gloucester fishing schooner Herreshoff No.1, designed to take the Gloucester fisherman out to fishing grounds further from the shore than ever before. This innovation proved the concept of the \"dragger\" fishing boat, which revolutionized the industry. Herreshoff went on to build more than 600 fishing boats at Bristol. In the 1920s, the Bristol yard began building boats under contract for Hinckley Yachts. After their first contract, they were allowed to put the HINCKLEY name on the transom, leading to the popular name \"HINckley YAchts\" or \"Hinckley Yachts\".\n\nHerreshoff's career was interrupted by World War I. He joined the United States Navy in 1917 and rose to the rank of lieutenant commander by the end of the war. He was in charge of the Navy's experimental projects, and in 1918 invented a special compass that allowed aircraft to navigate safely to their destinations without human assistance.\n\nAfter the war, Herreshoff returned to private yacht design. He built a total of 157 vessels, including America's Cup defenders Reliance (1914), Resolute (1916), Ranger (1918) and Rainbow (1920), as well as 12-Meter defenders Vigilant (1919), Defender (1922) and Vigilant (1924).\n\nHerreshoff died on 21 January 1950 at his home in Barrington, Rhode Island.<|endoftext|>From the February 2018 Desktop News | Imagine a book that’s at the forefront of medical research. A book that holds the promise of a cure for diabetes. A book that can end cardiovascular disease. A book that just might alter our DNA to provide an extra seven years of life.\n\nIt exists, and you can access it in seconds from your own desk. We’re talking about the Human Genome Project. And thanks to a University of Chicago (UCH_026174) and University of Chicago Medicine release, you can download it for free.\n\nThe project was launched in 1990 and finished in 2003. It started as a proposal by the National Institutes of Health and, by the time it ended, it had cost $3 billion. But for nearly two decades, it was the single most important medical project in the world.\n\nYou can read the project’s final report on the NIH website, but if you want more details about the genes it identified, you can use the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s website. It has many details about the project, but its real strength is the list of the 9 million genes it identified. It’s here, and it’s updated every time the scientific community publishes a new gene.\n\nRight now, that’s happening all the time.\n\nAs the Washington Post’s Rachel Feltman notes, we’re in a golden age of genetics research. The field has come a long way in a short time. In 1991, when the Human Genome Project started, researchers thought we’d find 100,000 genes. Instead, we found 19,000. Feltman writes, “Today, the most up-to-date figure is 21,000, although researchers think there are likely to be more.”\n\nIf you look through the list of genes, you’ll see that it’s broken into many parts. Each part is a chromosome. You can also access each chromosome in its entirety, but there are millions of genes, so the result will be too big to view. That’s why the National Center for Biotechnology Information breaks the chromosomes into smaller pieces.\n\nSome of those parts have less than 100 genes. Others have more than 100,000.\n\nThat’s just the beginning. Not only is the list of genes broken into pieces, but each gene is also listed as an accession number. When it was published, the project was stored on computers and every part of it had its own identifier. The national center has taken that information and made it searchable. So if you find a gene you want to know more about, you can find that information in seconds.\n\nHere’s another example. One of the interesting findings of the Human Genome Project is that genes that carry the instructions to make blue eyes and brown eyes are very close to one another. We don’t know why.\n\nBut the map of those two genes, in the national center’s searchable database, tells us the exact location of those genes.\n\nIt’s not just blue eyes. The national center has a map for most genetic traits you can think of.\n\nIf you want to learn about a gene and what it does, you can do so in seconds.\n\nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information has been around for a long time. It was established in 1988 to support biomedical science. And as you can see, it’s one of the most important medical resources you can access.\n\nAnd it’s free.<|endoftext|>Washington State: About a half-dozen coal-fired power plants are in various stages of planning or development on the shores of Puget Sound, prompting complaints that they would dramatically increase pollution in the region and conflict with the state’s plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved permits to the builders for two plants — one near Bellingham, Wash., the other near Longview, Wash. — after permitting changes were requested by Washington’s governor. Opponents have appealed the permits to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, and are asking that the permits be withdrawn.\n\nThe appeals “will demonstrate that the agency can no longer defend the approval of these dirty coal plants,” said Bill Arthur, a lawyer for environmental groups. The proposed plants “will generate thousands of tons of greenhouse gases every year, while killing thousands of people.”\n\nThe Department of Energy, which provided $7.1 billion to help coal-fired plants, would be a big winner if the coal plants are built, analysts said. The department has committed $1.65 billion in loan guarantees for the Longview plant and $3.5 billion for the plant near Bellingham.<|endoftext|>Book Review: Afterworlds by Scott Westerfeld\n\nEven though this book came out in September, I am only just getting around to reading it. I’ve been so swamped with work and in a slump with my writing that it’s hard to get around to reading books that I actually enjoy.\n\nScott Westerfeld is known for writing the Uglies and the Leviathan series, both of which I’ve read and enjoyed. Afterworlds is a bit different from those books, as this book is written in dual narrative form. We have a beginning novelist (Darcy) and an unpublished writer (Lea) whose stories intertwine and overlap.\n\nI’ll be honest: the start of this book is really rough. I found the first 200 pages to be repetitive and boring, as Darcy goes over her writing process and the book that she is writing while also being a teen with typical teen problems. As I got further into the book, I was glad that I hadn’t put it down. Darcy’s book becomes so much more than her book, but it’s Lea’s story that keeps you coming back to find out what’s going to happen to both of them.\n\nThere are also flashbacks to Darcy’s early childhood that I found quite interesting and thought that it added a new depth to the story. While reading this book, I didn’t want to put it down, even if I wasn’t always the biggest fan of the writing.\n\nOverall, I give this book a four out of five. If you are a fan of Uglies or Leviathan, this book will be a must read. For people who don’t know Westerfeld or want"
"BENGALURU: A man from Bengaluru has alleged that his wife faked her death for a huge insurance payout . Jayakumar, 45, has been battling the insurance company for years, after his wife, Lakshmamma, 44, 'died' of liver cancer in February 2011.Jayakumar had claimed a sum of Rs 11 lakh, which the insurance company, after scrutiny, paid him a part of it. However, they suspected foul play and sent Lakshmamma to the police. She was found to be alive and was charged for fraud by the police. After much wrangling, the couple had returned the money, but continued to fight the case. After repeated hearings, the police filed a B report. In a twist to the tale, the High Court, last week, ordered the insurance company to pay Jayakumar the remaining Rs 6 lakh, plus an interest of 9%. The judgment also directed the police to remove the charges against the woman. \"I was forced to return the money and still had to fight for the insurance money,\" Jayakumar told TOI.When he was working at a bank, Lakshmamma was a bank manager. They met in the early 90s and married in 1997. \"She was a simple woman, I never expected her to do such a thing. She would wake up early and leave for work, only to return late. My neighbours said she was always out,\" said Jayakumar, adding that she was always out of station for official duties.When he asked her about it, she would come up with excuses. But in the third month of their marriage, he had gone to her office and saw her chatting with another man. \"She was talking to him like a lover, I was shocked.

This is for the sake of preventing the spread of SCP-3xxx-2 to an even greater extent.\n\nCapitalise the \"S\" in \"Site\".\n\nDue to the constant presence of radiation from SCP-3xxx-2, it is advised to wear a radiation suit before engaging in conversation with SCP-3xxx-1.\n\nDon't say \"due to\" unless you have a reason for it. Also, you don't need to say \"it is advised\".\n\nContainment breach can be detected through the interference of cellphones and other devices emitting radio waves.\n\nThis should be moved to its own paragraph in the containment procedures, not placed where it's explaining something in the description.\n\nDescription: SCP-3xxx-1 is a humanoid entity of unknown origins, currently designated as a male due to its voice patterns and self-identification as such. SCP-3xxx-1 has a height of 170.6cm and a mass of 61.3kg.\n\nI'd like to see some sort of measurement here. \"Unknown origins\" is the closest you're going to get, since you don't know how far back it goes.\n\nIts biological features are average for a human being, with the exception of its eyes, which are green in colour.\n\n\"With the exception of\" doesn't sound right to me. I'd change this to something like \"with average human biological features, with the exception of its eyes\".\n\nSCP-3xxx-1 was discovered in [REDACTED], on 05/12/20██, and was recovered by the Foundation on 06/12/20██.\n\nAgain, I'd like to see some sort of measurement. Also, if you're just referring to a place in the description, just say \"The Foundation recovered SCP-3xxx-1 in [REDACTED] on 05/12/20██.\"\n\nSCP-3xxx-1 has the ability to [REDACTED]\n\nYou don't need to censor the information here. \"As part of SCP-3xxx-1's anomalous properties, it can [REDACTED]\".\n\nMost of the following are for clinical tone:\n\ncompletely lacks a tongue;\n\nlacks all fingernails;\n\nis unable to talk, even when being provided with a microphone or a speaker;\n\nlacks any physical form of communication other than its eyes, with these taking on a variable colour depending on the environment in which SCP-3xxx-1 is located;\n\nseems to show signs of intelligence, with these intelligence levels being similar to that of an average human being;\n\nlacks any form of interaction, with even threatening to kill SCP-3xxx-1 not being able to evoke a response, with SCP-3xxx-1 simply looking back at the person making the threats with its eyes;\n\nThere's a lot of clinical tone here. Most of this can be reduced to \"SCP-3xxx-1 lacks most normal human physical features, and cannot communicate in any way other than its eyes.\"\n\nHowever, SCP-3xxx-1 has shown some characteristics that it shares with other SCP objects, such as its apparent ability to read the minds of those looking at it.\n\nThat's a bit of a stretch. I'd change this to \"SCP-3xxx-1 has demonstrated the ability to read the minds of those looking at it.\"\n\nThat being said, this doesn't really seem like an SCP article. It has some similarities to SCP-682, but doesn't quite measure up to it. You'd have to have a more extensive history to go along with this, such as something that you can't normally see, and that you might want to keep contained. Maybe something that makes it special.\n\nI'll leave this here.<|endoftext|>\n\nTHE ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH\n\nMARCH 14, 2001, Page B-3 by Kevin Jamison for the Post-Dispatch St. Louis writer Kevin Jamison earned the 2000 Agnes Scott College Book Prize for his non-fiction book about the city's fabled Ritenour School.

IN THE EARLY 1980s, St. Louis came to be recognized as one of the most segregated cities in the country, and it was no surprise that the Ritenour School District, which serves a large swath of north St. Louis County, would be one of the most segregated school districts in the area. Ritenour was regarded by many as the \"back of the bus\" school district in the area. Some of the area's white families would bus their children to nearby suburban districts, fearing the prospect of sending them to Ritenour. \"The consensus among educators and researchers,\" writes Kevin Jamison in Ritenour: A Culture Is Reborn, \"was that Ritenour was probably the poorest performing district in the city and among the poorest performing districts in the state. . . . The district suffered from poor teacher morale, inadequate facilities, low attendance, and a large percentage of students requiring special education.\" But the perception of Ritenour and its students has been changing dramatically over the past several years.

Ted Cruz.\n\nPaul introduced a bill on March 15, 2011, the first day the House was in session, that would cut one third of the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget.\n\nBut the language was more than mere budget cutting. The bill was the essence of Rand’s view of what society should be and how the government should operate.\n\n“Pollution,” Paul said, “is a result of improper land use, improper development, improper allocation of resources and the failure to hold property owners accountable for their actions.”\n\nThat is an extraordinarily blunt statement of libertarian dogma, that the government should have nothing to do with the actions of private business, and that the free market will solve all problems.\n\nThe bill would also put a moratorium on the EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, which might lead one to wonder how Paul would have voted on the Clean Air Act of 1970 that set the regulatory process in motion.\n\nRand’s ideas have had a major influence on the party’s presidential candidates, most of whom have cited her influence on their lives.\n\nIn 2011, at an event for the Atlas Society, Rand’s intellectual vehicle, that she founded in the 1960s, Gov. Rick Perry said, “Atlas Shrugged changed my life.”\n\nPerry, who may run for president again in 2016, followed this up by making a video with Rand in which he said, “I think it’s time for people to stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough.’”\n\nIn 2013, Rand Paul said, “A lot of people don’t associate me with being a believer in the free market, and that’s probably because of a lack of understanding of what I really believe. And the reason is, I do believe in the free market. I think it helps lift people out of poverty.”\n\nThis is the core of Rand’s philosophy that would, if implemented, result in vast disparities between the richest and poorest in America, but would also eliminate government regulation, such as the law that protects workers from coal miners who suffer black lung disease from being too close to the mine’s entrance.\n\nRand has also inspired a group of Republican women to call themselves “The Intellectual Yet Idiots” who routinely read excerpts from Rand’s books at meetings in the Capitol and Tea Party events.\n\nIn a book called “The Partisan: The Life of William F. Buckley Jr.,” the late National Review founder’s biographer Justin Vaisse notes that Buckley banned Atlas Shrugged from his magazine, saying that it would “undermine Christianity and lead to the collapse of the American political order.”\n\nBuckley, who served in the House from New York from 1951 to 1965, was an ardent anti-Communist and found Rand’s version of libertarianism too extreme.\n\nThat’s the irony of Rand’s rise to prominence among conservatives. In a 1985 Playboy interview, Buckley called Rand “a profoundly anti-social mind,” and that, “If there is a single theme, a single thread that runs through the work of Ayn Rand, it is her contempt for the poor.”\n\nBuckley and Rand fought constantly and with such ferocity that in 1960, Buckley said, “I do not accept, I will not accept, and I will never accept an association of any kind with that utterly contemptible creature.”\n\nIn 1980, Buckley decided that Rand had become too prominent a figure to ignore and went after her and her followers in a column titled “The Right’s Rand Re-examined.”\n\nBuckley’s magazine, and his allies, would continue to go after Rand and Randians for years afterward.\n\nToday, Rand’s influence on the GOP is enormous and it’s more than apparent. It’s so significant that if Rand were still alive, she’d probably be a GOP superstar.<|endoftext|>For President Obama’s critics, it was a triumphant moment: His administration’s Justice Department was having to defend a federal court order that would allow the latest group of Texas residents, who were being detained by immigration authorities, to obtain legal representation and gain access to immigration court hearings. The court decision came on the same day the Obama administration issued a memo directing federal immigration authorities to take steps to make sure that pregnant women in detention are provided with adequate medical care and are housed in humane facilities.\n\nThe administration’s actions in Texas and elsewhere are, according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, the latest evidence that the administration is “enforcing the law” when it comes to immigration. In another recent example, in June, the Obama administration ordered federal immigration authorities to defer the deportations of certain undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nBut as both the Texas detention and medical-care decisions demonstrate, the Obama administration has been using the power of the executive branch to mitigate the harsh consequences of its immigration policies, particularly in the cases of undocumented women and families. Some of these executive orders are the result of negotiations and political compromise, which are required by Congress’s unwillingness to adopt an immigration reform law. But they have also demonstrated how a president with a different mindset and a different understanding of immigration might be able to effect real change if he or she were in the White House.\n\nSo as the next presidential election cycle moves into full gear, the issue of immigration reform could prove to be an important one. If it does, it will be another of many areas where the Obama presidency will have been a disappointment for progressive activists. But there are plenty of lessons that Democratic candidates can learn from Obama’s missteps and misfortunes in this area.\n\n***\n\nWhile most people are focused on the issue of unauthorized immigration, the president is facing tough questions about his immigration policies regarding the undocumented parents of American children, the undocumented children of American citizens and lawful permanent residents, and the parents of both these groups. These categories of undocumented immigrants have had a rough ride in recent years.\n\nAfter the Obama administration signaled it would scale back deportation efforts in its early years in office, the Department of Homeland Security turned its attention to the nation’s interior and began detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants, many of whom had lived in the U.S. for years, some for decades, and had families. The administration then deported a record number of unauthorized immigrants, with numbers peaking in 2012 at nearly 400,000 removals. (For comparison, there were fewer than 100,000 deportations in 2008 and around 250,000 in 1996.) The administration has deported a total of 2.8 million people.\n\nTo be sure, the unauthorized population has been shrinking. And, as the Pew Research Center notes, for the first time since the Great Recession, more unauthorized immigrants have left the country than entered it. So there’s been a reduction in the pool of those who can be deported. But, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, there are still around 5.1 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.\n\nThe record number of deportations has made the plight of unauthorized immigrants a key issue in immigration politics. Obama critics argue that the president has deported far more people than his predecessors. But according to the Migration Policy Institute, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush also deported significant numbers of unauthorized immigrants—about 2.7 million and 2.8 million respectively.\n\nThe Obama administration has also been criticized for its failure to achieve comprehensive immigration reform in Congress, despite the president’s pledges during his 2008 campaign that he would push such reform if he were elected. (In his first term, he repeatedly pledged to “fix” the system, a pledge he no longer makes.)\n\nCritics on the right argue that the president has not pushed hard enough for reform. But the proposals the administration has put on the table are not as liberal as its critics claim. The president’s most recent reform proposal, for example,"

On Thursday, we looked at how self-driving car companies should focus on deploying vehicles as opposed to just testing them on roads.\n\nToday, we will focus on what effect self-driving cars could have on auto insurance and how the industry can adapt to the changing landscape.\n\nAs technology develops, auto insurance companies will have to adapt. We're already seeing the effects of autonomous vehicles on insurance, but it's not all bad. In fact, the technology could have a positive effect on auto insurance.\n\nRead on to learn more.\n\nDecreasing Accident Rates and Claims\n\nOne of the biggest selling points for self-driving cars is that they could make roads safer. With cars that have the ability to sense their surroundings and react accordingly, fewer accidents should occur.\n\nAnd as more self-driving cars are put on the road, there will be fewer accidents involving human error.\n\nIf the technology is implemented successfully, the rate of accidents on the road could go down. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that from 2011 to 2015, the rate of fatal accidents dropped by 40 percent.\n\nReducing the amount of accidents on the road should result in a decrease in the number of auto insurance claims. But the question is, how much?\n\nReducing Claims Costs\n\nAccording to The Economist, the introduction of self-driving cars could lead to a decrease in the number of crashes by 90 percent. But that could lead to a reduction in auto insurance claims by just 50 percent.\n\nWhile that might sound like a lot, it could be a huge benefit to auto insurance companies. Instead of having to pay out $212 billion a year, the industry could save about half of that.\n\nThat means that auto insurance companies could turn their focus to other areas. For instance, the introduction of self-driving cars could allow companies to eliminate physical damage coverage from their policies. The cost of premiums could also go down, and that means insurance companies would have more money available to give back to policyholders.\n\nBut the real savings could come from those who aren't covered by auto insurance. If self-driving cars do end up getting on the road by 2020, as some companies are claiming, then millions of Americans could become shut out of the insurance market. That could lead to a decrease in claims costs of 30 to 50 percent, which could have a huge impact on the bottom line of insurance companies.\n\nWhat Auto Insurance Companies Could Do\n\nThe report from The Economist also predicted that there would be a shakeout in the auto insurance industry. Companies that focus on insuring older drivers would have a hard time competing with those that specialize in underwriting the young and the safe. That could lead to consolidation and lower premiums.\n\nThat shakeout could mean that some auto insurance companies would adapt and begin writing policies for self-driving car owners. The technology is already here, and if auto insurance companies are willing to change with the times, then they could benefit from the new market.\n\nSome states have already begun preparing for this change. In New York, for example, the state's Department of Financial Services proposed regulations that would allow for the operation of self-driving cars. In addition to licensing vehicles, the state will also begin the process of licensing drivers.\n\nNew Opportunities for Insurers\n\nThe potential shakeout in the insurance industry might not all be bad. While some companies might fail, new opportunities could be created for those that stay in business.\n\nSelf-driving cars could allow insurers to offer specialized products, such as telematics-based policies that allow cars to report how they are being driven. That data can then be used to adjust premiums based on how safe a driver is.\n\nOther companies might look at using self-driving cars for transporting goods and people, which could allow for new revenue streams. Uber and Lyft could see the biggest changes, as companies like Progressive and Allstate could take over insuring the cars they use to move around passengers.\n\nPreparing for a New Market\n\nWhile many things still need to be worked out with regard to self-driving cars, the technology will soon be coming to market. The question is, how will insurance companies respond?\n\nOne thing that is for sure is that the future of auto insurance will be different. And auto insurance companies will have to find a way to compete in the new market.\n\nIt's going to be an exciting time for the industry. If it isn't prepared for the changes ahead, then it could find itself becoming irrelevant. But those that adapt could be the ones that come out on top.<|endoftext|>CLOSE Want to submit your letter to the editor? Here is how.

The massacre also marked a point in the French Wars of Religion.\n\nThe massacre started on the night of 23–24 August 1572, two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the military and political leader of the Huguenots. The assassin, François Ravaillac, took advantage of the chaos and confusion as the Parisian mob spilled out of the \"Poisoned Candle\" inn, killing three of Coligny's bodyguards and wounding the admiral before being subdued.\n\nThe king ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the massacre spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks, the massacre expanded outward to other urban centres and the countryside.\n\nThe massacre marked a turning point in the French Wars of Religion. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, as well as many re-conversions by the rank and file, and the Huguenots' weakening military position in the following years.\n\nWith a detailed knowledge of the court at the time of the massacre, the author Victor Hugo provides a classic description of the events, and of the general massacre, in his novel \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\".\n\nAs with all the religious wars or massacres of the 16th century, the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day was a calculated military action with premeditation and escalation in an atmosphere of collective violence and hysteria. A precedent for the massacres can be found in the \"Nordic bloodbath\" (1520), when the government of Copenhagen, Denmark, killed between 5,000 and 11,000 people at the urging of the local Lutheran clergy. The king, who had hesitated to act against the Huguenots, the \"Famille Sante\", died within days of the assassination of Coligny, himself allegedly a target of the plot.\n\nHistorians have found that Henry III, Duke of Guise, who had sent letters to the pope encouraging him to wipe out the Huguenots, may have been an instigator of the attack. In a letter to the Cardinal of Lorraine, the duke complained that the pope had been too weak. The cardinal then used his influence with the king to organize the massacre. This plan may have been ultimately inspired by Charles IX's mother, Catherine de' Medici, who according to a contemporary source (the Venetian Giorgio Varistori) instructed the Duke of Guise and the Constable de Montmorency to organize the murders:\n\n\"to maintain the honour of the prince and the State, and to keep the people of this kind from growing too numerous.\"\n\nSome historians have viewed the subsequent escalation of the French Wars of Religion as a deliberate plot by Catherine de' Medici, who was consistent in her policy of strengthening the political and military position of her son, King Charles IX. Having failed to grasp the theological issues that drove his mother, Queen Margaret, King Charles IX, at the suggestion of his adviser, Cardinal Richelieu, created the Colloquy of Poissy (1561), in which French Protestants and Catholics met in an attempt to reach consensus on doctrine. With the Peace of Saint-Germain (1562), however, the wars erupted again. This policy was not only financially costly, but also ineffective against the Huguenots. In the three-year period following the Peace of Saint-Germain, the Huguenots made considerable political and military gains. The French Huguenots were able to defeat several royal armies between 1567 and 1570.\n\nAlthough the Huguenot political movement was powerful and a significant portion of the French aristocracy was allied with it, the leadership of Henry of Navarre remained uncertain.\n\nAt the court of Catherine de' Medici, Henry of Navarre, leader of the Huguenots, was presented to the court by his uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine. In 1570, the Medici were much weaker than they had been, as Catherine de' Medici suffered from a debilitating illness and her son and heir, Charles IX, was unpopular. A plot to assassinate Charles and restore the entire power to the House of Medici was discovered, but it failed in the first attempt on 24 April 1570. However, the second attempt on 22 August 1572 was successful. While Catherine was dying, the young king acted decisively. He called for his uncle, Charles of Guise, to be killed, and attempted to secure the military leadership of the Huguenots for his own brother, Henry, Duke of Anjou.\n\nOn 23 August, Henry of Guise was murdered in his sleep by a monk. Anne de Montmorency, another leader of the Huguenots, was also targeted. The monk gave the assassin a dagger and told him to"

"After 10 years of repeated declines in raw milk consumption, the category has enjoyed a welcome boost this year, according to IRI data. During the first quarter of 2014, sales were up 12.5%, versus the same period in 2013, the market research firm reported. In an interview with Food Navigator USA, IRI’s Christine Barton attributes the increase to a resurgence of interest in raw milk’s supposed health benefits. “The benefit for those who can consume raw milk is that it does not have the additives that processed milk does,” she says. “So it's more nutritious, it's more protein and is also a source of healthy bacteria.” The source of the raw milk's \"health benefits,\" which Barton goes on to list, is still being debated. However, IRI’s data does suggest that, whatever the actual reasons behind the raw milk boom, health-conscious consumers are at least driving much of the growth. According to Barton, in addition to the category’s high-end products, such as raw milk cheese and yogurt, “there has been a growth in popularity of flavored and specialty milk—with all the different types of flavored milk like vanilla and strawberry.”<|endoftext|>What Makes Hammers Excellent Lifting Tools\n\nLoads of workout devices were produced and sold for the intent of making your life easier. They have assisted in making the process of bodybuilding a lot easier. Nevertheless, among the few devices that have actually stood the test of time, is the iron hammer. Hammers are not really just lifting devices; they have a long history.\n\nInvention of Hammers\n\nBefore we discuss the use of hammers in bodybuilding, let’s take a look at the history of the hammer. It’s the first ever known tool that was created for the purpose of construction. It dates back to 8,000 BC. It is believed that the use of hammer was invented by the rock hatchets.\n\nThe rock hatchets have actually been used for a long time. People had actually used these hammers to split open, break down and smash stones. Gradually, more inventions came into play. For example, hammer that was connected to anvil was actually used in carpentry.\n\nLater on, the Egyptians introduced the tool that was attached to a handle. They had actually used it to cut and carve stone and wood. Hammers are created for a specific function and for specific materials.\n\nThe Old World and the New World\n\nIt is very important to understand the differences between the New World and the Old World.

You don’t need as much effort in order to lift something with the hammer as you do with a weight. It will be the same thing for the dumbbells.\n\nIf you are doing an exercise with a hammer, the amount of weight that you need to lift is not much.\n\nThe weight of the hammer is usually as much as the things that you are trying to lift. The weight of the dumbbells is usually more than the things that you are trying to lift. The hammer is very efficient.\n\nMore Strength\n\nThe other benefit of using the hammer is that it is very efficient in terms of getting more strength.

"Every year for Christmas my family always got together and the kids got a gift. My brother and I would argue for a few weeks about who would get a gift and eventually the night of the event the parents would sit down and decide who got a gift. One year the parents decided that my brother and I would have to share a gift. At first we were mad, but after a few days we decided to come to a compromise. We agreed that we would have to share the gift but whoever received the most toys would be the winner. On Christmas morning we were both pumped to find out who would win. After all the gifts were opened my brother won. I was so happy and ready to play with all the toys. I noticed that my brother was not as happy as I was. When I asked why he told me that he got the big toy that was only for boys and I got the doll that was only for girls. He was sad that he would never be able to share the toys with his best friend, me. From then on I decided to never let a girl have the toy that I wanted. I always wanted the most popular and expensive toys because I did not want any girl to have something better than me.\n\nThe first video game that I really remember wanting was Super Smash Brothers. The video game was released when I was in middle school and it was super popular. There was a lot of excitement in my school because we had the opportunity to play the game before it came out. I always thought that the character Link was the coolest because he could transform into different characters. When the game came out I bought it right away and loved playing it with my brother. I was not concerned with the fact that I was playing with a girl, because it did not matter to me. She was not my best friend at the time but I did not want her to have the same game as me.\n\nThe video game Tom Clancy’s The Division was a big game for me and I was excited to get it. This was a game where you played with other people in a multiplayer setting. You had to play as a team and communicate to complete the game. The girl who sat next to me in school loved playing the game and I thought she was really cool. When I finally got the game I played with her a lot, but after a while I started to get bored. I felt like she was the one who was telling me what to do and that she was being bossy. I told her that we needed to play with other people because she was annoying me. After that, I would only play with her when she was playing the game and she told me that I was being a bad teammate. I really liked playing the game and did not want her to ruin it for me.\n\nThe game Fortnite was released a few months ago and I immediately downloaded it. It is a survival game that is similar to The Division. This game was on my phone, and I would play it in class and during my free period. After a while I started to get bored with it, but my best friend really liked it and started to play it all the time. The game was starting to get popular in our school, and I would be on a different team than my friend. I did not want her to have better than me, so I tried to play better than her and talk trash to her. I wanted to make sure that she did not have the most wins or kills because she was a girl and I wanted to be better than her. This game was something that I was able to play with my best friend, but I did not want her to be the best at it.\n\nThe game Apex Legends is another game that I really enjoy playing. This game is similar to Fortnite but it is played on a console. When I found out that this game came out I was so excited. I immediately downloaded the game and started to play. My brother plays this game a lot, and I really enjoy playing it with him. When my brother told me that his best friend was getting the game and we could play together I was so excited. The girl that he wanted to play with was my best friend, and I was happy because I could play with my friend and my brother’s best friend. When the day came for us to play, I told her that I could not play because I was busy. I did not want to play with her because I thought she was bossy and annoying. After a few weeks of not playing the game with my friend, my brother’s best friend started to play with me. We would play all the time and had so much fun. I could not believe that I let a girl ruin my game for me, but it was all because I did not want her to have something better than me.\n\nIn conclusion, I was very jealous of the girls who got the toy that I wanted to play with. I was never afraid of playing with girls, but when I played video games I would not want them to be the best at it. I realized that I should not let a girl have the same game as me because it was not fair. I am also a girl and should not think that girls are weaker or better than me because I am a girl. If I play with girls I should not make them feel bad or bossy, because it is not nice. If I get a toy that a girl likes I should not give it to her, but I should let her play with it. Being a girl does not mean that I should be bossy or weaker, and I will not let anyone make me feel that way.<|endoftext|>The 2011–12 edition of the Elite One was the 66th season since its establishment. A total of 16 clubs competed with four of them being new to the competition. The league began on 28 September 2011 and ended on 17 June 2012. Lobi Stars won their first league title, finishing two points ahead of second-placed AS Police, with both sides dropping points on the final day of the season.\n\nTeams [ edit ]\n\nChanges from 2010–11 season [ edit ]\n\nThe following changes were made since the 2010–11 season:\n\nThe following clubs have remained in the league:\n\nThe following clubs have been promoted from the 2010–11 National League:\n\nChanges to the league's name [ edit ]\n\nAfter a brief absence, the name \"Elite One\" returned to the league's name.

"The earlier section of this year was a bit rough for hip-hop fans. First, Pimp C died, then just about every major artist out of New York seemed to drop an album that was not good. The lack of good hip-hop is a recurring trend every year, but the quantity was overwhelming this year. As we approach the halfway point of 2009, however, it looks like things are beginning to get a little better. We’ve seen quality releases from rappers like Common and Q-Tip, some top-notch mixtapes from Yelawolf and Kendrick Lamar, and even a few good albums from the youngsters, Kid Cudi and Asher Roth. So far, it’s not quite the turnaround that we saw after the Grammys (but maybe the albums coming out in the second half will get people’s hopes up).\n\nSince I didn’t have time to write about all of the new releases, I figured I’d just mention a few of the ones that I like. In no particular order, these are my current favorites:\n\nCommon – The Dreamer/The Believer: I know, this album is old by now, but I’m still kind of surprised by how much I like it. I was a pretty big Common fan back in the ‘90s, but I’ve been relatively disappointed by his recent releases. This album, however, might be one of the best things he’s ever done. I mean, I never thought I’d be able to listen to an entire album of Common’s on repeat, but here we are. There are so many great tracks on this album. “Chi-City,” “Mr. Nigga,” “Dooinit,” “Hustle Harder,” and “They Say” are my favorites.\n\nKanye West – 808s and Heartbreak: After five really solid albums, it seems like Kanye has turned a corner. Instead of riding the waves of hype, he went out on his own and recorded an album that was entirely different from anything he’s ever done. This is not the first time Kanye has done something like this (see his work with Jay-Z on The Blueprint) and it’s quite possible that it won’t be the last. 808s and Heartbreak was a long time coming, and it might have been the album that made Kanye West.\n\nPusha T – Fear of God: Pusha T is really coming into his own. After his work on the Re-Up Gang’s We Got It 4 Cheap, he released this mixtape. The beats on this mixtape are really, really good. One of the things I really like about Pusha T’s music is that he sounds like he’s just going in on a beat. There are no really long, drawn-out verses. His delivery is quick, and it almost sounds like he’s not quite done when he’s actually done.\n\nAsher Roth – Asleep In The Bread Aisle: You would think that releasing an album called Asleep In The Bread Aisle would really affect the sales of the album. You know what? It doesn’t seem to have affected it much. The album has sold around 60,000 copies so far. I think it’s because it’s really good. His debut, Asleep In The Bread Aisle, is the first great album to come out of this generation of rappers. His next album will likely be the last time he’s able to sell this many copies. It’s a really good album, and it has some of the catchiest songs I’ve heard in a long time.\n\nKid Cudi – Man on the Moon: Welcome To The Dream Factory: For those of you who don’t know, Kid Cudi is a Cleveland rapper who is signed to Kanye’s G.O.O.D. Music label. His mixtape was, as you might expect, really good. And his first single, “Day N’ Nite” is an awesome song. It’s become a staple in my library, and I can listen to it a few times a day. This mixtape was great, and his upcoming album, Man on the Moon: The End of Day, is one of my most anticipated albums of the year.\n\nYelawolf – Trunk Muzik: I think that I’m really going to like Yelawolf’s upcoming album, Trunk Muzik 0-60. I really like this mixtape, and I think he’s one of the few rappers that’s out there that is really different from everyone else. His beats are really good, too. The song “Gangster” is my favorite, and he released a video for it, which you can check out here:\n\nAtmosphere – When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold: I’m not sure how I feel about this album. I think I’m one of the few people who doesn’t love it, but I’m not hating on it either. The production is a little different from what they usually do. It’s not as smooth, but it’s got a little more edge to it. Slug’s vocals are awesome as always. I’m just not sure how I feel about the overall product. It’s definitely not as good as the other albums they’ve released.\n\nThe Game – LAX: After his best album, The Documentary, The Game seems to have hit the dreaded sophomore slump. I didn’t like The Documentary, and I don’t like this one much, either. He has a lot of high-profile guests on this album (Dr. Dre, will.i.am, Kanye West), but none of them really save the album. I will say, however, that the singles he’s released off this album have been really good. “Sauce” with Lil Wayne and “Pot of Gold” are my favorites.\n\nThe final two albums that I have to mention are ones that I really enjoy, but for different reasons. I’m not sure how many people will like these albums, but I think they’re both worth mentioning.\n\nBusta Rhymes – Back On My B.S.: I was really happy when I heard that Busta was releasing a new album. It was only a few years ago that I stopped following him as closely as I used to, but this album made me realize that I needed to pay attention to him again. This album is not a great album, but it’s really fun. It’s actually Busta’s best album since Extinction Level Event: The Final World Front.\n\nJadakiss – The Last Kiss: I really like Jadakiss. I think that his flow and lyrics are really good. I also think he’s really funny. After his really good mixtape, D.I.A. (Do It All), I thought he would deliver something that would be a contender for the top 10 this year. Well, I was wrong. The Last Kiss is the worst album that Jadakiss has released to date. I was really disappointed when I heard it. It’s not that it’s bad, it’s just that I expected a lot more. If you’re looking for a mixtape with a lot of good songs, check out D.I.A. If you want to pick up one of his albums, go with The Kiss Of Death.\n\nThat’s all for now. I’ll have a review of Pharoahe Monch’s latest, W.A.R. (We Are Renegades), in a day or two, but I’m taking a break from rap for a little bit. There’s plenty of other stuff to write about, so I’ll probably be writing about a bunch of different stuff until the fall.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>We are delighted to offer the fantastic HABA Key-Ring Puzzle Animal - Ducky.\n\nWith so many on offer recently, it is wise to have a name you can trust.

"I have been reading this book on and off for the past year and I must say, it is one of the best spiritual books I have read. It was given to me by a good friend, which I am very thankful for. The book was written in 1997 by Henri Nouwen and the title of the book is “The Genesee Diary: A Spiritual Journey”. Henri Nouwen was a Roman Catholic priest, a prolific writer, and a world renowned spiritual leader. The book is a very personal account of his time spent at the Benedictine Monastery in Genesee, NY. If you know me, then you know I am a huge believer in the monastic lifestyle. I have never been in a monastery, but I think it would be a wonderful experience and I am planning to do it one day. It’s funny because my little town of Seneca Falls has a monastery too. I have never been there, but I am not a fan of taking on debt, so when the time is right, I’m sure I will go.\n\nIn the book, Nouwen goes into great detail about his spiritual thoughts and beliefs, as well as his life, struggles, and doubts. He starts the book off by writing, “The monastery had become a source of great happiness for me. I was not yet quite sure about God, but I knew that God was the One to whom I was attracted in the monastic life.” Throughout the book he talks about his attraction to God, his struggles with temptation, his doubts, and his worries. He also shares his passion for the arts, music, nature, and people. His writing style is so vivid, and makes it very easy to imagine what he is talking about. It is one of those books that you just don’t want to put down. I highly recommend this book to everyone.<|endoftext|>The Sicilian Naval Battlefleet, 1066\n\nIn 1066 the Normans of Southern Italy invaded Sicily, starting a century of Norman rule in Sicily, and increasing the Sicilian fleet.

In the summer of 2007, the internship experience was described as “cooperative” in the overall summary provided by the student. The study looks at a particular area of psychological concern (i.e., professional identity) through several different variables and dependent variables. It specifically investigates whether the student has developed an identity of being a professional in the field of Psychology, as well as an understanding of what is involved in becoming a professional in the field. It also looks at the potential positive and negative psychological effects that the student may have undergone due to the internship experience. The study seeks to determine if the internship experience has increased the professional identity of the student and what the student has learned from the internship experience. The study also investigates whether the student was satisfied with the internship experience and whether the internship experience would influence the student to consider pursuing a career in psychology. The study results indicated that the student’s professional identity was increased by the internship experience. The student’s knowledge of what it takes to become a professional in the field of psychology increased, as did his satisfaction with the internship experience. Additionally, the student was more likely to consider pursuing a career in psychology following his internship experience. The study provides insight into the impact of a psychology internship experience on a student’s professional identity, knowledge, satisfaction and perceived impact on considering pursuing a career in psychology.<|endoftext|>Permaculture guru Bill Mollison\n\nWith the very little support they had at the time, Bill and others set up the first demonstration site. On a previously weedy area of land, they set out apple trees, sweetcorn, rows of potatoes and composted animal manure. They then connected the trees to the ground with a web of vegetable plants and built dams and swales in the contours. For food they relied on ducks, chickens and pigs that ran wild and on what they could harvest from the landscape around them. The land was clear of weeds and, most importantly, they had the harvest to prove it worked.\n\nThe Moreton Bay fig tree.\n\nThe story goes that Bill Mollison was walking along a bush track in 1975 when he saw an old Moreton Bay fig tree. He was so impressed by it that he decided to take a picture of it, even though it was so common it was not considered worthy of conservation. Not long after, Bill and his family had to leave the country to avoid deportation. They took the photo of the fig tree with them. When they returned to Tasmania six months later, their new land was ready and the government was more than willing to grant them visas.\n\nBut what had happened to the old Moreton Bay fig tree? It was in a terrible condition, with no leaves, no new growth and not much hope for the future. Bill and his family decided to try something out that they had seen in Borneo. They let nature take its course and stopped all other work on the tree. For two years they did nothing at all, just let the tree do what it needed to do. At the end of the two years, they took another look at the tree. This time, the tree had leaves, buds and, for the first time in its life, it produced figs.\n\nBill Mollison and the old Moreton Bay fig tree.\n\nBill Mollison saw in this experience that nature will always seek a balanced system, provided that the human race allows it to do so. In fact, one of the core principles of permaculture is that we must stop manipulating nature and let it find its own solutions. “As long as you are using people to control nature, you are on a hiding to nothing,” Bill says. “We are all in the business of returning land to its native state.”\n\nThe outcome of Bill’s tree is very different"
"Two men who allegedly took part in a ring of thieves that stole up to $300,000 from Whole Foods stores in the Northeast have been indicted, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Thursday.\n\nJames Baggett, 49, of Manhattan, and Bryan C. Reed, 37, of Pennsylvania, allegedly stole from eight stores in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania by exploiting a software glitch, authorities said.\n\nIn a scheme that began in March 2013, a man would buy gift cards from the health food chain and, along with other accomplices, call to have them loaded with more money than they were worth.\n\nA New Jersey Whole Foods store is the target of a credit card skimming ring. (Barry Lewis / Staff Photographer)\n\nOne accomplice, who was arrested in December, used a prepaid card to load about $1,200 on a $100 gift card in the early part of 2013, authorities said.\n\nProsecutors said the thieves obtained nearly $200,000 by using the prepaid cards to load the accounts.\n\nProsecutors also said the men also took part in other scams, including one that involved an accomplice paying $1,400 for $5,000 in gift cards, getting $4,600 back from Whole Foods and then returning the gift cards.\n\nThat was part of a larger ring that netted nearly $1.4 million, authorities said.\n\nBaggett and Reed face charges of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, Bharara's office said.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey charged one of the alleged ringleaders of the gift card scheme.\n\nAuthorities said that between January 2013 and March 2014, Alberto Ayala of Newark stole $1 million from 16 Whole Foods locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nA Whole Foods store in the East Village is the target of a credit card skimming ring.

Zu diesem Ergebnis kommt eine Studie, die kürzlich im Fachmagazin „International Review of Economics“ veröffentlicht wurde.\n\nIn dem Artikel wurde festgestellt, dass reiche Leute eher dazu neigen, Staatsausgaben zu befürworten, die den Menschen helfen, die an den unteren Rängen des Gesellschaftssystems stehen. Der Ökonom Daniel Oesch von der Universität Fribourg fand diese Beobachtung anhand von Daten der Eurobarometer-Umfragen heraus.\n\nIn einer repräsentativen Erhebung zu den Lebensbedingungen in den Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union aus dem Jahr 2012 wurde gefragt, welche der folgenden drei Ansichten sie unterstützen:\n\n1. „Ich glaube, dass die Europäische Union eine starke soziale Union sein sollte, in der die finanziellen Mittel eingesetzt werden, um diejenigen zu unterstützen, die am meisten benachteiligt sind“.\n\n2. „Ich glaube, dass die Europäische Union eine starke politische Union sein sollte, in der die Mitgliedstaaten die politische Unabhängigkeit zugunsten eines vereinten Europas aufgeben sollten“.\n\n3. „Ich glaube, dass die Europäische Union eine starke wirtschaftliche Union sein sollte, in der eine politische Union mit einer Wirtschaftsunion verbunden werden sollte, damit eine weitgehende politische und wirtschaftliche Einheit entsteht“.\n\nIm Durchschnitt wurde der soziale Aspekt am stärksten von der Bevölkerung unterstützt. In nur acht der 34 Mitgliedstaaten wurde die politische Union mit einer wirtschaftlichen Union bevorzugt. Die Aussagen zu einer wirtschaftlichen Union lagen hingegen mit insgesamt 17 Prozent weit dahinter. Die am meisten unterstützten Forderungen waren die zum sozialen Aspekt und zur sozialen Union.\n\nIm Durchschnitt wurde der soziale Aspekt am stärksten von der Bevölkerung unterstützt.

Eine andere Studie hat zum Beispiel durchaus einen positiven Zusammenhang zwischen dem Einkommen und dem Interesse an sozialen Themen gefunden. Das Einkommen war bei den Befragten mit im Durchschnitt am höchsten mit der Wahrscheinlichkeit am höchsten, auf soziale Politik zu setzen. Der Grund für dieses Interesse liegt wohl darin, dass der besser Verdienende seinen Vorteil auch als Vorteil für andere sieht, anstatt nur seine eigene Interessenslage zu betrachten.\n\nDie Studie zeigt auch, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen Einkommen und der Unterstützung für soziale Politik stark mit der Einschätzung der ökonomischen Situation und der Zufriedenheit mit dem ökonomischen Zustand eines Landes zusammenhängt.\n\nDie Studie belegt auch, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen Einkommen und Unterstützung für soziale Politik mit einer Erhöhung des Einkommens abnimmt. Auch eine Erhöhung des Bildungsniveaus senkt den Zusammenhang.\n\nEine Erklärung für diesen Zusammenhang könnte in der Arbeitsbedingung und der Arbeitszeit der Person liegen.

"So i think that whoever is in control of communications for Theros Block should be fired. We are one week into the pre-release and this is how we have been treated thus far:\n\nThere has been no word on release dates for anything.\n\nIt has been confirmed that \"Theros, Master's Edition, and Born of the Gods\" will be the formats for the first PTQ season, and the only ones for the first year. The public reaction has been basically \"WTF?\"\n\nSo my question to Wizards is:\n\nWhat the hell were you thinking? Why would you do something so stupid? The current format is hardly stale, and yet you have already killed it with the same idiotic move that killed Extended, a move that should have been the first thing on your agenda. This move just keeps getting more and more idiotic, if that is even possible.\n\nIf the goal was to \"shake things up\" then why are you making things more stale? If anything, now is the time to switch to Modern, since Modern is no longer associated with Standard, but now Modern is associated with Extended!\n\nWhat about doing a limited release first? It would have been a fun way to get people excited about the new sets, and also an awesome way to sell sets.\n\nWhat about announcing the format of the PTQs at the same time you announce the pre-release dates? I know I would have enjoyed it more if I knew going into the pre-release what format I would be playing in a year's time.\n\nWhat is the point of a format that you only get to play for a year? That is not a format!\n\nThe reaction from the community was overwhelming negative. When was the last time Wizards did something that so united the community against it?\n\nWhat a waste of money, to do something so stupid. And you wasted the money of all of your loyal players who buy every set without fail, without even asking us. You could have asked us what we wanted. You could have asked us if we wanted a limited format in the block. You could have asked us what we thought about your ideas for the formats of the PTQs. You could have asked us if we liked the idea of an \"only-year\" format. You could have even asked us what we thought about a format that overlapped with the end of the previous one.\n\nInstead you did something that we hate without even asking us if we wanted it. I know that we would have told you \"NO!\"\n\nInstead, you have burned bridges and upset your customers. I know that I, for one, will never ever ever ever buy another pre-release pack. The format is absolutely irrelevant to me. I don't care what the format is, I only care that it is fun. I am happy with any format. I thought it was fun to play Modern Masters, and I think it would be fun to play Standard Masters. I would play anything you come up with. I just don't want to buy a pre-release pack if you are going to take away my format.\n\nWizards, please, listen to your community. We are your customers. You cannot afford to have us hate you. When you do things like this, you are alienating us. The most popular format at the pre-release was casual play, the people who do not care about the PTQs and only care about the draft. Wizards, listen to us! You are killing your brand!\n\nWe do not want to hate you. We love Magic. We have loved it for years, and have never regretted a single purchase. We want to keep loving it. We do not want to hate you. Please do not do this again. Do not alienate your loyal customers.\n\nPlease, Wizards, give us back our formats.<|endoftext|>Matt Drudge, the founder and editor of the Drudge Report, suggested Monday that President Trump will likely use Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election as an excuse to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions and shut down the Russia probe.\n\nThe Drudge Report, a conservative news aggregator, splashed a headline at the top of its site Monday that said, “MUELLER INDICTS PRESIDENT.”\n\nThe headline linked to a New York Post story that said that the special counsel’s report to the Justice Department could include an indictment of Trump.\n\nDOJ sources say the Mueller Report will likely not be good for President Trump… they also say the Mueller Report will likely not be good for President Trump… https://t.co/LcVlY5pQiP — MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) October 22, 2018\n\nDrudge followed the New York Post link by posting on his Twitter account that the special counsel’s report will be bad for the president.\n\n“DOJ sources say the Mueller Report will likely not be good for President Trump… they also say the Mueller Report will likely not be good for President Trump…,” he tweeted.\n\nDrudge has long warned about Sessions, a former Alabama senator, who is a target of conservatives who believe he has not been tough enough on immigration.\n\nDrudge, who reportedly speaks to Trump frequently, posted a story in July about Sessions’ sagging popularity among Republicans and said that if Trump does not replace him, the president will face a “massive revolt” from his base.\n\nA number of congressional Republicans have voiced their support for Trump firing Sessions.\n\nWhile Drudge did not mention Sessions by name in his tweet Monday, it comes at a time when speculation about the attorney general’s fate is at a fever pitch.\n\nSessions’ fate has been a point of discussion for more than a year. Trump often criticizes Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, which led to the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nOn Sunday, Sessions fired back at Trump for his relentless criticisms.\n\n“While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,” he said in a statement.<|endoftext|>\n\n\n\nOur products are made from solid wood, but you can't tell by looking at them!

For the scientific journal, see EPL (journal)\n\nEfflux is the term given to the movement of solutes (e.g., ions, metabolites, neurotransmitters) from an extracellular space back into a cell.\n\nIn biology\n\nIn living organisms, the movement of substances across cell membranes is determined by a delicate balance of processes. One of the most important of these is the ability of a cell to maintain a steady level of substances (e.g., ions, metabolites, nutrients, etc.) within itself. When this homeostatic equilibrium is perturbed, cells may take action to recover the equilibrium. If, for example, a cell's internal sodium level rises, this will trigger a mechanism to recover the normal concentration. Sodium is an essential nutrient and rising levels of it within a cell may be indicative of environmental changes that need to be dealt with.\n\nAt one time, it was thought that this process of the movement of substances out of a cell was governed by a unidirectional process known as the sodium pump. Sodium pumps move sodium out of a cell and into the extracellular space.\n\nResearch in the last decade has suggested that this model may be far too simple and that there is a complex network of transport mechanisms working together to achieve a relatively rapid restoration of equilibrium. Instead of a single mechanism, there may be a number of transport mechanisms involved, working in parallel and at various times. These mechanisms, collectively known as efflux, may be unidirectional, or they may involve the movement of both solutes and water across the membrane in either direction, depending on the circumstances. In this view, efflux is just one of several processes that can restore homeostasis to a cell, and it is no longer seen as a pump, but rather as part of a transport mechanism.\n\nIn pharmacology\n\nIn pharmacology, the term efflux is used in a different sense. Here, it is used to describe the expulsion of drugs from cells, e.g. efflux transporters. In this case, the term is often used to distinguish such expulsions from passive cellular membrane diffusion. The exact mechanisms for efflux can vary widely from one drug to another, although the most common mechanism involves the use of proteins known as ABC (ATP-binding cassette) efflux pumps.\n\nNotes\n\n^ Law of Mass Action, 1803 (Watt, 1803).<|endoftext|>It’s been a little over a week since the Champions League Final in Madrid, and the dust is just starting to settle on the fallout of it all. For me, I think I’m still in a state of ‘what just happened?’, that’s for sure. What was meant to be a triumphant end to my #UCL32 project (see my write-up here) has instead become an experience I’d really rather forget, thanks in part to Liverpool Football Club.\n\nI’ve done a bit of reading online about the debacle that went down at the end of the match and after reviewing some footage from the stands, it was crystal clear that a mistake was made by VAR, resulting in an unfair goal to Real Madrid, which ultimately led to them lifting the trophy. And, it doesn’t matter who is to blame for that or who is to blame for that mistake – it’s irrelevant now. This result has completely altered the perception of the match, and in the aftermath, everyone involved has received widespread criticism.\n\nIt’s not right to blame the referee, the assistants, VAR or UEFA for what happened – everyone involved did their best with the information and the situation at hand. So, in my view, Liverpool supporters (and, I know I’m not alone in this) should not be directing their ire towards any of them. Instead, it should be directed solely and squarely towards the players, who once again, failed to deliver on the biggest stage of them all. This is one time, I’m happy to say, that we (Liverpool supporters) got what we deserved – our team fell flat on their faces and to top it off, to be held responsible for this nonsense and face the criticism that we have is just a joke.\n\n“Everybody makes mistakes, VAR included” – the way the linesman or anyone else on the field could possibly say this is totally unacceptable is beyond me. How is it a mistake for VAR to fail to overturn a mistaken decision? This is the point where Liverpool supporters should be raging. VAR is meant to prevent this sort of thing from happening – to clear up these kinds of mistakes. If we can’t rely on VAR to make the right decision, then what’s the point?\n\nThe best thing that I can do is try and forget about it and move on. If I’m honest, I never felt we had much of a chance against Madrid, to be honest. I thought that they were just too good. After the game, we have to accept that Madrid are deserved champions and it’s time to take a look at ourselves, what we’ve done and what we can learn from this season.\n\nAs I’ve written elsewhere, I’ve no doubt that Liverpool will be back next season to challenge again. The overall playing quality in this squad is not what it was last season, however. That’s not to say that it isn’t very high – we saw how good the team is this season, despite the off-pitch distractions. However, it is just a fact that when you lose your best players and you don’t replace them adequately, then you’re going to be on the receiving end of the stick. In that sense, Klopp and the players have no one to blame but themselves for this season’s failure.\n\nThe Good\n\nNot a lot to say here. We’ve already spoken about how good the team was in this season’s Champions League, so it’s just as well that the good is minimal.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIn terms of the bad, it’s a lot to say, so here goes…\n\nThe team’s failure to show up on the biggest stage when it really mattered.\n\nWe didn’t score in the final for the first time in this season’s competition.\n\nWe conceded an own goal for the first time in this season’s competition.\n\nWe were beaten on the scoreboard by the eventual winners for the first time in this season’s competition.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van Dijk.\n\nThe attitude of the players.\n\nThe injury to Van D"

Trump says in his tweet that “we will not stand for this. Watch!”\n\nCanada has decided to protect their country by charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies. Not acceptable! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2018\n\nTrudeau told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that his government is prepared to “defend our industries and our workers” if need be.\n\nTrump has complained about Canadian dairy tariffs for years, and this week took the unprecedented step of singling out Canada when he threatened to impose tariffs on the imports of U.S. allies. He tweeted that “change is coming!”\n\nTrump wants to change the two-decades-old formula for pricing dairy products that leaves the U.S. with a trade deficit. It works like this: the U.S. exports milk protein concentrate, which Canada converts into a product used to make cheese. In return, the U.S. imports high-priced, ultra-filtered milk, a protein liquid concentrate used to make cheese.\n\nTrump tweeted Thursday: “Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!”\n\n…We will not stand for this. Watch! — Donald J.

With flavors of Vietnam and Thailand, there’s plenty to enjoy and keep you coming back. Plus, the atmosphere is lovely and fun with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to eat in or take out. The crispy tofu appetizer is especially addictive and not something you’ll find anywhere else in the city.\n\n\n\nLe Dragon:\n\nLe Dragon is a family-run spot on Amsterdam and 79th with some seriously authentic Asian cuisine. Everything is cooked to order, which means you’ll need to wait a few minutes to eat, but it’s well worth it. You’ll find a few small tables and lots of takeout orders but if you can grab a table, do it. The steamed buns are a great start (the pork is our favorite) and the crispy fish comes highly recommended. With classic Asian dishes like shrimp with cashew nuts and beef with broccoli, this is a spot where you can keep coming back for more.\n\n\n\nChinatown Supermarket:\n\nYou might pass by Chinatown Supermarket on the corner of Broadway and 76th Street and not give it a second look, but it’s actually a great resource for Asian ingredients and staples that you’ll need for the recipes you pick up from Le Dragon or the market next door. You can also buy a few delicious things to snack on from the grocery store, which also offers a hot food counter in the back of the store. The spicy squid and jian bing (Chinese crepes) are two of our favorites.<|endoftext|>Top Definition\n\nSucker born, sucker bred,\n\nSucker framed.\n\n\n\nThe gang leader decided to fight\n\nHis rival right in front of the bar.\n\nThe brawl was fast and furious\n\nBut the sucker never knew\n\nHe was being played\n\nBy the gang leader\n\n\n\nThere was a gangster by the name of Spuds,Sucker born, sucker bred,Sucker framed.The gang leader decided to fightHis rival right in front of the bar.The brawl was fast and furiousBut the sucker never knewHe was being playedBy the gang leader<|endoftext|>A petition to stop a wind farm near to a motorway has received more than 1,000 signatures.\n\nThe move follows a decision by the Scottish Government that the development at the Carrongrange wind farm would be granted planning permission.\n\nThis has prompted the petition, started by resident Julia Young, which says the proposed site is too close to the M9 motorway.\n\nThe petition says: “The M9 is in regular use by traffic travelling to and from Glasgow, Stirling and Edinburgh.\n\n“The noise from this type of wind farm has been shown to significantly reduce the quality of life of nearby residents.\n\n“The wind farm is near to a school, the River Forth, two residential estates and a visitor attraction.”\n\nSo far more than 1,000 people have signed the petition, and it aims to have more than 2,500 signatures.\n\nIf the petition gets that many signatures, it will be raised in the Scottish Parliament.<|endoftext|>It’s time to kick off another party week here on Holistic Squid and you all know what that means!

At the time of its closure it was the oldest mall in the province of Ontario, opening in 1967.\n\nIn June 2012, the roof of the mall collapsed.\n\nConstruction of the Elliot Lake Mall was completed in 1967, making it the oldest mall in the province of Ontario. The mall was one of two major projects in Elliot Lake that year, with the Elliot Lake General Hospital being the other. In 1986, the mall underwent a major expansion, expanding the number of retail units from 40 to 90, as well as doubling the size of the food court. At its peak, the Elliot Lake Mall had 100 retail stores and two anchor stores, Sears and Zellers, with an office for the mall's manager above Sears. However, when Zellers closed its doors on December 19, 2012, the mall's fate was sealed.\n\nOn June 23, 2012, the roof of the Elliot Lake Mall collapsed as a result of a large hole forming in the roof. The mall was subsequently closed indefinitely. The collapse led to a criminal investigation, as the roof had only a five-year lifespan and it was only five years old at the time of the collapse. On September 12, 2012, a $28-million class action lawsuit was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice by former mall tenants, accusing the mall's owner, Bob Nazarian, and the mall's engineering firm of negligence. The owner of the mall stated that the hole in the roof was caused by vandalism, and announced plans to rebuild the roof. On September 24, 2012, the City of Elliot Lake filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Ontario against Nazarian, seeking damages in the amount of $1.2 million. The City's lawsuit cited a litany of repair orders over the past few years for safety issues in the mall, and alleges that Nazarian failed to maintain the mall in a safe condition.\n\nIn November 2012, the owner of the Elliot Lake Mall released a statement to the media stating that plans were in place to remove the damaged sections of the roof and begin repairing the mall. This statement was followed by a class action lawsuit by former mall tenants on December 12, 2012. The lawsuit alleged that the mall was a death trap, and claimed that Nazarian was aware that the roof was dangerously unsafe but refused to take any action to make repairs. On December 17, 2012, Zellers, the last remaining anchor tenant, was locked out of the mall after their lease expired and they refused to pay a rent increase. The next day, the locks on the doors were changed and security guards were hired to guard the mall.\n\nOn December 19, 2012, Zellers closed its doors, leaving the mall vacant. On January 9, 2013, the province of Ontario ordered Elliot Lake Mall to be vacated due to safety concerns. The government stated that Elliot Lake Mall had become a public safety hazard due to the continued deterioration of the building, which was being caused by the presence of water and moisture. The government said that the building was still structurally sound, but added that the water and moisture was leading to the deterioration of the building.\n\nOn April 5, 2013, the City of Elliot Lake ordered that all residents within a radius of the mall evacuate, due to the risk of another roof collapse. A survey of the mall by experts from the United States Geological Survey and the University of Western Ontario determined that the roof was in a state of \"severe distress\". A report by the surveyors stated that, \"A collapse of the roof of the shopping centre would be expected to generate a potentially deadly and damaging blast event\". The report went on to state that if another collapse were to occur, it would likely result in a blast event which would cause \"considerable property damage\" and would most likely kill anyone in the immediate area. The report also went on to recommend that no one enter the building.\n\nFollowing this report, the owner of the mall announced that he had been given the go-ahead by a demolition expert to begin tearing down the portions of the roof that had collapsed. In an interview, the owner stated that he was unable to have the entire roof demolished due to the presence of asbestos in the roof. The owner also added that, due to a strict $300,000 budget that he had been given to demolish the roof, it would take several months to complete. He went on to say that the demolition would likely be completed by the end of the summer, but the mall would remain closed until he received the $14 million needed to complete the project.\n\nOn September 24, 2013, the owner of the mall made the decision to demolish the structure. Asbestos abatement, asbestos removal, and hazardous materials removal was conducted from October through December 2013, and demolition was completed in February 2014.\n\nIn January 2018, a new 25,000 square foot retail building was opened. It is the first of several new developments in the revitalization of Elliot Lake's downtown core.\n\n\n<|endoftext|>Étude Op. 10, No. 4 (Chopin)\n\nÉtude Op. 10, No. 4, in E major, is a technical study composed by Frédéric Chopin in 1830. It was first published as the fourth piece of his \"Études Op. 10\" in 1833. The piece is primarily used to develop and perfect the use of the third and fifth fingers. The piece is relatively easy, but to some it may present a challenge in the middle of the right hand section. The middle of the right hand section, for some, can be difficult because the shift in key can throw the pianist off.\n\nThis étude is in the key of E major, the relative minor of Chopin's native key of E minor. It follows the ABA form, with the central section being marked \"Allegretto\". The piece is mostly played with the third and fifth fingers.\n\nThe first page of this étude is an example of the common \"bariolage\" technique, in which two or more adjacent notes are alternated quickly with a melody note. The étude is also one of the many that, along with Op. 10, No. 5, uses the trill extensively.\n\n\"Étude Op. 10, No. 4\" is the most difficult piece in Chopin's étude Op. 10, and it can be considered the most difficult of his études altogether. This difficulty is due in part to the \"bariolage\" finger technique required, and also because the piece starts and ends in the wrong hand. The difficulty of the piece is also due to the usage of the two black keys that are not used in the first three études, which make it harder to transition into and out of the black keys. The black keys are not used in the first three études because they would confuse the students, but now, because the students have become more proficient, they are ready to use them. This is the reason why Chopin starts and ends the étude in the right hand, because it is the less accustomed to using the black keys. Some pianists, such as Nelson Goerner"

After the successful defeat of the Empire and the rescue of Han Solo, Luke set up a new Jedi Academy on Yavin IV. Luke realized that many of the Jedi had not had any formal training before the destruction of the first Death Star and had been turned to the dark side because of Palpatine. So, Luke set out to train these new Jedi, this new generation of Jedi. This new Jedi would be well trained and well educated in the ways of the Jedi Order.\n\nLuke's first student was his nephew, Jacen Solo. The grandson of Darth Vader had to be trained slowly, since Luke wanted to teach him about the Force and not just make him a Jedi. It took a few years, but Jacen eventually became a fully trained Jedi Knight.\n\nJacen and his cousin, Jaina, eventually went off on their own and formed a New Republic task force to hunt down Warlords and Dark Jedi that had been reborn after the Battle of Endor. It was this task force that resulted in the new lightsaber, since the first models were destroyed during their hunt.\n\nModels Edit\n\nThe first model of lightsaber was based on the standard lightsaber used in the years of the Old Republic, and that of the Jedi that followed. The blade was made of phrik, a metal that had been invented on the planet Phrik. The rest of the lightsaber was made of phrik, too. Luke also introduced a new lightsaber crystal, the adegan crystal. These crystals were found on the planet of Adega and had a deep, crimson color to them. The crystal had the ability to turn the blue of the blade to a crimson red, giving the blade a very sharp look.\n\nAfter a few years, the first model of lightsaber was replaced. A master lightsaber smith by the name of Beldris introduced the second model of lightsaber. The lightsaber was basically the same, but had a few differences. Beldris removed the grip that had been a part of the hilt of the lightsaber, since he felt that they slowed the duelist down too much. This new model also had a metal handle that ran up the entire hilt of the lightsaber and gave the lightsaber a slightly different look. The handle of the lightsaber was wrapped in a special cloth that was strong and flexible at the same time. The cloth was wrapped around the handle and wound down the hilt of the lightsaber. The tip of the hilt was a set of ten spikes, which gave the lightsaber a very nasty look. Beldris also created a new crystal that was inserted into the hilt of the lightsaber. This new crystal had a bluish green color and Beldris called it a Ion Crystal.\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin IV, Luke introduced a new lightsaber, which was also the last lightsaber model he created. Luke redesigned the lightsaber to look more like a normal lightsaber hilt, and removed the cloth from the handle. Instead, the handle was metal with small ridges going down the entire hilt. This new model also had a new kind of crystal, the sith alchemy crystal. This crystal was made by a Sith Lord named Darth Selus. Selus made this crystal to be deadly to Jedi, because he knew how strong the Jedi were. Selus infused the crystal with a deadly poison that, once it had been injected, could kill a Jedi in mere seconds. Luke also made the crystals to be slightly smaller than the other two crystals, so that duelists could choose which one they preferred.\n\nAs the galaxy moved forward, more people became attracted to the Jedi, and the duelists at the Jedi Academy needed more and more crystals. Since there was not enough of the Sith Alchemy crystals to go around, Luke decided to create a new kind of crystal that he called the Crixtis crystal. The Crixtis crystals were a greenish color and were much more easier to find, since they were mined in the world of Crixtis. Crixtis crystals were much smaller than the other two crystals, but were more powerful, although not as powerful as the Sith Alchemy crystal.\n\nThese crystals were the only crystals that could be used in the last model of lightsaber, the saberstaff. The saberstaff was basically a lightsaber that had two handles. One handle was on one side of the saberstaff, and the other handle was on the other side. The saberstaff came in handy for some Jedi, such as Luke, who would prefer to have a saberstaff with two handles.\n\nOver time, the duelists of the Jedi Academy would replace their crystal every year. This way, they had a crystal that was new, and their hilts would not be beat up from many duels.\n\nJedi Temples Edit\n\nAfter the war with the Yuuzhan Vong, a small band of Jedi began to form on Coruscant. These Jedi used the newly built Jedi Temple as their main meeting place. As the group grew in size, more and more Jedi came to Coruscant to use the temple. They also needed someplace to live, so they used an abandoned apartment complex on Coruscant. After the war, the apartments were deserted and the Jedi used them as their main place of living. After the Battle of Yavin IV, when Luke decided to train a new generation of Jedi, he took control of the temple, since the Jedi Council was no more. Luke decided to expand the temple, making it much larger. He also decided to make the apartment complex part of the temple, making the Jedi Temple one of the largest Jedi Temple in the galaxy.\n\nLuke decided to break the Jedi Academy off from the temple. He wanted the academy to have a different feel to it, since it would be the training ground for the new generation of Jedi. This is why the academy was built at Yavin IV.\n\nLuke Skywalker Edit\n\nThe creation of lightsabers was mostly due to Luke Skywalker, who knew that the Jedi had to be better trained. When Luke first joined the New Republic, he came with a lightsaber that was similar to the ones in the Old Republic. It had a blue crystal in the hilt, and had a yellowish green handle. It also had a long thin handle that curved around and came back down the hilt of the lightsaber. The handle was wrapped in a cloth, but not a leathery looking cloth, but a soft cloth that was somewhat like silk.\n\nThis lightsaber was used by Luke for quite a while, until he decided that he needed a better training lightsaber. This training lightsaber was the model that was used at the Jedi Academy, which was used to train new Jedi. This new lightsaber was used to train the new Jedi, and was kept as a lightsaber that was handed down from Master to Padawan.\n\nWhen the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Coruscant, Luke saw that it was a good time to test a new type of lightsaber. Luke realized that the Yuuzhan Vong had no Jedi on their side, so there was no reason to create a lightsaber that was specifically designed to defeat Jedi. Luke decided to redesign the lightsaber that he used on Yavin IV, to see how well the Yuuzhan Vong were affected by lightsabers. He was not sure if they would be affected at all, but Luke knew that he would have to train the new Jedi in the Jedi Academy differently than how it was done in the past. He was not sure if the Jedi should fight with lightsabers, or not.<|endoftext|>\n\nBy Carey Roberts\n\nFor most of the 20th century, California has prided itself on leading the nation into the future. The dream of Silicon Valley came to fruition when the technological revolution boosted the Golden State into the front ranks of global economic leadership.\n\nThat dream has recently become a nightmare.\n\nA majority of Californians appear to be on a progressive march into the past.\n\nThis trend is reflected in the mindset of young Californians.\n\nThe San Jose Mercury News reports that a quarter of millennials want to return to the days when divorce was illegal. Another 30 percent of millennials believe that interracial marriage should still be banned.\n\nA full half of young Californians wish that government mandated segregation, and a third say women should not have the right to vote. And about 20 percent of millennials favor requiring job applicants to pass a literacy test.\n\nIt is clear that the dreams of millennials are radically different than those of their baby boomer parents.\n\nFor example, the same poll shows that a quarter of millennials are opposed to free public schools, which has always been a core value in California.\n\nYoung Californians are also more likely than older residents to see illegal immigration as a major problem. And more than a third of millennials say that they are skeptical of so-called man-made climate change.\n\nThe political expression of this progressive backlash is the Bernie Sanders campaign, which is running rings around Hillary Clinton in the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\n\nHere in Orange County, the conservative region once home to Richard Nixon, old time conservatism is in a retreat before the advancing left.\n\nIn March, the Orange County Register published an editorial calling for the abolishment of the death penalty, which is opposed by the majority of Californians.\n\n“But even if California reinstated the death penalty, we doubt it would be meted out. More likely it would be a political football,” the paper said.\n\nAccording to the editorial, the criminal justice system is not so much"

(Karen Ducey/Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has been seizing the wages of undocumented workers and using the money to pay for its own operations.\n\nThe agency, best known for arresting, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants, collected $18 million in 2018 from a program called the “ERO Civil Enforcement Trust Fund,” according to documents obtained by CNN and published on Monday. The fund is used to “provide ICE with a source of funds to reimburse the costs of detention and removal,” according to an ICE document.\n\nIn a statement, ICE said that “all monies that are received are used to defray the expenses incurred while executing ICE’s mission.”\n\n“For example, money is used to pay for transportation of those in custody and to cover operational expenses at detention facilities and is used to offset detention costs for the states and localities that cooperate with ICE. ICE reimburses those jurisdictions for costs associated with the detention of criminal aliens in their custody,” the agency added.\n\nThe money also covers the salaries of the agents who arrest and detain people, the cost of obtaining travel documents, fees for public defenders, the cost of electronic monitoring, the cost of administering court proceedings and various other expenses, according to ICE.\n\n“ICE is in the business of immigration enforcement and detention, not deportations, and does not receive any taxpayer funding for the crucial work they do. On average, it costs between $50-75 per day to detain an individual,” ICE spokesperson Lori Haley said in a statement.\n\nICE seized $92 million in total from “a handful of” employers who illegally hired undocumented workers in 2018, according to CNN.\n\n“Funding for ICE is capped by Congress, and we can only ask for a fraction of what we need to do our job effectively,” ICE spokesperson Jennifer D. Elzea told The Washington Post in a statement. “We’re forced to make tough choices every day. It is not fair for individuals who violate our immigration laws to benefit from taxpayer dollars intended for law abiding citizens.”\n\nCongress does not set the amount that ICE can charge in wages or in seizing property.\n\nAccording to CNN, ICE seized $15 million from a family-run convenience store in California, $30 million from a Maryland construction company and $2 million from a plumbing business in Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants and civil rights called on Congress to put an end to the practice.\n\n“ICE has repeatedly violated federal law and courts have repeatedly rebuked them for doing so,” Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, told The Post in a statement. “The money that ICE is seizing from immigrants is often the very money that is keeping them and their families off the street. These funds could be used to pay rent, put food on the table, or buy shoes for their children.”\n\n“Congress needs to put a stop to this abuse and pass the No Money for Deportation Act immediately,” he added.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Democratic Reps. Mark Pocan (Wis.) and Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), would prohibit ICE from seizing a person’s property “unless there is reasonable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture and that the owner or person from whom the property was seized used the property in a manner that made it subject to forfeiture.”\n\nICE has long been criticized for going after the wages of undocumented workers.\n\nA 2011 report from the National Employment Law Project found that such programs had a “devastating effect on low-income families, separating mothers and fathers from their children, stripping them of their right to work and leaving them destitute.”\n\n“In fiscal year 2008, more than 15,000 workers and their families were denied more than $16.8 million in wages,” the report said.\n\nTrump made promises to crack down on illegal immigration during his campaign. But while illegal border crossings have decreased dramatically since he took office, his administration has embraced ICE as an agency dedicated to immigration enforcement.\n\nLast year, the administration authorized the agency to arrest more people without any criminal history and without first being given the authority by a judge.\n\nThe Post’s Maria Sacchetti reported that the agency “targeted 30 percent more people for deportation in the 2018 fiscal year than in the year before, with the biggest increase in immigrants who had committed no crimes beyond their immigration offenses.”\n\nBut the administration has also struggled with the long-term cost of detaining migrants. The cost of housing a migrant in a detention facility for a single day was estimated at $129 in 2017.\n\n“It’s a financial decision,” one Department of Homeland Security official told The Post in November. “The money is better spent elsewhere.”\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to accurately reflect ICE’s overall budget for fiscal year 2019. The agency’s budget is $7.3 billion.<|endoftext|>China is working on a new jet trainer that could be used to replace the JJ-7 Flanker.

I guess I’m a simple man. A simple man with a fondness for netrunner cards and digital art. While the cards themselves are only a small part of the game and often not even seen when playing, they’re the cards that start it all. The art is a big part of what attracts me to Netrunner. The crisp, bold designs that can also evoke feelings or tell stories. While I don’t play much anymore, I still enjoy going back to browse through these cards. So why not share some of the best in our Art Of… series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time we’re doing another twist on the series by not going for a specific set, instead we’re just looking at a selection of cards that all fall under the All That Remains expansion. A popular set that brought the art of Shouta Yasooka to the community. Shouta’s unique style of art captures the feel of the source material perfectly and comes across well in card form. All that remains really captures the essence of cyberpunk and provides the best of the theme as it should. If you’re interested in more from Shouta you can check out his gallery page and follow him on Twitter. He’s an amazing artist and we’re very lucky to have him.\n\nFirst off we have a staple in most netrunner decks – Corroder. I feel it was a great design choice for the ice to not only use the cutting through concept but also to keep the design clean and easy to read. The crisp lines really make it stand out and the subtle white detail behind the lines really work in creating the effect. This one really did jump out to me as a card that I was really happy to see and it helped create the whole idea of netrunner in the first place.\n\nZer0 is another great looking card. It perfectly illustrates the concept behind the character, as well as the nature of netrunner. The shadows, the gear and the very simple but effective colours all come together to form an impressive image. My only criticism is the green glow in the characters helmet. I don’t think it works well with the rest of the design and it’s just a little too much for my liking. Overall though it’s a great card.\n\nHere we have another great look at Shouta’s style. It has a classic look to it, not too complex but still complex enough to tell the story. It really does look like a worn newspaper. I’ve never actually played the original game it’s based on, which makes it even more impressive. I guess it’s time for me to go and play some D&D, as that’s exactly what this card evokes.\n\nThis is another favourite of mine. Shouta has a great way of depicting robots in a way that captures the soul of the robot but also the strength of a hardworking labourer. It’s this style that I really enjoy and is the main reason why I wanted to do this post.\n\nOne last card before I go. I know it’s a card that’s not as great, it’s a little weird, but I just really like the idea behind it. The art isn’t great but I really like the concept behind it. The biggest problem is the actual detail of the image. The box is a great idea but the sharp edges are too much for me. Again, this is an issue with the style of the artist. I really love the idea of it, I just don’t think it’s executed well enough.\n\nAll That Remains is a great expansion. One that I think a lot of us can agree on. It may be my bias towards Shouta’s work but I just think it�"

This is why it is so important that we continue the effort to instill the values of democracy, freedom, tolerance, and equality, which are the foundation of Russia’s policy.”He added that anti-Semitism, along with xenophobia, racism, homophobia and other forms of intolerance, are unacceptable.Lauder, who visited Russia in May 2015, said at the time that the Russian government had done more than most to facilitate the security of Jewish communities in the country.He praised Putin for leading an international effort to defeat the Islamic State terrorist organization.During a panel discussion in Moscow at the time, Lauder said Putin deserved much credit for his work in securing the removal of the chemical weapons stockpile in Syria from the control of President Bashar al-Assad, where they were being used to kill civilians.Russia, Lauder added, also is making a significant effort to combat anti-Semitism, especially among Russians on the internet.Putin hosted Lauder in December of 2015 when he attended a concert of the Jewish Charity Band in Moscow, where the Russian president showed his knowledge of Jewish customs, telling the audience that challah, the traditional bread eaten by Jews on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, is made with honey, not sugar.<|endoftext|>I found an older copy of the Windows NT TCP/IP Stack documentation at the MSDN web site. This was really useful since it describes the more advanced options for tuning the stack. The first thing to change is the default socket buffer sizes for each type of socket. The socket buffer size can be changed for all sockets by using the registry. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DefaultSendWindowSize (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DefaultTTL (DWORD) The TCP/IP Stack has two possible implementations. The default is the ATL implementation. This is the preferred implementation since it has the most current security enhancements. The alternate implementation is the Winsock implementation. It can be accessed using the \"Advanced\" tab on the \"TCP/IP\" properties page. There are a couple of different parameters you can adjust in this dialog box. In order to increase the size of the buffers, change the \"Send Buffer Size\" and the \"Receive Buffer Size\". By default the send buffer is 4096 and the receive buffer is 8192. If you don't see the \"Advanced\" tab, you may need to download the Internet Explorer 4.0 patch from the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit at the MSDN web site. To change the buffer sizes using the registry, use the following information. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\VxD\\MSTCP\\Parameters\\SendBufferSize (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\VxD\\MSTCP\\Parameters\\ReceiveBufferSize (DWORD) This is the maximum size of data that can be sent over a TCP socket. It does not include TCP headers. The default size for this is 65536 (64K). This registry setting can be changed by accessing the Advanced tab on the TCP/IP properties page. The default is a value of 8192. This is the amount of data that can be received by the TCP stack before it is passed up to the protocol layer. The default value is 8192. This is the minimum size of data that can be sent or received by the TCP stack. The default value is 2048. When tuning these parameters, it is important to make sure that the window size is larger than the default size. If not, it will cause the TCP stack to retransmit data. The default is a value of 2048. This registry entry specifies the default maximum receive message size in bytes that a TCP/IP application can receive over a TCP/IP socket. The default value is 16384. This entry specifies the default maximum send message size in bytes that a TCP/IP application can send over a TCP/IP socket. The default value is 16384. This registry entry specifies the maximum size of a receive window in bytes for an application using the Winsock TCP/IP implementation. The default value is 16384. This registry entry specifies the maximum size of a send window in bytes for an application using the Winsock TCP/IP implementation. The default value is 16384. The default value is 4. If you change this value, you should verify that the TCP window size is larger than this value. Otherwise, you may experience retransmission. The default value is 4. If you change this value, you should verify that the TCP window size is larger than this value. Otherwise, you may experience retransmission. There are some registry entries that can be used to tune the TCP/IP stack that have no UI in the Advanced TCP/IP properties page. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DefaultTTL (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\Tcp1323Opts (DWORD) This registry entry specifies the use of the 1323-byte segmentation option. The default value is zero, which specifies that the 1323-byte segmentation option is disabled. This registry entry specifies the use of the ECE (early connection establishment) option. The default value is zero, which specifies that the ECE option is disabled. This registry entry specifies the use of the advanced window scaling option. The default value is zero, which specifies that the advanced window scaling option is disabled. This registry entry specifies the use of the performance options. The default value is zero, which specifies that the performance options are disabled. This registry entry specifies the use of the retransmission timeout. The default value is zero, which specifies that the retransmission timeout is disabled. If you change any of these values, it is very important to verify that the TCP window size is larger than this value. Otherwise, you may experience retransmission. It is also important to make sure that the values of all the parameters are consistent. The following registry entries can also be used to tune the TCP/IP stack, but they don't have a UI in the Advanced TCP/IP properties page. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisablePMTUDiscovery (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisablePMTUBHDetect (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableRecordRoute (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableSelectiveSACK (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableSACK (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableSACKToSACK (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableSelectiveAck (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableTimeStamp (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableWindowScaling (DWORD) HKEY_LOCAL_"
"| Street View\n\nThe Victory Theatre was opened in 1920. It was located in downtown North Adams, MA in the most prestigious block in the city. It was a 1300 seat theatre. A night in the Victory Theatre was a popular event. Comedians like Henny Youngman, Red Buttons, Eddie Albert, and Milton Berle headlined many shows. There were also classical music concerts with performers like Lawrence Tibbett, Jose Iturbi and Pablo Casals. It was also used for the occasional play and movie premiere.\n\nThe Victory Theatre closed in 1965. It was converted into a movie theater in 1965, but went dark in 1966.

"Ducati Diavel Carbon\n\nDucati Diavel Carbon\n\nBike Test:\n\nMotorcyclingPlus editor Mitch Boehm goes head-to-head with Ducati’s super-sporty cruiser in this stunning full test and video\n\nEver since it was announced that Ducati was to enter the super-sport cruiser market, there have been the inevitable cries of ‘How dare they?’ from those who claim the move is ‘sacrilege’. The true Ducatisti have long seen their beloved marque as an almost sacred institution, a collection of motorcycles that are beautifully engineered and a real art form in themselves. But they don’t make millions of euros from the mass market.\n\nDucati realised that it was time to change.\n\nAt EICMA 2010, Ducati announced a whole new range of cruisers – the Streetfighter, Streetfighter S, Streetfighter 848, Multistrada 1200, Monster 1100 and the Diavel. The range is superbly engineered and oozes technical and aesthetic appeal – the bikes look utterly stunning, each being totally individual in character.\n\nThe Diavel is the most revolutionary of the bunch. It takes the hyper-performance of the Monster 1100 and fuses it with the character and attitude of a more traditional, larger displacement bike. What it is not is the standard Diavel, which has no footrests and looks totally hardcore.\n\nThe Diavel Carbon is powered by the same 160bhp Testastretta 11° v-twin as the Streetfighter and Streetfighter S, and also shares its brakes and suspension, though the suspension is set up to be more road biased. Its 43mm inverted fork is from the Multistrada and the frame and swingarm are both light, to reduce unsprung weight.\n\nFreed from the back of the bike and lengthened in a move reminiscent of the original Monster, the 1100cc Testastretta engine is probably the best v-twin ever. From a smooth idle it pulls hard all the way to its 16,500rpm redline, with a massive wave of torque, great midrange performance and a top end that has the Diavel sprinting away from the line like an animal. It makes a glorious noise, too, with a deep, gruff V-twin growl and a really mellow note that will make anyone grin.\n\nThat low-down torque is perfect for town riding, too, with easy pick-up, and combined with the Diavel’s lightweight frame, makes it easy to wheelie everywhere. You can get both wheels up off the ground with the front, or the rear and front together, making it an entertaining and easy bike to hoon around town, or in a straight line at the racetrack.\n\nThe rear suspension was the one weak link in the package on the day I rode the Diavel Carbon. When the bike was stood on its nose, there was a fair amount of dive, which was amplified under braking. This means that the rear end would sink in on deceleration and the front end would dive a bit. This wasn’t too much of a problem for slow speeds, but at speed on a tight racetrack, it became a little annoying.\n\nEven on the racetrack, though, the Diavel Carbon is a real joy to ride. On the road, it was smooth and forgiving with good front-end feel. At high speeds, the Ducati’s geometry creates a good compromise between agility and stability, while its superb stability and composure at speed means it’s the perfect tourer.\n\nThe Ducati Diavel Carbon is a superb motorcycle and is almost a totally different motorcycle to its hardcore sibling. In fact, Ducati could easily have gone for a totally different name for the motorcycle as it is quite distinct from the standard Diavel, being more refined and more usable. If you’re in the market for a touring bike, or a comfortable sports bike that can handle a twisty back road with ease, then this should be at the top of your shopping list.\n\nFor more on the new Ducati Diavel Carbon, visit: www.motorcyclenews.com<|endoftext|>Read an Excerpt\n\nPoisoned Chalice\n\nWarhammer 40,000\n\nBlack Library\n\nCopyright © 2005\n\nWarhammer 40,000\n\nAll right reserved.\n\nISBN: 1-84416-435-6\n\nChapter One\n\nThe Red Rage\n\nThe Cadian Gate is perhaps the most vital defensive point of the Imperium of Man. The system of Cadian, in the Segmentum Obscurus, has been a bastion against the horrors of the Eye of Terror for millennia. Stretching like a great curved sword from the northern rim of the Eye of Terror to the world of Cadia, the Cadian Gate marks the dividing line between the Eye and the rest of the galaxy. It is through the Cadian Gate that the armies of the Imperium have made their stand, and it is here that the forces of the Traitor Legions and the Forces of Chaos make their bid for the prize of Terra. The Cadians are proud and have a reputation for being implacable in defence. This is not only true of the soldiers, but also of the population of the world of Cadia itself. The people of Cadia, through their history, have become renowned for their staunchness and refusal to bend or give way. It is a sign of their fighting spirit that when the Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka was driven off Cadia in 946.45.M41, the Cadian High Command paid an Ork warband to make sure Ghazghkull's armada departed the system, rather than having them blasted out of the stars. The Imperial fleet refused to go into battle against the Space Orks unless Ghazghkull had left the system first.\n\nBut Ghazghkull is far from the most deadly enemy Cadia has faced. Even before the Fall of Cadia, the Cadian Gate had been a place of bloodshed and horror. After the Horus Heresy, a great fleet of Traitor warships, remnants of the broken Imperial forces fleeing the destruction of the battles at Terra and on the world of Isstvan V, had been caught in the Cadian System. The flight of the survivors of the shattered battlefleets had been aided by the actions of the frigate Eisenstein, but when the Eisenstein, after a narrow escape from the forces of Chaos, reached Cadia and the Imperial forces under the command of the newly promoted Lord Solar Macharius, the armada had been close to destruction. The forces of Chaos had been driven off, but the Battle of the Cadian System had been long and bloody.\n\nWhen Macharius was ready to move on to the Isstvan System, the massive armada moved out, but the infighting amongst the Traitor Legions left the survivors a shadow of their former selves. Macharius's armada was ready for battle. Victory followed victory as the Imperium took back all of the Traitor-held worlds in the Isstvan System and recovered the scattered and shattered remnants of the Sons of Horus. Once more, it seemed that the power of the Legions was broken and that the Legiones Astartes would soon be a thing of the past. The victory of the Cadian Gate was of enormous importance.\n\nThe Chaos hordes were driven back to the Eye of Terror. Once more, the warp storms began to abate and, gradually, a period of relative calm descended. Once more, the defenders of the Cadian Gate breathed easily and rejoiced.\n\nIt is to the Cadian Gate that those humans of the Imperium who are under a curse and who live in the Eye of Terror are sent. This curse comes from the power of Chaos itself. It infects the very minds of those who oppose the great Traitor Legions. Soon, the will of the servant of Chaos is bent to the will of the Dark Gods. Soon, the battle is over, and the servant is one of the servants of Chaos. This is the fate of many who find themselves on the fringes of the Eye of Terror, where a mysterious power of Chaos lingers, and where the empyrean energy of the Immaterium intrudes into the physical universe. The curse is transmitted through the aura of those who have been touched by Chaos, or who have travelled to the Eye of Terror in the form of a Chaos space marine. This curse can also be transmitted by the touch of a Chaotic daemon, or through psychic powers. Once a human has received the curse, there is no hope for redemption. They have doomed themselves.\n\nThe majority of the people who live in the Eye of Terror are cursed with a single-minded desire to do harm to all that opposes them. In those who have been affected by Chaos, this becomes the uncontrollable urge to hurt and to kill, and this urge will lead the individual to seek out the opposing army and take part in the fighting. Some people, though, are struck by a second curse, which will lead them to seek out their own side. If a person should seek to betray his own army, and turn it to Chaos, then the curse grows in power. The Chaos Gods will reward such a person by granting him a measure of their power, and they will make him a daemon, a Daemon Prince, the servant of Chaos and a terrible opponent. It is a dark path to the darkness, but it is one that many humans walk, and one that many will go on to repeat until they are strong enough to destroy their own kind.\n\nOf course, the Daemon Princes who have been formed by this process are the greatest warriors"
"Not so long ago, one would only see the “dirtiest” of the “dirty” stuff around this time of year. No longer!\n\nIn the old days, one would have to actually go into a store and find the games marked down to unappealing prices, as they usually were around this time of year. It would be common to see piles of unappealing PS2 games, unopened Nintendo DS games, even remakes of classics for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo.\n\nNowadays, this is an every day occurrence, but what was really worth noting was that on December 15th and 16th, both Amazon and Walmart actually had two different systems being sold at deeply discounted prices.\n\nWalmart was selling a special collector’s edition of Halo 4 for $40. This was also a very popular game when it came out, so this was quite an impressive price. I’m a little bummed that I missed this deal, as I am a huge Halo fan.\n\nAmazon was selling the 2nd edition of the PlayStation 3 Super Slim for $185.00, or $80 off the original price. The reason why this was significant is that the 2nd edition of the PS3 had very little improvement over the original model, but a lot of people seemed to buy them anyway. It appears that Amazon is trying to clear them out before they announce the newest PlayStation 4 console, which will most likely be available for sale at Christmas.<|endoftext|>Wicca covens are sometimes known as 'sisterhoods', 'sister circles', 'sister groups', 'covens' or 'circles', and may consist of a handful of members or hundreds, as the situation warrants. These groups of Wiccan witches are organized to achieve a common purpose, which may include the following.\n\n- learning and practicing magic\n\n- celebrating the eight Wiccan festivals\n\n- assisting a member in need\n\n- celebrating the Sabbats\n\n- performing a spell or ritual for a friend, relative, or member of the coven\n\nThe Wiccan coven consists of a High Priestess, a High Priest, and their trainees. The coven members worship the God and Goddess through their rituals, ceremonies, and festivals. They see these as expressions of the sacred power of the Universe.\n\nWiccan covens operate as autonomous spiritual groups with each coven under the leadership of a High Priestess and High Priest, who are usually the leaders of the coven. It is usually up to the covens to determine their structure, rules, and size.\n\nWithin a coven, there may be two or more leaders. However, the High Priestess is generally the senior leader and it is she who sets the policies, rules, and rituals of the coven. She also has the final say in any decision that may need to be made.<|endoftext|>Amazing ideas for reviving a bathroom vanity can be the awesome bathroom storage ideas.

You can check which you need by looking at the directions for your RX. If it doesn't say then you need to just do a voltage check. To do this power on the Kinekt, place the throttle stick to low and the trim to full back. Measure the voltage between the 5V and GND pads. It should be somewhere around 5V. If it is then you are good to go with the Orange FC. If it isn't then you are going to need the Black FC.\n\nAs far as compatible flight controllers go you can pretty much use whatever you want. There is a list on the website for specs. I've only used the EMAX and the Flip32's but both work well. All of the frames are the same but there are 2 options for the flight controller.You can go with the Base or Pro.The Base comes with the Orange FC, the Pro comes with the Black FC.The difference between the two FC's is that the Base uses a non-inverted SBUS, and the Pro is inverted. You can check which you need by looking at the directions for your RX. If it doesn't say then you need to just do a voltage check. To do this power on the Kinekt, place the throttle stick to low and the trim to full back. Measure the voltage between the 5V and GND pads. It should be somewhere around 5V.

"Globe Telecom and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) have agreed to a share swap which would transfer majority control of Digitel Mobile Philippines (DMPC) to the incumbent telco.\n\nGlobe and PLDT said in a joint statement on Monday that they had signed a share exchange agreement to transfer all outstanding shares of PLDT to Globe in exchange for a combination of Globe shares and cash, totaling up to P67.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) at the current exchange rate.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Globe would take majority control of DMPC, which owns and operates the Talk ‘N Text brand of mobile services. The Philippines’ Supreme Court recently allowed PLDT to exercise its right to full control over DMPC. PLDT owned 53.49 percent of DMPC and Globe owned 46.51 percent.\n\nA Globe executive said the PLDT deal would allow Globe to gain a large increase in customers, but would not directly result in a large increase in capital expenditure.\n\nThe transfer of PLDT shares to Globe would trigger a mandatory tender offer to acquire the shares that it did not already own in DMPC. Globe would offer to pay P9.95 per share in cash or about P2.1 billion (US$41.7 million) for the shares that it did not already own in DMPC.\n\nOnce the mandatory tender offer had been accepted by PLDT, Globe would own 94.24 percent of DMPC.\n\nThe transfer of PLDT shares to Globe would be followed by the compulsory redemption by PLDT of shares in DMPC which it did not already own.\n\n“In the aggregate, the PLDT shares that are being acquired by Globe and the compulsory redemption of PLDT shares in DMPC would result in the redemption of 76.95 percent of the outstanding shares of DMPC,” Globe said.\n\nThe two telcos said the transaction would allow them to resolve “certain legal and regulatory issues with respect to the relationship between PLDT and DMPC and between PLDT and Globe.”\n\nThese issues included the rights of Globe to access to, and the use of, PLDT’s network facilities and infrastructure.\n\nThe deal was expected to be completed within the first quarter of next year.<|endoftext|>Description\n\nBermuda's colonial past is portrayed through its national folk heritage and architecture.

The function of this venerable space is to mediate between the private and public worlds: it is an anchor to family tradition and the cradle of private life, yet it is also a place where the outside world finds its way in, a place where the intimate sphere of homecoming is shared by the activities of daily life and the ritual occasions of public gatherings. Public life is played out in private, in the dressing rooms and dining rooms, libraries and billiard rooms.The house has its own discourse, too, its own history of drama and tragedy, its own gossip, hearsay, scandal, public secrets, and secrets kept from public view. If the characters play out their lives in an old house, they play out their secrets in one another. Housekeeping is a complex affair of domestic self-concern and social self-concern. Henry James's housekeeping motifs are complex, too, for the very \"good, sound old house\" may have a \"dusky, devouring heart,\" and, as he wrote in a letter, a \"familiar, grotesque\" face.The housekeeping motifs in The Golden Bowl set a dramatic stage for his characters' maneuvers. As James conceived it, this novel would be a \"play\" (that is, the domestic stage, a small one for a small cast), the action of which would unfold, in separate acts, \"through the rooms and passages of a great house\" (HJL 3: 394). A house of action in itself, it would provide a suitable setting for a drama of human self-knowledge. The opening of the novel, we are told, takes place in the winter of 1904, and the principal characters are three American cousins, Kate Croy, Charlotte Stant, and Prince Amerigo, in England to take part in the festivities of the coronation of Edward VII. On a dark and stormy night, the cousins walk from their London hotel to the house of the Duchess of Portland, where they are invited to spend the night before traveling to the country the next day.When they reach the house, they come upon two people in the entry hall. These are the Duchess, her niece Fanny Assingham, and her nephew Mr. Ralph, whom we learn is Mrs. Assingham's husband. Kate and Charlotte have been told they will not be housed in the same rooms as Mr. and Mrs. Assingham, and Ralph, who is sleeping in the same room with his wife, is explaining to her why he objects to this. In the dining room beyond them, we hear the Duchess saying to the other guests that she has been sitting at a table for twelve and that in consequence she had to leave out Mr. Assingham. This situation creates a sense of mystery about Assingham. He will soon take on more importance, for he is soon to become a major character. Yet we will never hear his voice. As the novel opens, his speech is disembodied, as if he has been dropped out of the narrative altogether. Like the rest of the dinner party, we never hear the sound of his voice, and, when he is referred to, it is always in the third person. This detachment from the dinner party lends a sense of mystery and horror to his appearance, which in turn becomes an indication of the power of the Duchess to render people silent. To the cousins, Mr. Assingham seems a blank, yet their own blankness soon becomes visible to them, and it will never be entirely erased from their self-consciousness.With this first sighting of the house, the dramatic stage is set: the dinner party is private, but it is played out in a house of public consequence. The mysterious appearance of Mr. Assingham, for example, puts the cousins on notice that they may be in the company of royalty. \" 'Royalty,' Mr. Assingham remarked, however, appeared to have been sufficiently provided for\" (HJL 2: 130). Mr. Assingham is a frequent narrator in the novel, and his role is to provide explanations and clarify what we don't understand. The dinner party gives no clue about who is present, and, at the end of the evening, we are told that Mr. Assingham is the only guest \"of whom it was publicly known\" (HJL 2: 136). What this means, however, is that he is the only guest of whom the Duchess of course knows, for all of the others are in the house in order to keep up appearances for the coronation festivities. Moreover, the presence of royalty does not lend any clarification to the evening. The evening itself is a screen behind which are hidden the motives and desires of the characters, and it is only by tracking these and bringing them to the surface that we can begin to understand their plots. (This is not a novel of action; it is one of plot and counterplot.) Assingham's explanation, which has no authority, is one of the many statements made in this opening scene which the novel will go on to reveal as misrepresentations. The room the cousins find themselves in is dark, and we will later learn that the \"desolation of the scene\" (HJL 2: 138) has to do with more than the weather.The novel's dramatic space will go on to provide a rich set of patterns for James's narrative imagination, and its plot will move inexorably from one house to another, in a narrative arc which begins at the old country house and ends at the newer house, between the cousins and between Kate and Amerigo. In between is the Grand Babylon Hotel, a transitional space where there is a profusion of guests and at which the old space begins to give way to the new. The Grand Babylon will not end the \"old, obscure, sinister\" (HJL 4: 366) social customs of the old country house, but it will not give up its privileges either. The Royal Hotel, which Kate and Charlotte go to stay at after their stay at the Duchess of Portland's, is in the same old London neighborhood, yet it is different in that it is more modern, more spacious, more public.The Hotel du Mond is a \"high and light\" (HJL 5: 20) space, and yet it is the site of the final confrontation. Its public space will provide the scene for the couple's confrontation with public society and the space within it, the scene for their encounter with their father. It is a space whose irony will become part of the problem of self-knowledge. The Hotel du Mond has the theatrical atmosphere of a large public space, and yet it will also have the theatricality of a stage set, as it becomes the locus for the drama of recognition. At the same time, the hotel is a set for a tragedy and a set of scenes for a comedy. It is the site of a tragic death and of a comic scene of recognition. It is the modern form of the \"grand old country house,\" where the private and the public are constantly juxtaposed.There are many other houses in the novel, some of which may seem to be"

He turned and flashed the spotlight over the rear end of the train. He saw nothing.\n\nHe got up and walked to the lounge window, pulled aside the curtains and peered into the night. The roadbed was all right. The cars looked okay. He could see the red tail light of the caboose, just where it should be.\n\nHe glanced at the gas gauge. It was low, but not dangerously so. The big diesel was pounding along at the rate of forty miles an hour, the usual speed.\n\n“No trouble,” he murmured. “Nothing wrong.”\n\nHe dropped the curtain, returned to the control seat and concentrated on his driving. His speed went up to forty-five, and still he felt no loss of power. But gradually he became aware of a loud, unusual noise.\n\n“Like the high-pitched screaming of a police whistle,” he said later. “Like nothing I ever heard before.”\n\nHis speed dropped back to forty.

But now, with a thunderous crashing and grinding, the big steel wheels began to turn wildly, off the rails, then back on again.\n\nFor a few moments the coach swayed violently from side to side. Chauffeur could do nothing but cling to the wheel. The engine, still roaring and chugging, dragged the coach off the track, then back again.\n\nAt the end of each swaying, Chauffeur got a quick glimpse of the caboose. He saw the red light jerk in a crazy pattern, side to side, front to back.\n\nAnd now the whistlelike noise was louder than ever, a deafening screaming that seemed to drive him back against the wheel.\n\nThe left side of the coach went down, then the right, and suddenly the wheels were off the rails and the whole train was plunging, off the tracks, down an embankment.<|endoftext|>Contrairement aux autres pays du continent africain, la Libye est une république dotée d’institutions démocratiques et politiquement très libres.

If you plan to create an additional bedroom, a formal living room, a dining room or a home office, you have to check the size and any of your local or city housing laws. In most cases, you have to add enough square footage to the property to allow for the additional room.\n\nFinding The Minimum Size Your local housing laws provide the minimum size for all bedrooms, dining rooms and living rooms. To determine the minimum size, you need to know the number of occupants of your property. In most cases, you have to provide 150 square feet of space for each occupant of a home or apartment. In addition, you have to provide sufficient space for a bed, bureau, desk, chair and at least one window.\n\nNew Spaces In most cases, a master suite requires a minimum of 250 square feet. The extra 50 square feet is required because a bathroom typically has at least 150 square feet of floor space. In most cases, your local housing laws don't require the entire property to be at the minimum size, but you need to provide enough square footage to accommodate each of the additional rooms. For example, if you need to add a new bedroom or an office, you have to provide the space for the bed, bureau, desk and window. In addition, you have to provide the minimum square footage for a living room, dining room and a kitchen.\n\nPlanning For The Future You might decide to add a formal living room, dining room and home office to your property because you want to lease the property out, but if you are just adding a new space because you have room, you can still rent the extra space to a tenant. In fact, you could even rent it out to your current tenant. For example, if you decide to add an additional bedroom and rent it out to the person who is already living in your home, you can charge the tenant for the additional bedroom.\n\nTips If you are converting a bedroom or office to a dining room, you will need to provide a minimum of 40 square feet of space, but you don't need to provide the other 50 square feet if you want to create a dining room. In most cases, you don't need to provide a home office, but you need to provide at least 70 square feet of space to convert a dining room into a home office.\n\nAbout the Author Larry Simmons is a freelance writer and expert in the fusion of computer technology and business.

It ultimately led to the resignation of President Nixon and prison terms for his top aides.\n\n\"It's frankly disgusting that the media is taking a meeting that should have nothing to do with any of us, and turning it into the world's biggest story,\" Trump Jr. tweeted.\n\nTrump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday that revealed he was eager to accept damaging information from the Russian government about Hillary Clinton that would be provided by a \"Russian government attorney.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's eldest son released a series of emails on Tuesday that revealed he was eager to accept damaging information from the Russian government about Hillary Clinton that would be provided by a \"Russian government attorney.\" AP Photo/Andrew Harnik\n\nThe emails, from June 2016, show that he was told the Russian government had information that could \"incriminate\" Clinton and her dealings with Russia. He was told the information was \"very high level and sensitive\" but was \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n\n\"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\" Trump Jr. responded to the intermediary offering the information. He then released the exchange on Twitter, a move that quickly drew the attention of investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia to interfere in the election.\n\nAccording to the emails, the meeting with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya never actually happened.

First, let me just start out by saying IntelliScreenX 3 is NOT out yet, so these results are from the 3.0 beta that just recently hit Cydia.\n\nIf you are not familiar with IntelliScreenX, it is a tweak that does a lot. In fact, it’s description says it all:\n\nIntelliScreenX™ is an iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad information app designed to replace the functionality of the “notch”, or status bar, located at the top of iOS devices. The ultimate goal is to provide users with a new way to view essential information in an attractive and unobtrusive way.\n\nThe tweak does everything from adding features like current weather conditions and news to displaying your upcoming calendar events, missed phone calls and even text messages right in the Notification Center.\n\nThe latest version, IntelliScreenX 3, looks amazing. I can’t say enough how well it looks. It adds some more customizations such as adding the battery percentage in the Notification Center as well as some really cool transition animations that you can choose from. These animations include:\n\nBlending (default)\n\nBlending & Pull Down\n\nVertical\n\nFade\n\nPull Down & Blend\n\nThe downside to IntelliScreenX 3 is that there is no way to add the IntelliScreenX 3 preferences panel. This is because it is no longer an actual preference panel but now an actual “app”. You can choose to not install this, however it adds some really cool features that you cannot disable such as the weather conditions.\n\nHowever, if you do decide to install it you will get a new application on your SpringBoard called IntelliScreen. If you double-tap this application, it will load up the IntelliScreenX 3 preferences panel.\n\nNow that you are familiar with the tweak, here are my results:\n\nTesting IntelliScreenX 3\n\nI really like this tweak. I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has been really stable for me. I did have one issue in that when the tweak first came out, it would crash when it was loading in the Notification Center.\n\nBut it appears that this was only in the beta. Once it was released to Cydia, it has been working very well. However, I did notice one thing about it when it was first released.\n\nI’m sure that it’s just something that is probably minor, but it’s still worth mentioning. There are times when the weather conditions are displayed in the Notification Center and they are all screwed up. For example, instead of displaying the actual current weather conditions, it will display things like the forecasted conditions or simply show “Unknown”.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that the weather forecast is not extremely accurate. For example, I noticed that it says that it will be raining in my area when it’s actually dry as can be outside.\n\nAnother thing that I didn’t like about this tweak is that it adds a tiny advertisement in the top-left corner of the Notification Center when it loads. To me, that is really annoying, but this is only in the beta version and not in the release version. I’m sure the final version will be just as good as the first.\n\nOverall, I really like this tweak. I do wish that the weather forecast was a little bit more accurate, but this is only in the beta version. I’m sure once the final release hits Cydia it will be perfect. If you are a Notification Center addict like me, you should definitely get this tweak.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?<|endoftext|>Left-hander Jon Lester has been named the American League's Outstanding Pitcher for the month of April, the third time he has won the honor, it was announced Tuesday.\n\nLeft-hander Jon Lester has been named the American League's Outstanding Pitcher for the month of April, the third time he has won the honor, it was announced Tuesday.\n\nLester was 5-1 with a 1.91 ERA in six starts during the month, including the win over the Astros on Sunday night.

These lines of force were called “Maxwell’s lines” and there was a specific equation that went along with them:\n\nBut they were invisible. If you look at a metal rod, you don’t see any lines of force crisscrossing it. But if you take that rod and connect it to a generator (or battery), those lines of force become something else: electric field lines. These lines of force, combined with the equation above, are what light is made of. They are the primary concept in light, electromagnetism, and electricity.\n\nBut what does this have to do with art?\n\nAbout 100 years ago, a man named Moholy-Nagy decided to try and see these lines of force. He wanted to give the lines of force a physical form. He wanted to show people what these lines of force looked like and felt like. He wanted to create art about electromagnetism.\n\nThe end result was art that looked something like this:\n\nThe lines of force are simply lines on a canvas. These lines, when electrified, generate light and become a photograph.\n\nFor the past three months, I’ve been playing with a similar idea. I was working with data from HIV research and the raw data consisted of a bunch of numbers. To give those numbers some meaning, I wanted to create art with them.\n\nTo do that, I needed to find a way to generate the data into some sort of form that could be viewed by a human. I decided to work with a technology that was invented around the same time as Moholy-Nagy: video. But unlike Moholy-Nagy, I didn’t want to create a moving image of the data. I wanted to create a still image of the data.\n\nI decided to create an image that looked something like this:\n\nIn this case, the data is what you’d get from a single scan of a microscope. It consists of a bunch of numbers that describe the HIV virus at the cellular level. By using these numbers and displaying them in a visual form, I’m making it easier to understand the virus.\n\nThe data itself is complicated and hard to understand. But the image itself is simple and easily understandable.\n\nThis is what I’ve spent the last few months working on. I’ve been playing with different technologies, seeing which ones could be used to create the image. I’m using some basic information (dimensions, data, etc.) and processing it into something visual. And what I’m seeing is a ton of colors and lines that look something like this:\n\nIn this image, each color represents a different kind of cell. The more of a certain color, the more of that particular cell is found. The lines are just like the lines of force. If the line is thick, it means there’s a lot of that particular cell. If it’s thin, it means there’s less of that particular cell.\n\nThe above image, by the way, is an image of the HIV virus. The data itself was taken from a paper by Jason Gestal and Monica Malvezzi. I used an algorithm to convert their data into the image above.\n\nMy end goal is to get the image above to look something like this:\n\nThe above image was taken by Eran Hodis at MIT. It shows the formation of HIV in real time. The colors represent different cellular markers (the same as the ones above), while the lines represent time. The HIV virus starts to form at the top of the image. It slowly moves down, changing in shape as it goes. It’s incredible to look at.\n\nThis is what I’m working on now. I want to create my own image of HIV that’s as incredible as Eran’s. To do that, I need to convert the data into something visual. To do that, I need to understand how the data should be visualized. To do that, I’m going to need some help from people more talented than myself.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more, or working on this project, email me at dylan@hiv.colorado.edu.\n\nYou can also follow along on Twitter: @coloradoHIV.<|endoftext|>Table 2.

"United States Army Transportation Corps\n\nThe United States Army Transportation Corps was established in the early twentieth century as a separate bureau in the Department of War. The Transportation Corps was an early application of doctrine developed by the French military officer, Napoleon Bonaparte. That doctrine held that an army’s command and control capabilities should not be limited by the number of soldiers in an army’s ranks. That doctrine held that the head of a nation’s armed forces should have control of the nation’s waterways and that same person should also command the nation’s land forces.\n\nThe transportation needs of the nation’s Army during the first quarter of the 20th century were administered by a variety of bureaus within the War Department, which had total control over the nation’s railroads and inland waterways. That situation was not an efficient use of the nation’s transportation resources. In addition, the use of multiple commands often resulted in transportation-related problems. In 1900 Congress created the Water Transportation Branch of the Army Quartermaster Corps, which began operation on April 1, 1901. The branch was under the direct control of the Quartermaster General. On May 27, 1903, the Army Appropriations Act authorized the War Department to transfer to the new Water Transportation Service all transportation officers, boats, property, records, and funds that had been assigned to the Quartermaster’s department. In 1908 the Water Transportation Service was renamed the Army Transportation Service. In 1913 the Transportation Corps came under the supervision of the Chief of Engineers.\n\nThe transportation branch remained in the Department of War until the establishment of the Transportation Division in the Office of the Chief of Staff on March 11, 1918. On June 5, 1918, Congress passed an act to \"Provide for the more efficient organization and administration of the Army, National Army\". In paragraph 46 of that act, Congress recognized the value of transportation and stated, \"The transportation service for the national army shall be in the charge of the Chief of Transportation, who shall be appointed by the Secretary of War. The Chief of Transportation shall have direct charge of all transportation service in the national army, including railroads, inland waterways, and watercraft, and all their equipment.\"\n\nOn July 9, 1918, Congress created a Water Division in the Office of the Chief of Staff and then on July 29, 1918, transferred all of the Army’s water craft and equipment to the new division. On August 2, 1918, Congress authorized the Secretary of War to create a separate Transportation Corps. On August 5, 1918, the War Department General Order No. 142 established the Transportation Corps and assigned duties and responsibilities.\n\nThe Transportation Corps was established to coordinate the transportation needs of the nation’s Army during wartime. Its mission was to facilitate the movement of personnel and materiel, as well as to maintain the health of the nation’s highways, railroads, waterways, and coastal waterways.\n\nThe Transportation Corps was constituted in 1920, and three years later, in 1923, the Transportation Corps was granted relative rank, and, in 1939, the Transportation Corps was granted combatant status.\n\nThe Transportation Corps was authorized the branch insignia on July 5, 1941, and the distinctive branch insignia in 1959.\n\nIn November, 2008, the US Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, VA hosted an exhibit titled, \"The Transportation Corps: Moving the Force\" which showcased the corps' history from its creation in the Revolutionary War through to its transformation after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nOn 23 December 2008, the American Society of Military Insignia Collectors held its inaugural meeting at the US Army Transportation Museum.\n\nThe Chief of Transportation in the United States Army is a position that was created by an act of Congress on 11 June 1918, to oversee the Army's transportation needs. The Chief of Transportation is responsible for policy, plans, programming, budgets and statistics, procurement, maintenance, leasing, transportation readiness, safety, and security. The current Chief of Transportation is Brigadier General Jeffrey W. Drushal.\n\nThe Chief of Transportation has held a variety of commands and duties. During World War II, the position was known as the Deputy Chief of Transportation, and the office holder was designated as Deputy Chief of Transportation, Office of the Chief of Transportation. During the war, the Deputy Chief was responsible for the Army's rail, water, air, and motor transportation. Following the war, the Army Transportation Corps was reorganized and the Deputy Chief of Transportation was removed from command of the corps. Instead, the Deputy Chief served as the executive officer to the Chief of Transportation.\n\nThe position of Deputy Chief of Transportation was revived in 1950. The Deputy Chief served as the executive assistant to the Chief of Transportation. The Deputy Chief exercised supervision over three separate offices; the Office of Chief of Transportation, the Office of Transportation and the Office of Logistics Support. The Deputy Chief also supervised the Transportation Center at Alabama's Fort McClellan and the Transportation School at Mississippi's Fort Eustis. In 1952, the Deputy Chief was made a member of the Transportation Board. In 1965, the Transportation Board was abolished and its functions were transferred to the Army's Office of the Chief of Transportation. The position of Deputy Chief of Transportation was again abolished.\n\nThe Deputy Chief of Transportation was reinstated in 1989 as a three-star general officer position, reporting to the Army's Vice Chief of Staff. In this position, the Deputy Chief of Transportation was responsible for all transportation matters, and was the executive agent for all Department of Defense transportation matters.\n\nIn 1997, the Deputy Chief of Transportation was moved from reporting to the Army Vice Chief of Staff to reporting to the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics.\n\nOn 4 March 2005, the Deputy Chief of Transportation was moved again, this time reporting to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, G-4.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the Deputy Chief of Transportation was again moved, this time reporting to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, G-4.\n\nOn 19 June 2012, the Deputy Chief of Transportation was moved to reporting to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, G-4.\n\nOn 19 December 2012, the Deputy Chief of Transportation was again moved, this time to reporting to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, G-4.\n\nThe following are the Army transportation and logistics leaders:\n\n\nThe Office of the Chief of Transportation oversees a wide variety of Army transportation-related matters, including: \n\n\nThe Office of Transportation is responsible for the Army's domestic waterborne transportation activities and overseas land transportation.

"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court sentenced 14 people to death on Wednesday for their role in a massacre during religious riots in the western state of Gujarat in 2002, lawyers for the victims said.\n\nRelatives of the victims of the 2002 post-Godhra riots which killed nearly 1,000 people, react as they gather around the van carrying the verdict on the case outside the court in Ahmadabad, February 22, 2012. REUTERS/Amit Dave\n\nThe attack on the Muslim neighbourhood of Naroda Patiya, in which 97 people were killed, was one of a series of riots in Gujarat which left around 1,000 people dead. The state was ruled by Narendra Modi, now prime minister, at the time.\n\nIndia's Supreme Court has said there is no doubt that Modi allowed the riots to happen. In 2012 he told an election rally that he had visited victims in hospital and hugged those crying for help.\n\nModi, a Hindu nationalist, has said he had been unfairly portrayed as anti-Muslim and blamed the riots on \"a chain of minor incidents.\"\n\n\"Under the current circumstances, and to my mind, at least, the chain of events do not seem to suggest a spontaneous reaction,\" the court said in 2012.\n\nA total of 77 people were convicted by the court, while 16 people were acquitted.\n\nMost of those sentenced to death were local politicians and police officers, said Raju Ramachandran, one of the lawyers representing the victims.\n\n\"The judgement is historic,\" he said.\n\nA lawyer for the accused said he would appeal against the verdict.\n\n\"We will appeal in the high court,\" said V.K. Amin, who represented former state minister Maya Kodnani. \"There were no eyewitnesses and this verdict was given on the basis of circumstantial evidence.\"\n\nA spokesman for Modi declined to comment on the case.\n\nAfter the riots, Modi said India had been polarized between \"Hindu and anti-Hindu forces,\" a reference to Hindu nationalists who accuse the secularist opposition Congress party of using the religious divide to win votes.\n\nMany of the riots took place in Gujarat state, where Modi was in power, although other states in the country's northwest, west and east also saw violence.<|endoftext|>The Minnesota Vikings have yet to take the field for training camp. The NFL has yet to play a down.\n\nBut this season has all the makings of a disaster. The Vikings will almost certainly take a step backward in 2017 after a tremendous season that saw them nearly make the NFC Championship Game.\n\nWhat makes this season look even worse for Minnesota is the competition. The NFC North features three teams, including the Vikings, with a chance to contend for the division title. And in the NFC, the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons aren't going anywhere.\n\nHere are three reasons why the Vikings will not only fail to make the playoffs, but also have a losing record this season:\n\n3. The Vikings don't have a quarterback\n\nThis might be the NFL's weakest quarterback division, which is why it's so hard to find a reason the Vikings will make the playoffs. Case Keenum might be the best of the bunch, but he's not an elite quarterback.\n\nThe Vikings need Keenum to play well to compete, but he has not shown the ability to do that. We saw what happens to the Vikings' defense when the offense struggles last season, and the Vikings aren't about to win games 17-13 or 20-17 this season. They need a quarterback to take them over the top, but they don't have one.\n\nRelated This Vikings rookie is drawing a lot of comparisons to Brett Favre\n\n2. The Vikings have a tough schedule\n\nThis should be an obvious point, but it's not. Yes, the Vikings have a rough schedule, but it's the type of schedule a team with a lot of talent can beat. The Vikings have some tough games on their schedule, including the Falcons, Buccaneers and Lions, but there are winnable games, too.\n\nThe Vikings will face the Buccaneers at home, which is a winnable game. They also play the Bears, Bengals and Browns, which should give them a chance to pick up a few wins. The Falcons and Lions are better than the Bears, Bengals and Browns, but they're not unbeatable.\n\nThis isn't an impossible schedule, but it's hard to win with an average quarterback.\n\n1. The Vikings' defense could take a step back\n\nMinnesota's defense was truly elite last season. The Vikings ranked fourth in points allowed, which was a big reason they were able to get to the NFC Championship Game.\n\nBut their defense could take a step back this season. Anthony Barr will return to linebacker after spending most of last season at outside linebacker, which will help the Vikings' defense. But Minnesota has questions at linebacker that could be problematic, which is one reason why the Vikings ranked as our 19th-best defense heading into the season.\n\nThe Vikings have a lot of defensive talent, but there's a lot of uncertainty, too.<|endoftext|>By Claire Bernish\n\nCovered in swastikas and walking through the streets with a Nazi salute, Donald Trump finally did the unthinkable. The GOP nominee on Thursday released a bizarre, cringeworthy television ad—and yes, it’s as racist as you might expect.\n\nThe 2-minute clip begins with ominous music and a shot of Hillary Clinton, whose face morphs into that of a raging demon before being overtaken by a melding of the State of Liberty and the late Hollywood comedian-actor Charlie Chaplin, presumably portraying Adolf Hitler. The Donald Trump-Hitler transformation happens next.\n\nIn the ad, which the Washington Post reports was “placed on cable systems in at least four states,” a narrator ominously warns voters about the election’s stakes, stating, “On November 8th, the establishment will be defending itself, and you, the American people, will be defending our country from the greatest political crime in history.”\n\nThe ad also encourages voters to cast their ballot for the candidate who could literally be the next Hitler, though that’s not his only problem.\n\n“In Hillary Clinton’s America, the system stays rigged against Americans,” the ad claims, “Terrorists invade our nation and advance, and law and order can’t be enforced.”\n\nExcept Clinton’s plan to defeat ISIS isn’t particularly outrageous—or radical. She has vowed to “work closely with our allies to dismantle the global terror network,” and while “we can’t let them have a safe haven,” we “must take the fight to ISIS on the ground.”\n\n“It’s time for a tough, no-nonsense commander-in-chief who will defend our borders,” the narrator states—ignoring the fact Trump has not only used his campaign to prove he isn’t tough, but quite the opposite.\n\nTrump’s ad concludes with a new threat to America: a nuclear arms race, because Clinton doesn’t care enough to ensure the weapons can’t fall into “the hands of the wrong people.”\n\nIn actuality, Clinton has been vocal about ensuring “that people who already have nuclear weapons, including the United States and Russia, are working to reduce their stockpiles” and will “prevent terrorists and rogue states from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.”\n\nThe Post surmises Trump’s ad was created in an attempt to capture the support of voters still undecided—though in the last month, both his polling numbers and party support have plummeted.\n\nHis call for racial profiling, in which Trump insisted he is not a bigot, is far from the only controversy to plague his campaign—and each day, his behavior only becomes more concerning, and more unhinged.\n\nAfter an earlier ad warned voters about the threat of an impending crime wave should Clinton become president, many criticized its unmistakably racist overtones.\n\nIn reality, the nation’s crime rates have steadily decreased for years—but Trump’s ad seems to predict a far more sinister future for America, where police officers are gunned down in cold blood and inner cities resemble Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nHillary Clinton is campaigning on a message of love and inclusiveness, while Donald Trump wants to divide and conquer, and scare voters into believing the country is on the brink of collapse.\n\nWhether you support Clinton or Trump, the choice is clear—at least, we hope it is.\n\nPlease share this article to show Trump’s new racist ad to everyone, because it is disgusting!<|endoftext|>Hello.\n\nWelcome to the Waypoint High School Class of 2016 Yearbook.

Everything came out just as I had hoped. I couldn't have asked for anything better. I ordered from another online store before and was sent the wrong color dress, size and they didn't have the top I had requested. I was not able to get a refund or another top. I was so worried about ordering another dress online but I am glad that I did! The quality of the dress was amazing.

Metaphors are a type of literary device where a thing or idea is referred to by a word or phrase that is symbolic of another thing or idea. They can be used for emphasis, or simply to give readers a clearer understanding of what the writer is trying to convey. For example:\n\nWearing glasses was not a metaphor for her seeing eye. The eye test meant that she was legally allowed to drive without any restrictions.\n\nIn this example, the phrase \"not a metaphor for her seeing eye\" is used to clarify that the previous statement (\"Wearing glasses was a metaphor for her seeing eye\") was not actually a metaphor.\n\nThere are many types of metaphors:\n\nDirect Metaphors - These are the most common types of metaphors, which directly compare two or more items or ideas. For example: \"Wearing glasses was not a metaphor for her seeing eye.\"\n\nConcealed Metaphors - In these types of metaphors, the word or phrase being used as a metaphor is hidden in the sentence. For example: \"Jack was having an awful day. His teacher was a dunce, his math homework was harder than it should be, his lunch was completely inedible, and he was sure that he had gotten a cavity after eating a particularly hard-bitten caramel.\" In this example, the words \"was having\" and \"was\" are being used to give a more detailed explanation of what happened, but they are also being used to describe a day as being \"awful\" and a teacher as being \"dunce\".\n\nDichotomy - This type of metaphor compares two different, usually opposite, things or ideas in order to emphasize how different they are. For example: \"When it comes to desserts, I'm as tough as nails, but when it comes to paper cuts, I'm as soft as an open wound.\"\n\nOther types of metaphors - There are many other types of metaphors, and some can be hard to recognize. For example:<|endoftext|>Photographer: Jean-Marc Bouchard\n\nStylist: Elle Flanders\n\nStylist Assistant: Rebekah Kashi\n\nHair Stylist: Nick Thomas\n\nMakeup Artist: Janice D'Arcangelo\n\nModel: Kate as Snow White courtesy of Divas Model Management\n\nAssistant Stylist: Emily Velez\n\nModel Assistant: Taryn Collingwood\n\nEarrings by: Lobbs Jewellers\n\nJewelry for Snow White by: Nick Thomas\n\nTransportation by: Round the World Car Rental\n\nAn Interview with Photographer Jean-Marc Bouchard\n\n-This is your second time photographing Snow White.

At the time of the accident the aircraft had logged 24,322 hours of flight time, and it had accumulated 12,200 cycles, of which 6,600 had been as a passenger aircraft.\n\nThe aircraft had been repaired several times during its career, including repair to the front part of the fuselage in 1981, and had last undergone major maintenance on 12 April 2006. The aircraft had been given a complete overhaul before the crash. The aircraft had its last major inspection on 8 April 2006.\n\nFlight 4347 was on a flight from Faro Airport in the Algarve, Portugal to Son Bonet Airport in Girona, Spain. The aircraft was carrying out its third flight of the day, after two successful landings at Faro Airport. At 08:42 local time (07:42 UTC) on 27 July 2006, the aircraft crashed on a ridge while on approach to Son Bonet Airport. The aircraft struck the ridge at an elevation of , and exploded on impact, leaving little wreckage at the crash site. All of the passengers and crew died in the crash.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the wreckage of the aircraft. The CVR was recovered from the wreckage with the cockpit recording module detached, and the FDR was recovered in two pieces. Both CVR and FDR were undamaged, and were sent to the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) for analysis. The aircraft was fitted with a Honeywell Mark 541 inertial reference unit and a Honeywell dual ACARS datalink unit, which were both recovered in good condition. The cockpit voice recorder contained 85 hours of recording, including the last 30 minutes of the flight. The flight data recorder contained over 25 hours of data, including a detailed data block showing the position of the aircraft over the preceding 24 hours.\n\nThe flight had left Faro Airport at 06:47 UTC (05:47 local time) on 27 July 2006. The captain of the flight had flown the route once before, and the first officer had flown the route twice. Both pilots were well rested and met the requirements for the flight. There were nine passengers on board the aircraft.\n\nDuring the flight, air traffic controllers in Girona provided clearance for Flight 4347 to land on Runway 26. The flight was given landing clearance, and the flight crew contacted the controller, who provided the runway heading and the distance to the runway. The crew received a windshear warning shortly after the aircraft passed over a ridge at a height of . The aircraft was able to maintain its height. During the landing approach the crew reported that the aircraft was unstabilized, and the crew continued to work the controls.\n\nThe aircraft touched down on the runway before the runway threshold and overshot the runway. The aircraft had touched down at a speed of . The aircraft contacted a ridge, and began to break up. After the impact, the cockpit voice recorder recorded an explosion in the cockpit.

The aircraft took off from Son Bonet Airport at 08:11 local time, and landed back at Faro Airport at 08:27 local time. Flight 4347 was scheduled to depart from Faro Airport at 08:40 local time, but was delayed by four minutes.\n\nThe accident aircraft had been checked by maintenance engineers at Faro Airport. Following the checks the aircraft was released to operate a flight to Son Bonet Airport. The aircraft's flight log showed that the aircraft had been operated on two flights since the check was carried out, and the aircraft had accumulated approximately 12 hours flight time on its third flight. The aircraft had accumulated a total of 24,322 flight hours, of which 3,700 had been flown as a passenger airliner. The aircraft had logged 12,200 cycles, of which 6,600 had been as a passenger aircraft. The aircraft was on its third flight of the day, and had been used to transport passengers on a round trip flight to Faro. The crew of the aircraft had been well rested. There were no injuries reported to the aircraft or any other aircraft that had landed at Faro Airport.\n\nThe investigation team reviewed the black box data, witness reports, and photographs of the accident.

The aircraft struck the ground with its landing gear retracted. The aircraft broke up, and the cockpit section, with the engine still running, continued to move forward after the aircraft had stopped. The aircraft exploded, and the remains of the aircraft were scattered over a radius. The remains of the crew and passengers were located within a radius.\n\nIt was reported that the terrain was not charted accurately, and that there were no warnings given to the crew. It was also reported that the aircraft struck a ridge during its approach to Runway 26 at Son Bonet Airport.\n\nThe captain of the flight had previous experience of landing at Son Bonet Airport. However, the accident aircraft had never been operated by Eirjet before, and the first officer had flown the route only twice. It was reported that the crew had no training in respect of instrument approaches.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were sent to the AAIB, where they were analysed. The CVR was not damaged during the crash, and was intact when recovered. The FDR was undamaged during the recovery. Both units were sent to the AAIB in the United Kingdom for analysis.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder contained 85 hours of data. The CVR recorded the last 30 minutes of the flight. The FDR contained over 25 hours of data, including a detailed data block showing the position of the aircraft over the preceding 24 hours.\n\nThe CVR was analysed by the AAIB in the United Kingdom. The cockpit crew spoke English, and the quality of the recording was found to be very good. A transcript of the recording was created, and a total of 27 minutes of the recording was selected for further analysis.\n\nThe analysis of the CVR showed that the aircraft was in a normal cruising configuration on the approach to Son Bonet Airport. It was reported that there was no evidence of any unusual aircraft movements or indications. The wind was reported to have been from the south-east at , and the runway at Son Bonet Airport was reported to have been dry at the time of the approach.\n\nDuring the approach to Son Bonet Airport the flight crew received a windshear warning, which they ignored.

Here's what you need to know about their opponent.\n\nWho is Cleveland's best pitcher?\n\nThe Tribe's biggest strength is starting pitching, especially the top three.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCleveland’s No. 1 starter, a workhorse named Corey Kluber, has been nearly unhittable this season. He won 18 games, with an American League-best 268 strikeouts. He was a Cy Young Award finalist.\n\nCleveland’s other two starters, Trevor Bauer and Josh Tomlin, are not far behind. Bauer was a rookie this season but made 30 starts.\n\nThe pitching staff is deep, with only two pitchers with more than 50 appearances. In other words, manager Terry Francona can stay with his rotation and not go to the bullpen until he needs to.\n\nWhat about the hitters?\n\nThe Indians are not a typical powerhouse.\n\nNo player hit more than 18 home runs this season. Only three players reached double digits.\n\nWhat the Indians have is a lineup that is well-balanced and a group of sluggers at the bottom of the order.\n\nOne of the big reasons for Cleveland’s success this season was a revamped lineup. They added free-agent outfielder Rajai Davis, who brought speed and timely hitting.\n\nIt will be up to the top of the order to set the table. With Francona’s strategy, though, he can make substitutions if a certain batter is struggling.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nWhile Chicago is celebrating its first trip to the World Series since 1945, Cleveland fans are celebrating their first since 1997.\n\nAs of Sunday, the average asking price for a ticket was $2,517.41. The most expensive ticket was going for $7,690.\n\nWhile Cubs fans will be watching the World Series for the first time since 1945, it's a more familiar scene for Tribe fans, who are watching for the first time since 1997.\n\nA victory on Wednesday would mean more than a championship for the city of Cleveland.\n\nThe city has gone through several years of hard times after the steel industry fell. Cleveland was the poster child for the national decline of manufacturing.\n\nBut a victory would help the city lift its spirits and bring more stability to a community still on the mend.<|endoftext|>http://www.flickr.com/photos/86375440@N08/3166980347/\n\nFrederick County, Md. has some of the best biking and walking trails in the Washington, D.C., area.

The report is one of the best tools available to consumers to determine if a particular health care facility provides quality care to patients.\n\n\n\nNot all health care facilities receive a report. Those that do receive a report do so by meeting specific Medicare requirements.\n\n\n\nTo receive a report, a facility must:\n\n1. Accept Medicare patients.\n\n2. Operate a Medicare provider number.\n\n3. Report a minimum of 10% of all Medicare claims to Medicare in order to be statistically significant.\n\n4. Have a quality data set (QDS) of at least 3,000 patient records.\n\n5. Have at least three Medicare claims in the last three years.\n\n\n\nThese are the five requirements necessary for a facility to be eligible for a report.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the report is only available to facilities that are using Medicare as their main billing source. If your facility is not eligible for a report, this means that your facility does not have a sufficient number of Medicare patients.\n\n\n\nCMS uses four categories for ranking facilities: A, B, C, and D. Each of these four categories are further divided into three levels, which are represented by three stars (***), two stars (**), and one star (*).\n\n\n\nA: Three Stars (***)\n\nB: Two Stars (**)\n\nC: One Star (*)\n\n\n\nSo, the better the facility performs, the higher the rating will be. If a facility does not receive a report, the rating will be \"**\" (two stars). This is an indication that there were not enough patients with Medicare coverage.\n\n\n\nA one star (*), two star (**), or three star (***) rating, is also called a \"star\" rating. A star rating is the result of an extensive quality assessment.\n\n\n\nYou may also see the stars translated into an A, B, C, and D rating. A is the highest, D is the lowest. A three star (***) facility is a higher rating than a two star (**) facility.\n\n\n\nAs a rule, consumers tend to focus on the star ratings. The star ratings are usually given first and the detailed information on how the star ratings were determined comes second. A three star (***) rating means the facility performed better than the majority of facilities within the same category. But, there is more information that you need to know.\n\n\n\nIf your facility is eligible for a report, the report will be published on your facility's Medicare profile. To find the profile, go to Medicare's home page and search for your facility. Then, click on \"find patient's doctor.\"\n\n\n\nClicking on the link will open your facility's Medicare profile. In the profile, the report will be listed under \"quality of care.\" The report is located at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\nTo access the report, click on \"quality of care.\" Your report will then be displayed. You will also see a table that shows how your facility performed in comparison to other facilities in the same category.\n\n\n\nThe report is broken down into two sections. The first section shows how the facility performed for specific services. The second section shows the overall star rating of the facility.\n\n\n\nFor specific services, the report shows how your facility performed compared to other facilities. The report also shows the facility's star rating and the percentage of Medicare patients the facility has treated.\n\n\n\nThe overall star rating shows how the facility did compared to other facilities within the same category. The overall star rating will show the facility's ranking, its star rating, and the number of stars the facility received.\n\n\n\nThe following is a brief overview of the report, the first section, and the second section.\n\n\n\nThe first section contains five sections. Each section deals with a specific area. They are listed as follows:\n\n\n\n- Key quality measures\n\n- Performance and outcomes\n\n- Patient experience\n\n- Staffing\n\n- Provider contract\n\n\n\nWithin each section, the report includes information on the following:\n\n\n\n- The number of eligible patients the facility had within a certain period of time\n\n- How the facility compared to the national average and other facilities within the same category\n\n- How the facility's patients compare to national data\n\n- The amount of improvement the facility has made over time\n\n\n\nThe first section gives detailed information on how the facility is performing in relation to the national average.\n\n\n\nThe second section is the overall star rating. It shows the facility's overall ranking, its star rating, and the number of stars it received. The overall star rating is the most important part of the report because it indicates how the facility performed compared to other facilities within the same category.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, not all facilities are eligible for a report. If your facility is eligible, a report will be available on your facility's Medicare profile. Consumers can access the report by going to Medicare's home page and searching for their facility.\n\n\n\nThen, they can click on \"find patient's doctor.\" Clicking on the link will open the facility's Medicare profile. In the profile, the report will be listed under \"quality of care.\" Clicking on the report will display the report.\n\n\n\nIf your facility is eligible for a report, it is important to read the report carefully. It provides detailed information on the quality of care your facility provides. This information is very important for your facility to maintain and improve its service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
